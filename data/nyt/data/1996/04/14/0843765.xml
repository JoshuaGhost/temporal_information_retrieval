        <p>A health insurance company with close political and financial ties to Republican leaders stands to benefit substantially from a proposal that conservative Republicans want to add to a major health insurance bill scheduled  for debate next week on the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>The proposal, already approved by the House, would create tax incentives for  people to set up medical savings accounts to pay health care expenses. The company, the Golden Rule Insurance Company, sells a special type of health insurance that would have to be purchased by people with such tax-free accounts.</p>
        <p>The insurance has high deductibles and relatively low premiums but would pay medical bills exceeding the amount for which the patient was responsible -- $1,500 a year for an individual and $3,000 for a family, under the House bill. The proposal would allow people to put pretax dollars into the medical savings accounts to pay their deductibles.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the Senate and House bills is to guarantee that people in employer-sponsored health plans would be able to get health insurance after switching or losing their jobs. But some Republican senators, like House Republican leaders, insist that the bill must also encourage medical savings accounts.</p>
        <p>Many experts on health care and insurance say such accounts are, at best, a quirky idea that would be worth trying on only a small scale, with proper safeguards for consumers. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that a million households would establish the accounts under the bill approved late last month by the House.</p>
        <p>The proposal is generating political passion out of proportion to the number  of people expected to sign up. Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republicans say that medical savings accounts would give consumers a wider choice of health insurance options, strong new incentives to control health costs and more control over the use of the money earmarked for health care.</p>
        <p>But many Democrats denounce the accounts as bad health policy, and they say that the proposal is being pushed by Republicans as a reward to Golden Rule and  its former chairman, J. Patrick Rooney, a strong supporter of Republican causes. His father founded the company, and his family controls it.</p>
        <p>The medical savings accounts would work this way: An employer or an employee  could put money into the account, and that money would belong to the employee. Any money not used in one year could be carried over and invested, like the money in an individual retirement account. Earnings on such investments would not be taxed, and money withdrawn from a medical savings account would not be subject to income tax if it was used for medical expenses.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the debate is an empirical question: are healthy people more  likely than sick people to establish medical savings accounts? Most Democrats say yes, while Republicans say no.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office and the American Academy of Actuaries share the concern that younger, healthier people would be more inclined to choose medical savings accounts and the high-deductible insurance policies that go with them.</p>
        <p>Democrats say that sick people and those with chronic health problems would prefer conventional insurance because the deductibles are much lower: an average of $250 a year for individuals and $600 for families. Patients are personally responsible for those amounts, and sick people generally know they will have higher medical expenses, so they will shun the high-deductible policies, the Democrats say. They say healthier people would have more to gain from medical savings accounts because they would have more money left over at the end of a year.</p>
        <p>Republicans, by contrast, say the high-deductible policies would also appeal  to sick people because the policies could provide unlimited protection against catastrophic medical expenses after the deductibles were met. Insurers now often set annual or lifetime limits on the benefits that will be paid for a subscriber.</p>
        <p>But Cathy L. Hurwit, legislative director of Citizen Action, a consumer group with three million members, said, "In theory, the insurance company would pay all health care costs once you pay your deductible, but nothing in the House bill requires that."</p>
        <p>Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said on the House floor last month that the Republican proposal was "a payoff to the Golden Rule Insurance Company" -- a characterization disputed by Republican leaders and Golden Rule executives.</p>
        <p>Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, Democrat of Georgia, asked on the House floor: "Why medical savings accounts? Just follow the money. The Golden Rule Insurance Company has given more than $1.4 million to the G.O.P., and, coincidentally, Golden Rule just happens to be the premier company peddling medical savings accounts."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney offered slightly different numbers. In an interview, he said that  he and Golden Rule employees had given $1.1 million to the Republican National Committee and Republican candidates for Congress since January 1993. Common Cause, the public affairs lobby, said that Mr. Rooney and John M. Whelan, Golden Rule's president, had given more than $117,000 to Gopac, the political action committee that helped Mr. Gingrich take control of the House.</p>
        <p>Golden Rule, which describes itself as one of the biggest suppliers of health insurance to individuals and small groups and says it covers about 1.8 million people, has shown persistence in trying to promote medical savings accounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney, a maverick in the insurance industry, said: "I support medical savings accounts because I believe they are good for the American people. It's no shock to me that I am being condemned, or my company is being condemned. We are caught up in the conflict between the two parties."</p>
        <p>But Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said, "We're afraid that medical savings accounts will segment the market into people who are very healthy and people who are not healthy." If that happens, she said, "you lose the whole principle of insurance, which is cross-subsidy," with premiums being collected from people who are healthy today to subsidize care for the sick.</p>
        <p>"You need a mix of people who are using health care services and people who are not to make it affordable for everyone," Ms. Lehnhard said.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress say the overall health insurance bill has an excellent chance of becoming law, but the outlook for medical savings accounts is less clear. Mr. Gingrich said he would not risk a Presidential veto over the issue, but other conservatives planned to fight for the accounts in a House-Senate conference.</p>
        <p>The bill scheduled for debate next week is sponsored by Senators Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Conservative Republicans say they will propose amendments to encourage medical savings accounts. Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Kennedy and the White House oppose such amendments, saying they could sink the bill.</p>
        <p>The House and Senate bills would restrict practices that insurers use to identify people with medical problems. Mr. Rooney said that Golden Rule sometimes denied coverage to such people or charged them high premiums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whelan defended those practices in testimony before Congress in 1994. "Fire insurance is not provided after the house catches fire," he said, "nor is auto-theft insurance provided after the car is stolen. To provide health coverage to people for a medical condition which has already occurred may be charitable; it is not the business of insurance."</p>
        <p>But Ms. Hurwit of Citizen Action said: "The idea that health insurance is only for the healthy is absurd. Eighty-one million people have some form of health problem that could be labeled a pre-existing condition, everything from asthma to cancer."</p>
        <p>Golden Rule has resisted efforts by several states to require the sale of health insurance to all applicants and to limit premium variations.</p>
        <p>When New Hampshire was considering such legislation in 1993, State Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, issued a news release saying, "Golden Rule represents everything that is wrong with health care in America." She asserted that the company had "resorted to lies and half-truths," telling policyholders that their premiums would soar. In Kentucky, State Representative Ernesto Scorsone, a Democrat, said that Golden Rule had run a campaign of "disinformation, misinformation and outright deception."</p>
        <p>Mr. Whelan acknowledged that the company's lobbying had been "forceful and aggressive." But he said that Golden Rule had violated no laws and was merely trying to protect policyholders.</p>
