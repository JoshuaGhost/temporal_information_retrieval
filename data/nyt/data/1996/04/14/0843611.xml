        <p>PARSLEY is the herb taken for granted. A few sprigs solve the garnish problem. A scattering of chopped leaves enlivens almost any dish with a bright bit of green.</p>
        <p>But parsley can take a more assertive role, becoming the primary component of a sauce. Not only can it stand in for basil in a pesto, it can also be the basis of a variety of green sauces like those that follow. And it is the essential seasoning for classic boiled potatoes.</p>
        <p>Flat-leaf Italian parsley is usually preferred by chefs for its richer flavor. Curly parsley makes a prettier garnish.</p>
        <p>Salmon in Parsley Sauce  Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>3tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley 4teaspoons capers 1tablespoon finely minced scallion 1teaspoon finely minced garlic 1/3cup extra-virgin olive oil 2pounds salmon fillets, cut in 6 portions Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1tablespoon fresh lemon juice.</p>
        <p>1. Combine the parsley, capers, scallion and garlic in a bowl. Stir in half the olive oil. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat a broiler or grill. Brush the salmon with the remaining oil and broil or grill close to the source of heat about two minutes on each side for medium rare, or to desired degree of doneness. Remove from the heat and allow to rest two minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Season the salmon to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Add the lemon juice to the parsley mixture, brush this mixture over the salmon and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>

        <p>2 1/2pounds small new potatoes, peeled Salt 2tablespoons unsalted butter 2tablespoons finely minced flat-leaf parsley Freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Place the potatoes in a saucepan with salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook about 20 minutes, until the potatoes are  tender. Drain them and return to the saucepan.</p>
        <p>2. Add the butter and roll the potatoes in it until it melts. Gently toss the potatoes in the parsley, season with salt and pepper and serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>

        <p>1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Trim the artichokes by slicing off half an inch of the top, slicing off any stems and pulling off the tougher outer leaves.</p>
        <p>3. Toss the artichokes with the lemon juice and olive oil in an oven-proof dish. Scatter the garlic on top and drizzle with three-fourths cup of water or stock. Cover and bake about 30 minutes, until the artichokes are tender.</p>
