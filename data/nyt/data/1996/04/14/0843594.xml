        <p>AS the first half of The Hills, a huge housing community that has risen over  the last 14 years within the folds of the Watchung Hills in Bedminster Township, is nearing completion, activity is churning here on its second half on the other side of the hill.</p>
        <p>Construction is under way on some of the 1,000 town houses and one-family detached homes, priced from $184,000 to $1 million, in 10 separate second-stage  enclaves. An 18-hole public golf course is also under way. Ultimately there will be 1,893 units on the Bernards Township side of the hill. They will join the 2,835 residences on the Bedminster side.</p>
        <p>The Bedminster site has 350,000 square feet of commercial space built and occupied. A total of 50,000 square feet will be built in Bernards Township.</p>
        <p>The Hills, one of the state's largest planned developments, will cover 1,800  acres in these wealthy Somerset County towns, where Interstates 287 and 78 cross. The development was born of the first lawsuit under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines and is the first to meet the Mount Laurel goal of producing housing for people making no more than 80 percent of an area's median income. To do this, a municipality is required only to rezone to provide the opportunity to build such housing.</p>
        <p>But the development's progress also reflects the changing face of the Mount Laurel process. And it underscores how developers must adjust to keep construction moving in so large a community.</p>
        <p>The housing here, for example, is being done by six builders. Among them are  the state's largest, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, which is building 348 town houses, and Toll Brothers of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., which is constructing  137 homes. Matzel &amp; Mumford of Hazlet is building 89 more expensive houses.</p>
        <p>Most of the Bedminster homes were built by the original developer, the Hills  Development Company, which is also building 243 homes on the Bernards Township side. The company is a partnership between Saudi Arabian investors and SD Partners, whose principal is William E. Simon, Secretary of Treasury under President Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>SD bought out the 50 percent share of the site owned by Johns-Mansville Property Corporation, which filed the Mount Laurel suit in 1987, when that company went bankrupt. Gale, Wentworth &amp; Dillon of Florham Park has managed the  project since 1992 and its principal, Thomas H. Dillon, serves as president of the Hills Development Company.</p>
        <p>At first the courts monitored the compliance of municipalities with the Mount Laurel decisions, producing mounds of lawsuits but little housing. In 1985 the Council on Affordable Housing, part of the state's Department of Community Affairs, was created as an alternative.</p>
        <p>In the 80's the Mount Laurel decisions brought about many large developments, typically town-house projects in which four market-rate units were built for every affordable one. But over time alternatives emerged, including a town's option to build or rezone for its allotment of Mount Laurel units or transfer up to 50 percent of its units to an urban center and pay for their construction. And the number of units towns must provide to meet their share of the state's affordable housing needs has been reduced to 86,308 units from 145,707.</p>
        <p>"The process has moved in the direction of cooperation," said Robert Friant,  spokesman for the community affairs agency. He said affordable units represented 12 percent of the 24,000 permits issued in the state last year, compared with 2  percent of the 55,000 issued in 1985. Towns recognize that high-density court-imposed projects are less desirable, he said.</p>
        <p>But in Bedminster, which after an 11-year legal battle rezoned in 1980 to permit Mount Laurel housing, The Hills has 2,835 units. Most are town houses, of which 620 are affordable in terms of the Mount Laurel decision. They sit on 520  acres at 10 units to an acre. In terms of planning "it is too intense a use for  that site, the result of being first and in the aggressive stages of Mount Laurel," said Robert Burchell, a planning professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "There are now less invasive ways to achieve Mount Laurel housing."</p>
        <p>Still the Bedminster project was a success. Mr. Dillon said the reason was its location near I-287 and I-78 and to the corporations along them. All but 75  units have been built and sold, he said.</p>
        <p>In the Bernards Township part of The Hills, which rezoned as part of an out-of-court settlement, there will be 1,893 mostly one-family homes and town houses on 1,280 acres, or 2.7 units an acre. The Hills is paying for the 200 Mount Laurel units proposed for the Bernards Township site to be built in Phillipsburg.</p>
        <p>MR. DILLON said that in 1993 the partners sold lots to buy their "north of $20 million" land-acquisition loan at a discount from the Fidelity Bank, which acquired it after the original bank failed and wanted to be repaid immediately.  Other reasons were to finance site improvements and to take advantage of the area's reviving market, he said. He added that the sections sold had varying lot sizes to insure a diversity of product and price.</p>
        <p>"That area has the key attributes consumers want -- good schools and safety -- and it maintains its housing values," said David Schoner, a housing consultant in Sparta. And it has the amenities to continue to pull in corporations, he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, state planners consider that area -- the intersection of I-287 and I-78 -- a key development site and Somerset County among the fastest growing counties. Its population is expected to rise to 274,897 in 2010 from 240,279 in  1990 and its employment base to expand to 208,165 jobs from 144,915, according to the State Planning Commission.</p>
        <p>Dr. Burchell of Rutgers said The Hills development was "a unique niche in the market since buyers can buy a home at a lower cost in the heart of the state's famous hunt country."</p>
        <p>For developers in Bernards Township, The Hills offers an increasingly rare resource -- approved building lots. Public utilities, roads and amenities, like  a day-care center and pools, are also in place and more are planned. One is the  267-acre golf course being developed by Pinnacle Golf, a subsidiary of Bergstol  Enterprises of New City, N.Y. It will open next spring.</p>
        <p>The trade-off is a higher land cost. Yet the developers of the houses here have taken advantage of The Hills' benefits.</p>
        <p>Hovnanian is building there "because there is enough demand in that market to support new product," said Joseph F. Riggs, president of its north-central New Jersey region. Work is proceeding on the first of the company's two town-house projects. Hamilton Woods contains 198 units with garages, ranging from 1,480 to  2,020 square feet for $184,000 to $249,000. Since sales began last October 50 units have been sold, Mr. Riggs said. He said construction on the second project, with 150 units of the same size and price, would begin before the first was completed.</p>
        <p>Toll Brothers is building two detached, one-family-home projects because "there is a market for higher-priced homes in that area," said Wayne Patterson,  its senior vice president.</p>
        <p>The Meadows at Revere Hill will have 68 houses of 2,500 to 2,900 square feet  on lots averaging 10,000 square feet for $329,900 to $371,000. The Woodlands at  Revere Hill will have 69 houses of 3,000 to 3,500 square feet homes on larger lots, for $412,900 to $465,900. Since sales began last spring 58 homes have been sold, said Mr. Patterson.</p>
        <p>Matzel &amp; Mumford is building the most expensive houses in two subdivisions "because of the availability and quality of the land," said Roger Mumford, a principal.</p>
        <p>Beacon Crest will have 60 houses of 3,000 to 4,000 square feet set on half-acre lots for $499,000 to $600,000. And Beacon Manor will have 29 houses of 4,200 to 5,600 square feet, which buyers can customize, set on 2- to 13-acre lots. Base prices are $700,000 to $1 million. So far 50 homes have been sold, Mr. Mumford said.</p>
        <p>By June, construction will begin on six custom-designed homes to be built on  lots fronting the golf course by the Bocina Homes Corporation of Basking Ridge.  The 4,000- to 6,000-square-foot homes are to sell for $700,000 to $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dillon said Hills Development maintained architectural control over the new homes "to retain the project's integrity." The company "will continue to sell land, but it is not in any rush," he added, noting that he expected the Bernards Township land to be developed over the next seven years.</p>
