        <p>FOR DIRECTORS, ONE NICE thing about video is the chance it gives them to go back and tinker with their old movies. "It's a subjective business and your perception changes," Oliver Stone said the other day. "Years go by, and you want to recut and change things."</p>
        <p>This spring he and another major director, Terry Gilliam, are satisfying that impulse by returning to old films to make "directors' cuts" for tape and laser disk. Not that Mr. Stone is altering his perceptions, at least for now. By restoring 150 trims to his unrelentingly violent and explosively controversial 1994 movie "Natural Born Killers," he is pointedly restating his original notion of the film before it was toned down to get an R rating from the Motion Picture  Association of America.</p>

        <p>FOR DIRECTORS, ONE NICE thing about video is the chance it gives them to go back and tinker with their old movies. "It's a subjective business and your perception changes," Oliver Stone said the other day. "Years go by, and you want to recut and change things."</p>
        <p>This spring he and another major director, Terry Gilliam, are satisfying that impulse by returning to old films to make "directors' cuts" for tape and laser disk. Not that Mr. Stone is altering his perceptions, at least for now. By restoring 150 trims to his unrelentingly violent and explosively controversial 1994 movie "Natural Born Killers," he is pointedly restating his original notion of the film before it was toned down to get an R rating from the Motion Picture  Association of America.</p>
        <p>In July, Vidmark will release a tape of the longer "Natural Born Killers" -- the story of two young outlaws (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) on a killing spree -- and Pioneer will issue a special edition on disk. The additions, amounting to about three minutes of running time, put back every fleeting glimpse of murder and mayhem excised to avoid an NC-17 rating, which would have  barred children under the age of 17 and limited the film's release in theaters.</p>
        <p>"If I'm going to take the heat, let them see what I did, not a compromised version," said Mr. Stone, whose most recent film was "Nixon."</p>
        <p>With the extra room they provide for documentaries, interviews, commentary, and other printed and recorded material, special editions are appealing to directors. Mr. Gilliam, whose newest film is "12 Monkeys," has made three of them -- "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"  and "The Fisher King" -- for the Criterion Collection, a line of laser editions  from Voyager, a New York electronic publisher.</p>
        <p>At present, he is overhauling "Brazil," his acclaimed 1985 film about the uproarious tribulations of a clerk (Jonathan Pryce) snagged in the gears of a surrealistic totalitarian society. In the fall, Voyager will release the revised movie along with commentary by the director and a raft of other items drawn from scripts, storyboards and production notes. "I sent them just a trunkful of stuff," Mr. Gilliam said.</p>
        <p>The "Killers" laser package will include similar items and a documentary about audience reaction to the film. Charles Kiselyak of Pioneer said studios were more responsive to disk projects than to theatrical re-releases, which are  costlier to market. "Special editions make everybody more willing to do a director's cut," he said.</p>
        <p>But what constitutes a pure director's cut? Action films and erotic thrillers are sometimes shot with extra scenes of sex and violence that are left out of theatrical releases but are later pumped into videos, which are then promoted as directors' cuts and issued unrated or perhaps with an NC-17. A true director's cut is the movie the director wants artistically but sometimes isn't allowed because it's too long, too sexy, too violent or too whatever else might displease the studio or perhaps the M.P.A.A. ratings panel.</p>
        <p>"Natural Born Killers" was such a case. "I had to deliver an R," Mr. Stone said.</p>
        <p>Warner distributed the R-rated film in theaters and on videocassette but turned down Mr. Stone's request to make a director's cut for a new video release and eventually sold the rights to Trimark, Vidmark's parent company. Warner officials won't comment, but the studio is said to have backed away last summer  after a speech by Senator Bob Dole that characterized "Natural Born Killers" and other films and gangsta rap recordings as "nightmares of depravity."</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole, of course, was referring to the R-rated "Natural Born Killers." Mr. Stone describes the more violent version as a fulfillment of his original artistic intention. The purpose, he said, was to depict a society saturated with extreme violence, and the way to do that palatably was to exaggerate situations  so they became almost comical. But to get the R, bits of gore and chaos were whittled throughout, and that, Mr. Stone said, threw off the rhythm and undermined integrity.</p>
        <p>"Philosophically, it unbalanced the film," said Hank Corwin, one of the movie's two editors. "They were trying to take out violence, but what they were  doing was eliminating elements that made it more of a satire."</p>
        <p>Artistic distinctions notwithstanding, Mr. Dole and other critics are not likely to be assuaged by the new "Natural Born Killers," which, among many tiny  restorations of assault and bloodshed, incorporates graphic scenes of torture and death during a prison riot. This includes the dismemberment of the warden, played by Tommy Lee Jones.</p>
        <p>Again, Mr. Stone said, the intent was satiric: "It's the apocalypse; the world is coming to an end. He's impaled. All his limbs come off. It's very funny, actually -- throwing them up in the air." Such touches, he added, make the movie more ridiculous and comedic. "People think there's no humor in this film. You'd have to be on another planet to think that."</p>
        <p>But he also acknowledges the effect "Natural Born Killers" can have on people. "The most pacifistic people in the world said they came out of this movie and wanted to kill somebody," Mr. Stone said, adding that the experience at least made them realize that they, too, possessed feelings of aggression. Just last month, the uncut "Natural Born Killers" was banned in Britain after 16 young children and a teacher were gunned down at a school in Scotland.</p>
        <p>However one regards the new video, it gives back to Mr. Stone the movie he originally made. Two years ago he compromised only to avoid trouble, for all the good it did him. "Once a film gets plagued by the concept of trouble, it doesn't help," he said. " 'Brazil' comes to mind."</p>
        <p>Not as notorious as "Natural Born Killers" certainly, "Brazil" is no stranger to controversy. "It's a hot potato, always has been," Mr. Gilliam said. Ordinarily, he explained, he leaves his movies pretty much alone, but this one is an exception. The Voyager special edition will mix parts of two versions of "Brazil," one released in Europe, the other in America. To Mr. Gilliam, though,  the laser disk won't be the film's first director's cut; he had approved both versions 10 years ago, making each a director's cut. "It seems to me that if a film has your name on it, that's the director's cut," he said. "I'll stand by the American version as much as the European."</p>
        <p>SCENES THAT PLAYED abroad were dropped from the American movie and vice versa. In a noted row with Universal, the distributor, Mr. Gilliam shortened the film as required but balked when asked to provide a happy, or happier, ending. Universal then refused to release the movie, relenting only after Los Angeles critics voted it the best picture of the year.</p>
        <p>So far the Voyager restoration project is on course. "There are a lot of physical pieces -- soundtracks, negatives -- that are all supposed to be stored  together but get scattered when you start making prints for different countries," Mr. Gilliam said. "Some of them are missing already, and this is a film that was made only 12 years ago. That's what's frightening about films. They're much more delicate than people think they are. Studios are constantly selling them, but when buyers start digging out what they think they've bought,  it won't be there."</p>
        <p>In the case of "Brazil," however, what Voyager needs is available and in good condition. Karen Stetler, who is supervising the special edition, has been in London helping Mr. Gilliam fit together pieces of his choosing that will go onto the master tape and then be transferred to disk. "Twelve years actually isn't that long in terms of film preservation," Ms. Stetler said. "Everything has been properly stored. The color is gorgeous. Backup elements are nice and pristine."</p>
        <p>The disk includes a scene from the European ending, cut to shorten the American movie, in which the clerk is charged a fee for his own interrogation and torture. "The film began with this idea about 17th-century witch trials where you were charged for every fingernail they tore out and for every bundle of fagots they used for your burning," Mr. Gilliam said. "That's the good thing  about these laser editions -- getting this back on disk. They are really the best archive that exists out there because of the care and kind of detail devoted to them. They put a lot more effort into them than the studios do."</p>
        <p>For now, though, the director is choosing his scenes. "I think I'll start American," he said, "the camera flying through the clouds."</p>
        <p>FILM  Correction:  April 28, 1996, Sunday</p>
        <p>An article on April 14 about how directors adjust their films for release on  video referred incorrectly to the video version of Oliver Stone's film "Natural  Born Killers." After the killing of 16 children and a teacher in March at a school in Dunblane, Scotland, Warner Home Video stopped distributing "Natural Born Killers" in Britain; the video was not banned there.</p>
