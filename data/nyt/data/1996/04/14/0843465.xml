        <p>THE Rev. Rayner (Rusty) Hesse likes to tell people he is bivocational -- and  he gets even more of a kick out of their reactions when they learn the two vocations are Episcopal priest and dealer of antiques and collectibles.</p>
        <p>Yet the professions are not so different as one might think. The confessions  Mr. Hesse hears in Memory Lane, his store here, often require tact and compassion from the listener. To be sure, customers come in daily looking for no more than a beautiful piece of furniture or a fascinating old bauble, but there  are also those who arrive bearing objects that they are parting with only as a last resort; those who must literally sell their grandmother's silver -- or father's antique golf clubs or mother's cameo pendant -- in order to pay bills,  or rent, or taxes. Some, Mr. Hesse said, show up with tears streaming down their faces.</p>

        <p>THE Rev. Rayner (Rusty) Hesse likes to tell people he is bivocational -- and  he gets even more of a kick out of their reactions when they learn the two vocations are Episcopal priest and dealer of antiques and collectibles.</p>
        <p>Yet the professions are not so different as one might think. The confessions  Mr. Hesse hears in Memory Lane, his store here, often require tact and compassion from the listener. To be sure, customers come in daily looking for no more than a beautiful piece of furniture or a fascinating old bauble, but there  are also those who arrive bearing objects that they are parting with only as a last resort; those who must literally sell their grandmother's silver -- or father's antique golf clubs or mother's cameo pendant -- in order to pay bills,  or rent, or taxes. Some, Mr. Hesse said, show up with tears streaming down their faces.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon he pointed out a round dining-room table, circa 1900,  made of solid-looking oak. Last year, shortly before April 15, a young couple came to him and said they had no money to pay their income taxes. "It's what they were eating off of, but they had to sell it," Mr. Hesse recalled. "We bought it from them for close to what we are selling it for." The price tag on the table reads $500.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hesse also showed a visitor two crystal lamps with lusters, which he is selling for $550 for the pair. Not long ago they belonged to an elderly woman living in a big house; when she sold the place to move to a smaller home, she had to sell most of the things in it in order to pay a capital-gains tax.</p>
        <p>"We hear a lot of sad stories because we get called in when people are in trouble, and because we handle estate sales when there has been a death," Mr. Hesse said. "Objects can hold tremendous meaning; they hold so many memories for people. We understand why they are hard to part with. So we like to think that by acquiring, displaying and possibly selling an object, we give it a new phase, a continued life, in a sense."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hesse, who is 40, always knew he wanted to be a priest. Ordained at 26, he served full time at St. John's in Getty Square in Yonkers, then at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Hartsdale. During those years he helped found a number of organizations for the needy, including Food Patch, Coalition for the Homeless and the Sharing Community.</p>
        <p>But several years ago, he began feeling a need to take a break from the full-time ministry and the intense demands of social-service work, and he sought a part-time position at St. John's Wilmot, the tiny, 20-member congregation in New Rochelle where he now preaches. He also realized he wanted "equity -- a place of my own" and decided to start a business based on his lifelong love of searching for and finding beautiful and unusual things. In 1992, he opened Memory Lane.</p>
        <p>These days, the store hold thousands of objects ranging from 50 cent paperback books to a $10,000 Hepplewhite sideboard. In addition to keeping regular store hours on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.  and Thursdays and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. (he preaches Sunday mornings), he  holds auctions at a storefront he recently leased at the White Plains Mall on Hamilton Avenue in White Plains on Friday nights. He also handles the disposition of estates, wherein, he said, "We do everything from literally cleaning out the refrigerator" to moving and selling the furniture.</p>
        <p>These can yield surprises, some of which, Mr. Hesse said, "are real treasures." In one house, buried deep in a closet, he found a pair of diamond earrings wrapped in tissue paper stuffed into an empty Sucrets box hidden in the toe of a shoe. While going through another house, his workers discovered valuable memorabilia from the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. And in yet another home, $27,000 was found wedged under a floorboard -- along with the cremated remains of a family member.</p>
        <p>All money, of course, is returned to the owner's relatives or heirs, but most of the objects found during estate searches wind up in the store or on the auction block.</p>
        <p>In the shop, Mr. Hesse has china, crystal, glassware, sterling silver, furniture, lamps, lace, linens, costume jewelry, dolls, old pens, campaign buttons, sheet music, perfume bottles -- some still filled with perfume -- and hundreds of other items. One corner is even devoted to angels: little sculptures, decoupage boxes and needlepoint cushions with cherub motifs, candles with wax molded into sweet-looking faces and shoulders sprouting wings. Mr. Hesse insists that these have nothing to do with his religious activities, explaining that angels "are highly collectible right now."</p>
        <p>A similar variety is available at auction. On a recent night, Mr. Hesse himself auctioned 115 items, including dozens of old bottles, a strand of sparkling jet beads and a sterling baby cup engraved with the name "Grace," which caused one woman to say, "I wonder what Grace was like and where she is now." Mr. Hesse spoke quickly, but with none of the hard edge of the typical auctioneer, and always with a smile on his face and a touch of humor in his voice. It was easy to imagine him behind the pulpit, delivering some nonjudgmental sermon.</p>
        <p>"He's creative," said Rosemarie Wildulski, a travel agent and collector. "He  has a pleasant way about him."</p>
        <p>He also has something of a following. People who hear him preach are curious  to know what he sounds like selling, and vice versa. Word of the preacher-antiques dealer-auctioneer has spread through Hartsdale, Scarsdale and  beyond; many customers know he is a priest before they walk in the door of Memory Lane. Some, in fact, say they feel particularly comfortable buying from and selling to him, believing that he not only adheres to the ethics of the trade but also answers to a higher authority.</p>
        <p>"I heard about him through someone in my parish," said Jeanne Stapleton Smith, who had come to the shop from her home in White Plains to buy gifts for friends. "It's fascinating that he is a priest and a businessman, and that so many people know of him. It seems that everyone has heard of Rusty."</p>
