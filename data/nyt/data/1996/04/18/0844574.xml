        <p>A doctor accused of killing two of her children in an arson fire and trying to poison her husband pleaded no contest today in exchange for a life prison sentence.</p>
        <p>Dr. Debora Green entered the plea on five charges after the state agreed to drop its request for the death penalty. Dr. Green, 45, was charged with aggravated arson, two counts of capital murder and two counts of attempted murder.</p>
        <p>Dr. Green, who used to practice oncology, was accused of setting the fire on Oct. 24 at her $400,000 house in this suburb of Kansas City, Mo., that killed her 13-year-old son, Tim, and 6-year-old daughter, Kelly. Her 11-year-old daughter, Kate, escaped.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said she tried to kill her estranged husband, Dr. Michael Farrar, a cardiologist, by poisoning his food several times before the fire. Dr. Farrar, 40, had brain surgery late last year because of complications caused by the poisoning.</p>
        <p>Dr. Farrar testified at a hearing in February that he thought his wife was crazy and that he had told her in a telephone call just hours before the fire that he planned to take the children from her.</p>
        <p>Dr. Farrar filed for divorce the day after the fire and sought custody of Kate, who had escaped by climbing to the garage roof and jumping to safety.</p>
        <p>Dr. Green was arrested in November at a Kansas City theater where she had taken Kate to practice for her role in "The Nutcracker."</p>
        <p>The defense tried at the preliminary hearing to turn attention to Tim as a possible culprit, presenting testimony that the boy had a fascination with fire.</p>
        <p>Sentencing for Dr. Green, who has been held under a $3 million bond, was scheduled for May 30.</p>
