        <p>Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy and girl sing wistful theme song you can't possibly get out of your head. There is no cinematic bauble to match "The  Umbrellas of Cherbourg," Jacques Demy's sugar-coated 1964 musical starring a radiant, exquisite 20-year-old Catherine Deneuve as the heroine who is steered by her mother and tearfully betrayed by amour. Mr. Demy's film remains an incredible oddity, from its blazing, audacious color to the fact that its sunny lyrics mention hand grenades and cars needing an oil change. The film, every word, is lip-synched to Michel Legrand's soothing warm bath of a score.</p>
        <p>"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" looks both outre and terrific in the handsomely  restored print beginning a three-week run at the Film Forum today. Three things  to note: The film has long been out of theatrical release, so this is a noteworthy revival. Its simple, bold retro look will now seem startlingly current to anyone still getting over Sabrina-mania.</p>

        <p>And "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" is certainly a throwback to interesting times. It first opened in New York on Dec. 17, 1964, during an eight-day stretch that also brought "Zorba the Greek," "Contempt," "Marriage Italian Style," "Goldfinger," Jerry Lewis in "The Disorderly Orderly," Billy Wilder's "Kiss Me,  Stupid" and John Ford's "Cheyenne Autumn." Not to mention "Ride the Wild Surf,"  starring Fabian and Tab Hunter.</p>
        <p>The Film Forum is at 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Tickets: $8. Box office: (212) 727-8110.</p>
