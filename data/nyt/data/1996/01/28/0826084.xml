        <p>IF conservatives ever chose a political poster child, the halls of Congress might well be pasted with the meaty jowls of John Engler, Michigan's two-term Governor.

        <p>IF conservatives ever chose a political poster child, the halls of Congress might well be pasted with the meaty jowls of John Engler, Michigan's two-term Governor. No other state executive has logged as many hours in the inner councils of the Republican Congress, plotting the demise of the Federal welfare state.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Engler was understandably puzzled last week at the reaction to his latest welfare plan. This time, it was the conservatives who were grumbling. And the people Mr. Engler had spent his career denouncing as Beltway liberals were blowing kisses his way -- albeit with a certain mischief in mind.</p>
        <p>Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, pronounced herself stunned to find Mr. Engler on her left, "but pleased to have him there." Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York hailed the Engler plan as a sign that "sanity may be returning to this debate." Representative Barney Frank, perhaps the most partisan paleoliberal in Congress, said he would file a bill to make the Engler proposal the law of the land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engler would offer poor people services like child care and transportation while requiring them to work, an idea that seems at odds with his earlier purges of 80,000 adults from Michigan's welfare rolls. But unlike the Democrats, he emphatically rejects any notion of making this plan -- or any other -- a Federal requirement.</p>
        <p>By the end of the week, the noise that came crackling from the Governor's car phone wasn't just static, but the sound of his conservative teeth grinding. "I'm delighted to have their praise -- the program deserves their praise," he said. "But the conclusions they're drawing are dead wrong." The conclusions, that is,  about what it all means for the antipoverty debate that is currently stalled in  Congress.</p>
        <p>Democrats crow that Mr. Engler's plan makes the point that there's room for innovation without abolishing the 60-year-old Federal guarantee of aid, known as an "entitlement."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Engler argues that governors govern best when the Feds leave them alone. He wants welfare and other programs converted to lump sum payments called "block grants," with virtually no Federal strings attached.</p>
        <p>"What my program proves -- and what those of other governors prove -- is that we're fully capable of doing the right thing," he said. "Massachusetts will do one thing, Wisconsin will do something else. We'll pick up on those aspects that work."</p>
        <p>Support Services</p>
        <p>His program, called "Project Zero," targets 7,000 recipients in six areas of the state, promising them whatever services they need to hold a job. Those who can find private jobs must then take them. Those who cannot must perform community service. Those who refuse will find their grants significantly reduced.</p>
        <p>If it sounds familiar, that's because President Clinton proposed more or less the same thing two years ago. Republicans derided the plan as more big government.</p>
        <p>So it's no wonder that Democrats now say the Engler plan validates the principles of mutual responsibility, between society and the poor, that President Clinton has long proclaimed. Like the President, Mr. Engler also hopes to guarantee medical care to the poor once they leave the rolls.</p>
        <p>Many conservatives, while reluctant to throw barbs at Mr. Engler, are not exactly applauding. When Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts called the plan "generous," he did not mean it as a compliment. "I like a sterner approach," he said.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Republican plan in Congress, Project Zero has no time limits: as long as a woman is willing to work, she can receive benefits. It also contains no "family cap," meaning women who have additional children can receive larger grants. "There are a lot of conservatives who think that cutting off welfare is  the only answer," said Senator Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican who added that he is not among them.</p>
        <p>The tepid Republican response underscores the split between the "work" and "illegitimacy" camps. Mr. Engler is among those who believe a welfare overhaul should make recipients work. Members of the "illegitimacy camp" argue that the main goal should be to deter out-of-wedlock births; they would deny benefits to  young unmarried mothers altogether and put strict cutoffs on families, whether they work or not.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Engler was annoyed by the liberal encomiums, the real issue may not be the size of his heart but the size of his wallet. No one, including Mr. Engler himself, knows what his program will cost. The Governor insists it will save money eventually, by moving families off the rolls.</p>
        <p>But there are reasons to be skeptical. Work programs almost always cost more  than sending checks. Poor people need training. Their children need baby-sitters. Their employers often demand subsidies. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the financing of the Republicans' own bill is sufficiently short that fewer than 15 states will meet their employment goals.</p>
        <p>"If you're going to say everyone is going to work, like John is saying, it's  going to be very expensive," said Representative James Talent, a Missouri Republican and a leader of the illegitimacy camp. A more telling experiment may  soon be under way in Wisconsin, which is planning a similar work program that will cover all of its 60,000 recipients.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shalala pointed to the expense as an argument for Federal involvement. If welfare remains an entitlement, Federal spending will rise with need; under block grants, Federal spending remains fixed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Engler wants more state control and less liberal chortling after decades of Federal inaction. "She's out on the fringe left," he said. "I'm in the mainstream. I run a program and she doesn't."</p>
