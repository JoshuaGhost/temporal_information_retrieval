        <p>Mr. Oleksy is now heading a caretaker Government during the two weeks the Constitution allows for a new Prime Minister to be named.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oleksy has firmly denied charges by Poland's security service that he was a spy and that the allegations stem from claims by Government agents working on  behalf of former President Lech Walesa, who was defeated by Aleksander Kwasniewski, also a former Communist, in presidential elections on Nov. 19.</p>
