        <p>A homeless man who was accused of stabbing a 6-year-old Queens girl with a hypodermic needle was ordered yesterday to remain in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
        <p>The decision by Acting Justice Laura E. Drager of State Supreme Court in Manhattan finding the homeless man inconpetent to stand trial followed a report  by two court-appointed psychiatrists who determined earlier this month that the  suspect, Angel Coro, 51, was unable to understand the charges against him or to assist in his own defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coro, who previously escaped from several mental hospitals, was charged  with plunging the needle into the leg of Colete Lopez as she rode with her mother on a Brooklyn-bound F train in Manhattan on Dec. 2.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office did not challenge the findings of the psychiatrists. Mr. Coro, who has been at Bellevue Hospital Center since the  attack, will be held in a secure hospital for patients with criminal records until he is found competent to stand trial or until he has served two-thirds of  the maximum possible sentence.</p>
        <p>Last night, Colete's mother, Magdalena Lopez, who had not been in court for the decision, expressed frustration and unhappiness over what she said was a lack of justice.</p>
        <p>"I'm very disturbed by this," Mrs. Lopez said. "He's not crazy. He knew what  he was doing to my daughter."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lopez and her husband, Sigifredo, have asked a judge in Queens to force  Mr. Coro to be tested for the H.I.V. virus. New York law permits testing only in sexual offenses.</p>
        <p>"This is not justice," Mrs. Lopez said last night. "Why is there so much protection and care for this man? What about my daughter? I don't see justice there."</p>
        <p>By law, mental health officials must now periodically examine Mr. Coro and send reports to the court as to whether he has regained competence. If he was found fit to stand trial, the criminal case against him would resume.</p>
        <p>"Whether it takes a month or one year, it's up to the doctors," said Richard  Siracusa, Mr. Coro's lawyer.</p>
        <p>The maximum time Mr. Coro could spend in a locked unit would be two-thirds of the maximum sentence he would have served if convicted of the charges against him -- criminal possession of a weapon, attempted assault, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument. The weapons charge carries a maximum penalty of seven years, so the longest he could be held is about four and a half years.</p>
        <p>After that, mental health officials would have to seek a civil order to hold  Mr. Coro, which might allow him to be placed in a less secure institution. He walked away from less secure state mental hospitals at least three times before.</p>
        <p>"If he had never escaped," Mrs. Lopez said, "this never would have happened to my daughter."</p>
