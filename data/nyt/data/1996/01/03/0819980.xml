        <p>More than 200 graduate teaching assistants at Yale University have withheld grades from fall semester courses to pressure the university into recognizing their union, the union said yesterday. Yale officials said it would take several days to assess the extent of the grade strike and its effect on undergraduates.</p>
        <p>Yale officials, who warned graduate students in December that taking part in  a grade strike could affect their evaluations or their teaching appointments for the spring semester, said that three teaching assistants so far have been told to appear at disciplinary hearings.</p>
        <p>With Yale students expecting their grades when they return to campus in New  Haven on Jan. 15, a Yale spokesman, Thomas Conroy, said that neither the grade strike nor any other action by graduate students would "in any way change the university's position that they are students, not employees."</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the deadline for submitting grades to the registrar.</p>
        <p>The graduate students have mobilized a campaign in which professors across the country have protested to Yale's president, Richard C. Levin, that teaching  assistants should not be threatened for their organizing efforts.</p>
        <p>Last week, at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association of America, the nation's largest conference of academics, delegates voted to censure Yale for "failing to respect" the right of graduate students to take part in union activities "without fear of reprisals against their academic careers."</p>
        <p>The graduate student union, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization, or G.E.S.O., contends that Yale relies so heavily on graduate students to teach  undergraduate classes and discussion sections that the doctoral candidates have  become part of the university's work force.</p>
        <p>Some 400 graduate students in humanities and social-science departments teach undergraduates in Yale College, in return for stipends that in most cases pay $4,970 a semester; in addition, the great majority do not pay tuition.</p>
        <p>The union maintains that the stipends are inadequate and that the time required to lead expanded class sections because of budget cuts harms both the graduate students' teaching and their research.</p>
        <p>But through the union's five years of efforts to win recognition, including a brief teaching strike in 1991, Yale has insisted that the graduate students are  students who accept teaching responsibilities as part of their apprenticeship. While teaching assistants are represented by faculty unions at 11 public universities, including Rutgers University and the University of Wisconsin, none are unionized at private universities like Yale.</p>
        <p>In a letter to undergraduates at Yale College in December, Dean Richard H. Brodhead pledged that their fall-semester work would be "evaluated and graded -- by ordinary means and on the ordinary timetable, we trust; but by extraordinary  means and on an extraordinary timetable if that proves unavoidable."</p>
        <p>For some professors who teach large lecture courses in which several teaching assistants lead discussion sections, the grade strike poses the problem of evaluating hundreds of students without midterm grades, papers or knowledge of their class participation. Some undergraduates, as well as the union, have questioned the integrity of grades awarded under those circumstances.</p>
        <p>"Grade sheets are going to be turned in by some faculty members, but there is some question about how those grades are derived," said Deborah Chernoff, a spokesman for the Federation of University Employees, whose two locals of staff  employees support the graduate students.</p>
        <p>The graduate students, however, have alienated many undergraduates who see the teaching assistants as students like themselves who are threatening their education.</p>
        <p>"If G.E.S.O. doesn't back down," the Yale Daily News editorialized last month, "it's time for some bitter medicine. Perhaps it's time for Yale to stop tolerating G.E.S.O. with polite disdain and finally eliminated the self-styled teaching assistants' union."</p>
