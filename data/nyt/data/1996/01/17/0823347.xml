        <p>Jeff Tarango was grumbling at the chair umpire again while his good friend Jim Courier watched impassively from the other side of the net. But on this Grand Slam occasion, there would be no coming to a boil. All Tarango would do during his narrow, four-set loss in the second round of the Australian Open today was simmer, complaining about a line call here, asking a sarcastic question there and glowering in Courier's direction after a winning drop shot.</p>
        <p>Coming from another player, such behavior might not have been noticed. Coming from Tarango, the man who walked out of Wimbledon last year and questioned umpire Bruno Rebeuh's integrity, everybody noticed.</p>
        <p>When you become a bit of a marked man, people are a little bit rougher on you, no question," Courier said after the 7-5, 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 6-3 victory that  earned him a third-round rendezvous with the Australian Todd Woodbridge.</p>
        <p>"I think if the umpire would take control of the match and make things plain  right away, it would put less tension on two friends," Tarango said. "But the person they chose today, I don't know if he was ready for that."</p>
        <p>Courier has been Tarango's friend since they were in their early teens. He attended and spoke at Tarango's wedding in France in 1994. He has trained with him often and was a source of counsel in the wake of the Wimbledon incident that made Tarango a tabloid staple and an infamous part of tennis lore.</p>
        <p>But despite Courier's support, Tarango, who is on probation with the ATP Tour until March and barred from next year's Wimbledon, did not hesitate to plead his own case with Australian chair umpire Wayne McKewen. At 4-5 and deuce in the second set, he argued long and hard about a serve he thought should have been called an ace.</p>
        <p>After Courier had dropped his racket at 1-1 in the third set, Tarango approached the net and asked McKewen, "Am I allowed to throw my racket?" Shortly after that, Courier missed a shot and shouted what sounded like a four-letter word. When McKewen didn't react, Tarango threw up his hands and yelled, "One more time."</p>
        <p>On the ensuing changeover, the supervisor Ken Farrar, the man who defaulted John McEnroe from the 1991 Australian Open, made an appearance on court while Tarango was treated for a blister and spoke with McKewen and Tarango.</p>
        <p>"I just asked Farrar if he was hearing the same things I was hearing," Tarango said.</p>
        <p>Farrar was not, but there would be no further incidents.</p>
        <p>"Jeff has always been a unique character," said Courier, insisting that he harbored no grudge. "It's a shame he doesn't really get any credit or justice for the tennis he plays because it is overshadowed by what has happened, and that's too bad."</p>
        <p>Monica Seles, the No. 1 women's seed, did lots of good things on court in her straightforward 6-1, 6-1 victory over Katerina Studenikova of Slovakia in the second round. Seles said she was bothered only slightly by her strained right groin. Other women to win today included No. 6-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, No. 7 Iva Majoli of Croatia, No. 9 Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States and her countrywoman Chanda Rubin, seeded 13th.</p>
        <p>In men's second-round action, Stefan Edberg, the former world No. 1 playing in his final Australian Open, made an early exit, losing in five sets to Jean-Phillippe Fleurian of France. Two seeded players were beaten. Patrick McEnroe rallied to upset No. 14 Andrei Medvedev, 0-6, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2. Karol  Kucera of Slovakia overwhelmed No. 9 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0. No. 15 Todd Martin of the United States held off Richey Reneberg in four sets. The most impressive performance came from No. 5 Michael Chang, who trounced Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Chang said he had discussed playing Davis Cup for the first time since 1990 with the American captain, Tom Gullikson, who could certainly use him. Sampras already has opted out of the first-round match against Mexico in La Costa, Calif., from Feb. 9-11. The team must be announced by Jan. 30.</p>
