        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani intensified his criticism of Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget today, telling state legislators that its deep cuts would create pain for New York City residents and fiscal problems for city government.</p>
        <p>In testimony before a joint legislative budget committee, Mr. Giuliani said that the Governor's budget would provide the city as little as $150 million in savings through cuts to health and welfare programs, far less than the $955 million Mr. Pataki had projected and even less than estimates produced by the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani intensified his criticism of Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget today, telling state legislators that its deep cuts would create pain for New York City residents and fiscal problems for city government.</p>
        <p>In testimony before a joint legislative budget committee, Mr. Giuliani said that the Governor's budget would provide the city as little as $150 million in savings through cuts to health and welfare programs, far less than the $955 million Mr. Pataki had projected and even less than estimates produced by the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.</p>
        <p>The Mayor, who says he needs $675 million in savings from the state to help  balance next year's city budget, said that Mr. Pataki's spending plan could force the city to reduce already pared-back city services.</p>
        <p>Noting that Mr. Pataki's budget calls for 25 percent reductions in some block grants for mental health and health care, Mr. Giuliani said, "At 25 percent, we  are going to be faced with a choice of either hurting people or taking money out of other programs."</p>
        <p>The comments, Mr. Giuliani's most detailed yet on the Pataki plan, contrasted vividly with his testimony before the same committee last year, when the Mayor not only endorsed many of Mr. Pataki's proposed budget cuts but also recommended that some of them be larger.</p>
        <p>While infusing his testimony with praise for Mr. Pataki's overall goals to shrink government, rein in health-care spending and cut taxes, Mr. Giuliani, who, like Mr. Pataki is a Republican, expressed many of the same concerns about  the Governor's plan that Democrats have.</p>
        <p>He said the state was shortchanging the city on school aid, giving it 34 percent of state education spending even though the city has 37 percent of the state's students. He said Mr. Pataki's proposal to reduce cash grants to welfare recipients would "ravage" assistance to the truly needy.</p>
        <p>And while generally supporting the Governor's proposal to create block grants that would cover many social programs, he said he was concerned that the plan would proceed too quickly and was being used to mask deep cuts to those programs.</p>
        <p>City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat and frequent Giuliani rival, said of the Mayor's comments: "His spin is more complimentary to the Governor than mine, but we're essentially coming down in the same place. This is an important  change. It is a less ideological view of the realities of governing."</p>
        <p>Today's testimony seemed to open a new chapter in Mr. Giuliani's constantly evolving relationship with Mr. Pataki. That relationship hit a low point in 1994 when Mr. Giuliani endorsed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo over Mr. Pataki, but improved somewhat in 1995 when the Mayor supported Mr. Pataki's budget even as it cut spending for the city. Today, Mr. Giuliani, who is up for re-election in 1997, seemed to be searching for a middle ground from which he could applaud Mr. Pataki's philosophical positions while attacking the substance of his plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he changed his message this year because the city had already made deep reductions in social programs that had helped the state, which shares in the costs of those programs, to save money. Asking the city to make even deeper cuts in those programs would be unfair, he said.</p>
        <p>And he suggested that sharp state budget cuts could enervate the city's economy. "It is important to understand that the city is an economic engine for  both the state and the nation," he said.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Pataki said they had not heard many of Mr. Giuliani's concerns before today. They played down his criticisms, noting that he continued to praise the broad themes underlying Mr. Pataki's budget.</p>
        <p>"Clearly he has the same goals we do, which is to reduce government spending  and provide services at a lower cost," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's director of communications. But she added, "This is not a situation where we have unlimited funds."</p>
        <p>Other Republican state officials said that they thought Mr. Giuliani's comments today could damage his relations with the Governor. "The Governor won't be a happy camper," said one Republican official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Hevesi, who called today for a delay in a scheduled cut in state income taxes, Mr. Giuliani said he supported further tax reductions. Indeed, he  called on the Legislature to allow the city to eliminate its 4 percent sales tax on clothing costing less than $500. Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly has proposed a similar plan for the rest of the state.</p>
        <p>Though the proposal could reduce city revenues by $300 million a year, Mr. Giuliani said the increase in retail trade caused by the tax cut would more than offset the loss.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani began his Albany trip by visiting the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and Mr. Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan. The Mayor and  Mr. Silver clashed often last year and have barely spoken since February.</p>
        <p>But today's meeting marked a continuing rapprochement between the two men, who appeared before reporters after their 10-minute session sitting side-by-side on a green leather couch in Mr. Silver's office.</p>
        <p>In a signal that he may join forces with Assembly Democrats to fight many of  Mr. Pataki's cuts, Mr. Giuliani said he would continue to meet with Mr. Silver on the budget for weeks to come.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani did not meet with Mr. Pataki, who was in New York City today.</p>
