        <p>Bulls 117, Hornets 93</p>
        <p>Shaking off the distraction of a somber homecoming, Michael Jordan scored 27  points last night and helped lead the decisive run in the Chicago Bulls' 117-93  victory over the Hornets in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Jordan, playing about 120 miles from where a man is on trial for the July 1993 slaying of his father, added 5 assists and 5 rebounds before sitting out the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The 34-minute performance by Jordan, who grew up in the state and starred at the University of North Carolina, helped Chicago improve its National Basketball Association-leading record to 27-3, a mark that also represents the best 30-game start in the Bulls' history.</p>
        <p>"He's disappointed, obviously, that this has to occur and it has to be a public issue," Bulls Coach Phil Jackson said afterward of Jordan. "But it is depressing. You could see he was in a bit of a down mood about it, and rightly so."</p>
        <p>The Hornets had planned on using Scott Burrell, their defensive stopper, to guard Jordan. But Burrell dislocated his right shoulder last weekend and was placed on the injured list Wednesday. That left the task to Glen Rice and Kendall Gill, who were no match for Jordan.</p>
        <p>There were 16 lead changes and four ties before Chicago took control with a 19-6 run bridging the end of the first half and the start of the second. Jordan had 7 points in the surge.</p>
        <p>Timberwolves 98, Suns 93</p>
        <p>Tom Gugliotta hit a 19-footer from the corner late in the game, bringing Minnesota from behind for the final time, and the Timberwolves won at Phoenix for the first time in their seven-year existence.</p>
        <p>Gugliotta, who scored 19 points, got his final basket with 2:39 to play, a jumper that gave the Wolves a 91-90 lead.</p>
        <p>Bullets 112, Mavericks 100</p>
        <p>Juwan Howard scored 18 of his season-high 27 points in the second half as Washington dealt struggling Dallas its eighth straight road loss. Howard also had eight rebounds.</p>
        <p>Jim Jackson led Dallas with a season-high 33 points and George McCloud had 21. Kings 126, Nuggets 96</p>
        <p>Mitch Richmond scored 41 points and the Sacramento Kings had season highs in  points and margin of victory in its victory over visiting Denver.</p>
        <p>SuperSonics 84, Heat 81</p>
        <p>At Miami, Gary Payton came up with a crucial jump ball and then made three free throws in the fourth quarter as Seattle won its seventh straight game. Shawn Kemp led the Sonics with 21 points.</p>
        <p>Hawks 104, Raptors 101</p>
        <p>Mookie Blaylock scored 8 of his 26 points in overtime, after Steve Smith forced the extra period with a 3-pointer, as host Atlanta snapped a three-game losing streak by edging Toronto.</p>
