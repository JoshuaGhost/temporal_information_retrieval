        <p>DONALD R. WALLIS drinks 20 to 30 cups of tea a day. These are not ordinary teas; they are virtually unknown outside China. He said that in 1994 he sipped the entire world's supply of the highest-grade dragon well green tea from Zhejiang province in central China.</p>
        <p>"It was wonderful," Mr. Wallis mused as he carefully warmed a Chinese gaiwan  cup, which is like a tiny teapot, by pouring into it bottled water heated to near boiling.</p>
        <p>He brews the tea in a tasting room at Jadebrook, a small private teahouse in San Francisco's Nob Hill neighborhood. Jadebrook is the headquarters of the American Tea Masters Association, a private group of fewer than 100 tea lovers,  which Mr. Wallis founded in 1994 to help tea farmers in China grow connoisseur-grade tea, some of which hasn't existed for 20 years.</p>
        <p>The group sells its members 421 varieties of green, red, yellow, white, oolong, puerh (pronounced POO-air) and specialty teas with added ingredients like orange spice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallis, the headmaster of the group, works with Roy Fong, a Chinese tea expert here, who helps bring the hand-picked high-grade teas of China to the United States. Mr. Fong, a native of Hong Kong who owns a traditional Chinese teahouse here, visits growers in China two or three times a year. Mr. Fong is responsible for buying the association's tea and for making sure it is processed to the specifications of the board of masters. "Without Roy the organization could not exist," Mr. Wallis said. "We certainly have the largest stock in the world of connoisseur-quality tea. What we are trying to do is share an art. And  art is not cheap."</p>
        <p>Voting members of the Tea Masters Association pay $2,000 a year for dues and  research, plus thousands more to buy new teas. (Members pay from $150 to $2,500  a pound.) A second tier of nonvoting members pay $150 a year and receive a 20-percent discount on the teas. Dues help pay the tea growers for additional labor and assure that tea shipments arrive here within days after processing. Nonmembers can purchased tea from a catalogue.</p>
        <p>The difference between high-grade tea and what is available at the local tea  store, Mr. Wallis said as he dropped dried leaves of a priceless Lotus Heart green tea into his cup, is best revealed in a side-by-side comparison. His tea is perfectly uniform. There are no stems, just sculptured leaves. The scent before and after the tea is infused is delicate. The taste is rich, with a fullness that even a novice can appreciate. The aftertaste lingers like that of  a wine.</p>
        <p>Such connoisseur-grade tea is not available in retail outlets. "There's so little of it, you can't market it to the masses," Mr. Wallis explained. For example, a 100-acre field of plants may produce only one to four pounds of Lotus Heart a year.</p>
        <p>The homeland of the camellia sinensis tea plant, from which all tea is made,  is China, where it has grown for nearly 5,000 years. Historically, Chinese families cultivated the finest teas, known as "tribute" teas, passing knowledge  down for generations.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years, tractors and gas-powered shears have replaced human hands in the fields. For the Lotus Heart green tea, Mr. Fong has growers in China hand-pick the tea buds on the exact day of new growth -- usually at the end of March -- in the early-morning hours before the heat of the day. Before processing, growers remove all the stems and bruised leaves, then hand-fire the  leaves in a wok. Only a small fraction of what is picked actually makes it into  the final sorting.</p>
        <p>The level of tea quality "is just phenomenal," said Diana Rosen, the editor of Tea Talk, a quarterly newsletter published in Sausalito, Calif.</p>
        <p>The American Tea Masters Association is also host for an annual conference here to teach new growing techniques. For membership information: (415) 775-4227.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Wallis, success is measured by the tea-filled jelly-type jars piling  up in the crawl space above the ceiling at Jadebrook. He closed his eyes and lifted the cup to his lips to savor the Lotus Heart. "You can't communicate this experience," he said quietly. "It's indescribable."</p>
