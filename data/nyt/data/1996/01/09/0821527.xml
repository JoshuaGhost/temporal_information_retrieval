        <p>Close, but no free Cadillac. The Potamkin Auto Center -- which promised to pick up the tab for every car it leased between Christmas and New Year's if more than four inches of fresh snow fell in Central Park between 10 A.M. and 10 P.M.  yesterday -- appeared to squeak by last night as the blizzard let up after leaving behind just over three inches within the designated time frame.</p>
        <p>Scores of hopeful leaseholders who spent a day monitoring weather reports and crossing their fingers had to accept the fact that they would have to pay for their new cars after all. The Blizzard of '96 had deposited the bulk of its snow before 10 A.M.</p>
        <p>I was watching the weather reports when the cable went off," said Michael Wang, who was checking to see if he would have to keep up on the payments for his new Ford Explorer.</p>
        <p>For a time, Mr. Wang's odds looked very good indeed as a record snowstorm blanketed the region. But the snowfall was considerably lighter yesterday than it had been overnight.</p>
        <p>At 10 A.M., there was 17.3 inches of snow on the ground in Central Park, according to Gary Conte, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. By 10 P.M., when the snow had tapered off, there was 20.6 inches. The net snowfall  for the 12-hour period was only 3.3 inches.</p>
