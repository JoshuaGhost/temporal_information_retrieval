        <p>The possible merger was one of several cost-cutting suggestions in an internal Board of Trade study reported in the latest Crain's Chicago Business, a weekly magazine. Mr. Arbor and many of the large trading houses that belong to both exchanges favor such a move, but there is also strong opposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arbor said that he had recently discussed the idea informally with Jack  Sandner, chairman of the Merc, but that the discussions were not as serious as those they had two years ago. The Merc has suffered a sharp decline in trading volumes on its crucial currency exchanges, with overall volume off 29 percent last year from 1994's record levels.</p>
