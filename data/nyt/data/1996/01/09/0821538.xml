        <p>Secretary of Defense William J. Perry said today that the United States would be willing to include American troops in a peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights if they were requested.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, said later that a multinational force on the strategic plateau on the Israeli-Syrian border would help reassure  Israelis, but he emphasized, "We have never asked for American soldiers to defend our lives."</p>
        <p>The comments of Mr. Perry and Mr. Peres generally adhered to previously stated positions, but they stirred new interest because of the negotiations between Syria and Israel that began near Washington late last month. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher will visit Damascus and Jerusalem to assess the talks' progress.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Perry nor Mr. Peres indicated whether an American presence on the Golan had been discussed with Syria.</p>
        <p>The central issue between Syria and Israel is the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war. One question is how to assure the security of Israel if it withdraws from territory that offers both a geographic buffer and an observation post.</p>
        <p>The notion of having American forces take over Golan monitoring functions has often been raised. The position of the United States has been that it would consider a request, while Israel has said it would not object to an American force to monitor a peace, though it would not want the Americans to serve as a military tripwire or as a first line of defense.</p>
        <p>Speaking with reporters after his meeting with Prime Minister Peres, Mr. Perry said, "If the peace agreement between Israel and Syria is reached, which we hope and believe will happen, and if that calls for a peace monitoring force  in the Golan Heights, and if both Israel and Syria request the U.S. to participate in that, we are prepared to do that."</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres, speaking later at a luncheon, compared what the Americans might do in the Golan to their role in the monitoring force that has been in the Sinai Desert since 1979. There, troops from the United States, Fiji and Colombia maintain a 2,400-strong peacekeeping force, while American civilians man monitoring stations.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the Israeli press has speculated about the possibility of a  formal alliance between the United States and Israel, an idea that reportedly interests Mr. Peres, but is resisted by the Israeli military, which fears that it would lose its freedom of action. There was no indication whether this was discussed during Mr. Perry's visit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres, who launched a new initiative toward Syria immediately on taking office in November, after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, expressed satisfaction with the start of talks with Syria. He said he thought President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had "reached this conclusion that the best bet for the future is a contractual peace with Israel, and that is also our position."</p>
