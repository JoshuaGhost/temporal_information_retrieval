        <p>An article in The Living Section on Wednesday reported concerns about the sale of impure olive oil in the United States. But the article considerably overstated the extent of the problem, to a degree that undercuts its basic premise.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration tested 73 olive oils produced or distributed by companies based in the United States. Of those, one was found to  be adulterated with other oils. In other words, 98 percent of the oils were pure, compared with the 4 percent reported in the article. In 1994, the F.D.A. tested 72 oils and again found only one impure, not 29 percent, as the article said. (The F.D.A does not disclose names of the brands it tests.)</p>
