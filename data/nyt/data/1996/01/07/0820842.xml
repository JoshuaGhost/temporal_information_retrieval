        <p>A little more than a year ago the Republicans were campaigning against Democratic gridlock on Congress, and we all know what happened: the Democrats got creamed.</p>
        <p>Now we are beginning to hear the Democrats campaign against Republican deadlock, specifically, Gingrichian deadlock, in Congress. Will Republicans be hoist on their own petard? Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the likely Democratic nominee in the United States Senate race this year, is itching to light the fuse.</p>
        <p>These weeks of deadlock define the race for the U.S. Senate," Mr. Torricelli said in an interview. It will be the contention of the Democratic campaign that the Zimmer record is indistinguishable from Newt Gingrich and that nothing demonstrates this better than the Zimmer votes to keep the Government closed.</p>
        <p>"Zimmer," of course, is Representative Richard A. Zimmer of Hunterdon County, the presumptive Republican nominee to go against Mr. Torricelli. His response is a variant of "not so fast."</p>
        <p>"If we shut down the Government," Mr. Zimmer began, and then cheerfully corrected himself, "I mean, if Clinton shuts down the Government to no useful end, there will be long-term problems for us. But if this strategy to bring about the first balanced budget in generations succeeds, I think it will be worth the short-term cost."</p>
        <p>In other words, if the Republicans can deliver the balanced budget, voters won't care in November that the passport office shut down over Christmas.</p>
        <p>So who holds the best hand? Looked at from Mr. Zimmer's point of view, the idea of a little pain now for a lot of gain later is appealing, and the alternative appalling: when the big banks cut their interest rates two weeks ago, they did so on the expectation that the Zimmers in Congress would deliver on the balanced budget and therefore reduce the Government's need to borrow.</p>
        <p>If the poll numbers are to be believed, the Republican stonewalling is unpopular, even frightening for many voters; yet if the same pollsters ask, "Do  you think Congress and the President should reach a balanced budget?" they unhesitatingly say yes.</p>
        <p>One reason for this popular unhappiness with a policy that is popular on paper is that many people are uncomfortable when they are told by Mr. Zimmer and his party to put their values to a test: You want a balanced budget? Then what are you prepared to cut?</p>
        <p>The two sides of that coin are likely to be the two sides of the Torricelli-Zimmer contest this year, and New Jerseyans should consider themselves lucky to be the arbiters of such a classic social science debate.</p>
        <p>With the memory of the shutdown fading, Mr. Torricelli will point out that Mr. Zimmer has voted consistently with his quixotic leader, Speaker Gingrich, to end entitlements to Medicaid and welfare, thereby cutting the growth in Federal  funds to New Jersey. He will say that making Medicare patients pay at least $800 a year in higher premiums by the end of 2002 (when the budget is supposed to be  balanced) is cruel, when many Medicare recipients subsist on Social Security stipends of less than $14,000 per year.  And that just as the cuts in Federal subsidies will hurt the poorest and benefit the richest, so Mr. Gingrich's changes in environmental rules will chiefly benefit investors.</p>
        <p>And he will point out that as the budget impasse dragged on, not even Senator Bob Dole of Kansas was willing to continue the standoff, while Mr. Gingrich, and Mr. Zimmer, stuck to their guns. "There is this ideological extremism that has gained disproportionate control of the Federal Government," Mr. Torricelli said. "It is so extreme, even Bob Dole won't go along with it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer conceded that some members of the House Republican Caucus were uncomfortable with the prolonged shutdown, but not many.  "Regardless of some differences in conference, there is close to unanimous support for hanging tough," he said. Translation: It's too late to turn back.</p>
        <p>In November, New Jerseyans will be able to choose which version they like best.</p>
