        <p>The tail stairwell door on a Trans World Airlines passenger jet dropped open  during flight late Tuesday, but a crew member secured with a rope was able to close the hatch without incident before the plane landed safely.</p>
        <p>The incident began when a cockpit light indicated that the door under the tail of the Boeing 727 had opened while the plane was 15 miles southwest of the  San Antonio International Airport, said an airport spokeswoman, Linda Wasserman. The plane was carrying 74 passengers and crew members.</p>
        <p>Crew members on the flight from St. Louis to San Antonio found that the stairway had dropped about two feet, Ms. Wasserman said. But a closed door in a  wall between the stairway and the passenger compartment prevented the loss of air pressure in the cabin, she said.</p>
        <p>"There was no debris flying around in the cabin or passengers being at risk because of sudden depressurization," Ms. Wasserman said.</p>
        <p>The pilot circled and brought the plane down to about 3,000 feet so the cabin could be safely depressurized and the closed door opened.</p>
        <p>An unidentified cockpit crew member was then able to reach the door, Ms. Wasserman said.</p>
        <p>"They did use a rope and tied it around this individual," she said. "Just for safety, they kept a hold of him by this rope, and he did reach out and pull this door closed."</p>
        <p>A captain, co-pilot and navigator were in the cockpit, but it was not immediately known who pulled the door shut.</p>
