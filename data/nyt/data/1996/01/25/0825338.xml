        <p>Hoping to unsnag a bill to overhaul communications laws, senior Republican senators are discussing proposals to modify a controversial provision for television broadcasters and take it up in a separate bill at some point in the future.</p>
        <p>At issue is a provision that would reserve a valuable parcel of the nation's  airwaves for advanced digital television services like high-definition television.</p>
        <p>Critics of the provision, including Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have said it amounts to a multibillion-dollar "giveaway" to broadcasters.</p>
        <p>Government economists have estimated that the licenses would be worth up to $70 billion if they were auctioned off to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>The bill has passed both the House and the Senate but has been under fire by  Senator Dole as well as some House Republicans who complained that it was too regulatory.</p>
        <p>Many lawmakers do not want to pick a huge fight with the broadcasting industry, which has already announced plans to begin a big public relations offensive on the issue.</p>
        <p>Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said he thought the issues raised by Senator Dole could be best addressed in a separate bill.</p>
        <p>"I envision doing some sort of grand spectrum bill that would address plans for the next 15 years," Mr. Pressler said in an interview. Senator Pressler said the communications bill did not currently provide broadcasters with a "giveaway" as Senator Dole has charged, but Mr. Pressler has himself favored the idea of auctioning off the television frequencies rather than reserving them exclusively for broadcasters at no charge.</p>
        <p>Several senior Republican staff members said that lawmakers had discussed dealing with the issue in a separate bill, which amounts to deferring any action on the digital television issues and would probably strengthen the ability of broadcasters to make their case to individual lawmakers.</p>
        <p>One Congressional aide said the idea was supported by Senator Trent Lott, the majority whip, who has been a strong supporter of the broadcasting industry thus far and has received a sympathetic hearing from top aides to Senator Dole.</p>
        <p>But others aides said that lawmakers had reached no decision.</p>
