        <p>Fire and Housing Authority officials said yesterday that they had determined  what went wrong in efforts to protect New York City's housing projects from a terrifying series of stairwell fires and would complete work in the most susceptible buildings this week.</p>
        <p>Fire Commissioner Howard Safir said inspectors had determined that improper application of a fire retardant paint allowed flames to race six flights up a stairwell at the Jefferson Houses in East Harlem on Dec. 22.</p>
        <p>The retardant had successfully stopped nine other stairwell fires since mid-November, he said, and work has gone ahead to protect buildings deemed the most vulnerable -- those that are 30 years or older and those that have 10 or more floors.</p>
        <p>The Housing Authority has already applied the retardant in 580 of those 592 buildings, as well as more than 200 newer or shorter buildings, according to Jack Deacy, a Housing Authority spokesman.</p>
        <p>"We think that we're in control now," Ruben Franco, chairman of the Housing Authority, said yesterday at a City Hall news conference. "We're on top of this, and we're moving very aggressively and very effectively."</p>
        <p>Scores of stairwell fires were set by arsonists in the last 18 months, officials said, including one that killed two people in Harlem in November. The  fires were characterized by the horrifying speed with which flames raced up the  stairwells. Fire officials concluded that the fires fed on heavy layers of oil-based paint that had built up on the stairwell walls.</p>
        <p>Housing officials turned to the fire-retardant paint as an answer, but the blaze at the Jefferson Houses raised questions about its effectiveness and how well it was being applied. Mr. Safir said the retardant failed to adhere to the  surface because the stairwell walls had not been properly sanded. Since that fire, Mr. Safir has ordered 30 fire inspectors to monitor the work to see that it is properly done.</p>
        <p>"But most importantly here, the fact is these buildings do not start fires by themselves," Mr. Safir said. "These are arson fires that are started by criminals who intend to start dangerous fires."</p>
        <p>Mr. Franco said the Housing Authority had hired hundreds of teen-agers to help police officers patrol inside buildings and to look for debris in stairwells that could be used to start fires. Fire officials noted that three people had been arrested for setting fires in housing projects since early December.</p>
        <p>It will cost the city about $10 million to paint the stairwells in about 2,400 of its 2,900 public housing buildings. The remaining 500 buildings are low-rise structures with fewer than six floors and are considered less at risk.</p>
        <p>Responding to an article in The Daily News saying that the Housing Authority  continued to use oil-based paint until last January despite warnings from fire officials, Mr. Franco said: "At the time, obviously, we thought we were moving as fast as we could move."</p>
