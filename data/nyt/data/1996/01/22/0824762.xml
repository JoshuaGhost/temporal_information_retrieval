        <p>TOM G. KESSINGER is leaving Haverford College for the second time. Mr. Kessinger, who graduated from the liberal arts college in Haverford, Pa., in 1965, and came back as its president in 1988, announced last week that he will step down on July 1 to become president of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.</p>
        <p>The trust, a small foundation supported by the Aga Khan and based in Geneva,  focuses its support on the buildings, landscapes and environs in the Moslem world from the Philippines to Morocco.</p>
        <p>It looks for opportunities to train and retrain architects and planners involved in the physical environment through scholarships and symposiums," Mr. Kessinger said from Chantilly, France, the other day. "It also identifies historical buildings in the inner cities of the Moslem world that can be restored, and it gives awards to innovative modern architects."</p>
        <p>A specialist on South Asia, Mr. Kessinger, who was with the Ford Foundation in Jakarta and New Delhi from 1979 to 1988, said, "I have spent half my working  life overseas, in Indonesia, India, Guyana, South America and Pakistan. I have always said that I would never leave Haverford for any other institution of higher learning But I have also said that if one more opportunity came along to  work and travel internationally and work on important issues, I would take it."</p>
