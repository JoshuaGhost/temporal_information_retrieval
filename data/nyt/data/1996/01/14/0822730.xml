        <p>Gulliver Preparatory School in Miami, disqualified from a cross-country event because of the team's high-cut briefs, yesterday lost its appeal to get its third-place finish restored.</p>
        <p>The executive board of the Florida High School Activities Association upheld  the race officials' decision that Gulliver's form-fitting briefs, now standard in elite running, were too short at the state's cross-country championship on Nov. 18 in Jacksonville.</p>
        <p>I'm disappointed," said Karen Callaway, who coaches the team. "I was hoping the executive board would be fair-minded."</p>
        <p>The National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations permits the tight briefs for girls, but stipulates that "abbreviated" (French or high-cut) shorts and similar apparel are not permitted unless worn underneath a  standard running short.</p>
        <p>Individual states are permitted to interpret the clause. The briefs are worn  by New York's top girls' cross-country teams, in Saratoga Springs and Shenendehowa, which were co-ranked No. 1 in the country last fall. However, the  Red Bank Catholic girls wore traditional shorts while winning in New Jersey, where the briefs are prohibited.</p>
        <p>Callaway wasn't sure what Gulliver would be wearing for Florida's coming track season. "I don't know what we want to do," she said, adding half-jokingly, "long hoop skirts, maybe."</p>
