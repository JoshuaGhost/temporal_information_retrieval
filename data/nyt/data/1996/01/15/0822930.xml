        <p>United States civilian contractors are to begin training Bosnian Muslim soldiers in the next 60 days, Clinton Administration officials say, as the first step toward insuring they can defend themselves after NATO peacekeepers leave.</p>
        <p>Last week, Bosnian officials in Sarajevo agreed to an Administration plan that calls for the Muslim-Croat federation, which that controls about half of Bosnia, to hire retired American military officers to teach basic soldiering skills and more advanced tactics. United States forces would not be involved in  the training.</p>
        <p>The Republican-controlled Senate voted last month to endorse the Bosnia peacekeeping mission on the condition that the Administration lead an international effort to equip and train the Bosnian Government's army to the same level of the Bosnian Serbs, who control the other half of Bosnia and outgun the numerically superior Muslim forces.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, has argued for American military support for the Muslims since the question of American involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina was raised several years ago.</p>
        <p>But the Balkan peace accord, reached in Dayton, Ohio, in November and signed  last month, imposes a 90-day embargo, ending in mid-March, on the supply of any  military equipment to any side in the Bosnian conflict and a 180-day embargo on  supplying heavy weapons.</p>
        <p>"In terms of providing heavy weapons, we're more than five months from being  able to do that," Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in an interview. "But  I would expect the training to start during this three-month period. We have no  reason to wait."</p>
        <p>Under the plan, Bosnian Muslim troops would be trained in Bosnia and perhaps  a NATO country like Turkey, Pentagon officials said. The Turkish Foreign Ministry announced last month that it would sign a defense treaty with Bosnia soon.</p>
        <p>Islamic countries would be expected to pay for most of the training and equipment, said Mr. Perry, who discussed the proposal with Saudi officials in Riyadh earlier this month. One senior Pentagon official said the training would  cost no more than $100 million and the equipment about $400 million, depending on whether the Bosnian army received American-made weapons or Eastern European equipment similar to that used by the former Yugoslav army.</p>
        <p>But Western European officials fear that arming the Muslims will undermine the impartiality of the NATO peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and their efforts to  promote arms control in the Balkans. The Dayton agreement calls for the former combatants to reduce their weapons.</p>
        <p>European officials also worry that this approach could encourage the Muslims  to fight to regain control over all of Bosnia. This in turn could prompt a strategic alliance between Croatia and Serbia, the region's military powers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry, in an interview last Thursday, expressed confidence that the Administration's approach would allay European worries. "I think they understand at this stage we don't want an arms race, and we will work this in the context of an arms-control agreement," Mr. Perry said.</p>
        <p>One of the companies the Pentagon has recommended that the Muslim-Croat federation hire for the training is Military Professional Resources Inc., of Alexandria, Va., which employs many retired American military officers. The company has been training officers of the Croatian Army.</p>
        <p>"We're ready to see what's up, but we don't know what the requirement is yet," said Harry E. Soyster, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency who is vice president of international operations for Military Professional Resources.</p>
        <p>In theory, striking a military balance between the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Serb forces would protect the Muslims from further Serb aggression after NATO troops pull out, as scheduled later this year.</p>
        <p>Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat troops are allied in a tenuous federation, and although Administration efforts are addressed at the federation, Washington  is clearly intent on building up the Muslim forces.</p>
        <p>At last week's meeting in Sarajevo, American officials were encouraged when the Bosnian Muslims and Croats agreed to end their parallel military commands and form an integrated chain of command and a single ministry of defense.</p>
        <p>"Our focus is on the Bosnian Muslims, but we're trying to encourage better integration between the two," said a senior Pentagon official.</p>
        <p>The Administration's plan, which identified the Bosnian military's strengths  and weaknesses and the priorities for training and equipment, was presented to Bosnian officials last week in Sarajevo by Pentagon and State Department officials.</p>
        <p>The plan relies on a classified 200-page study the Pentagon commissioned from the Institute for Defense Analyses, a Government-financed research center.</p>
        <p>The study concluded that the Bosnian Government's top military leaders are sound, but that its forces sorely need training at the small-unit level in operational tactics, command and control, and logistics.</p>
        <p>The immediate task, Pentagon officials say, is to begin training Bosnian officers and build a new corps of sergeants, the glue of any army. These Bosnian troops would in turn instruct their units. Equipping the Bosnian forces would happen after the embargo expired.</p>
        <p>"The whole concept is to train the trainers instead of us training each unit," said James Pardew, a former head of Bosnia policy at the Pentagon who is  now leading an interagency group, operating out of the State Department, to organize the arm-and-equip effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pardew's team also met last week with Croatian and Serbian leaders to ease their suspicions. "We laid out a program to Zagreb and Belgrade that's going to be done, period," Mr. Pardew said in an interview. "And it will be transparent."</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry said the training will cover basic soldiering skills and then specific training on weapons, like antitank guns and armored personnel carriers, when they arrive.</p>
        <p>Richard Perle, a former Reagan Administration official who advised the Muslims at the Dayton peace talks, said in an interview that the Muslim forces need a range of equipment, from tanks and air-defense weapons to more mundane things like trucks and helicopters.</p>
        <p>"It's a pretty daunting task," Mr. Perle said.</p>
