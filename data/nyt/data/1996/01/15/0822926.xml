        <p>Vietnam has announced plans to move at least 50,000 people from a remote northern province to make way for a big hydroelectric power project.</p>
        <p>Rapid economic growth in Vietnam has increased the demand for power and worsened power shortages.</p>
        <p>Plans for the power plant, which were announced on Thursday, expect it to be completed by 2007 and to produce 17 billion kilowatt-hours of power a year. That would make it over three times the size of the country's largest existing hydropower station, at the Hoa Binh dam, near Hanoi.</p>
        <p>The reservoir that is to be created would swamp thousands of acres of forest  and farmland and could affect up to 110,000 people in Son La and the upstream Lai Chau Province.</p>
        <p>A planning official in Son La province said economic development zones are to be built about 300 miles away for those displaced from the mountainous region, many of whom are members of minority ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>A senior official from the province was quoted in the daily Vietnam News recently as saying that Son La was "prepared to suffer losses in the area destined to become a man-made reservoir for the sake of a brighter life in the future."</p>
        <p>But some Western economists have deep reservations about the impact on the lives of local inhabitants.</p>
