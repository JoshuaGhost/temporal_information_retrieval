        <p>After four days of intense talks that ended this morning in Honolulu, the United States and North Korea came close to agreeing on a joint mission to recover the remains of thousands of American servicemen killed in the Korean War, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>The talks were the first of their kind since the war ended in 1953, and the fact that they took place at all was seen as a significant diplomatic development.</p>
        <p>Though the United States and North Korea first began discussing the recovery and repatriation of the lost soldiers in 1987, the meeting in Hawaii was the first in which they seriously discussed a joint effort.</p>
        <p>Such missions have proved useful in establishing contacts with old enemies, as they did with Vietnam. But these talks did not lead to an immediate breakthrough in relations between the United States and North Korea, or open significant channels of dialogue with North Korea, perhaps the most politically  isolated nation.</p>
        <p>The talks in Hawaii ended after two senior military officers in the seven-man North Korean delegation opposed a joint mission.</p>
        <p>Despite the frustrating conclusion, "the door's open" for talks in the future, said a member of the American delegation, Alan Liotta, deputy director for prisoners of war and troops missing in action for the Defense Department.</p>
        <p>More than 8,100 United States and United Nations personnel, most of them American, are listed as missing from the Korean conflict, four times the number  of American soldiers still unaccounted for in Vietnam. Most are believed to have been buried in graves at prison camps.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans have so far delivered 208 sets of remains across the demilitarized zone separating their country from South Korea. Of those, 46 were  returned between 1990 and 1992, for which the United States paid $897,000 to reimburse the cost of search and recovery; 162 were returned in 1993 and 1994.</p>
        <p>But in all, only five set of remains have been positively identified, in part because of the techniques used to recover them, in part because a fire destroyed records in a St. Louis document depository 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans submitted a bill for $4 million for the remains returned in 1993 and 1994. Last month, they accepted a two-year-old offer to go to Hawaii to discuss the compensation and to visit the Army Central Identification Laboratory.</p>
        <p>During the four days of talks, the United States delegation, led by James Wold, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, offered the North Korean delegation $1 million to settle the bill they submitted. Kim Byong Hong, who heads the foreign policy division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led the North Korean delegation.</p>
        <p>In the end nothing was settled -- including the most important issue, the offer of a joint mission.</p>
        <p>The political and financial issues were linked, diplomats said: the United States would have agreed to some kind of monetary settlement had the North Koreans agreed to a joint mission to recover the missing.</p>
        <p>Disputes within the North Korean delegation over when to begin such a mission were a stumbling block, American officials said. So were tensions between North  Korean Foreign Ministry officials, who seemed to favor some agreement, and military officials, who proved more skeptical.</p>
        <p>North Korea has recently appeared to want to improve relations with its old rivals -- the United States, South Korea and Japan -- and to reduce its isolation.</p>
        <p>Self-interest would be a strong motive because North Korea faces widespread famine, with food shortages worsened by cataclysmic floods and crop failures last summer.</p>
        <p>Diplomats from the United States, South Korea and Japan are to meet next week in Hawaii to discuss security issues relating to North Korea, including concerns over its political stability and the possibility of providing the North with food or other aid.</p>
        <p>No one ever signed a peace treaty to end the Korean war, only an armistice. Technically the North Koreans are still at war with the United States and South  Korea.</p>
        <p>North Korea has sought direct talks with the United States on a peace treaty, but Washington maintains that such talks must be held between the two Koreas, which have shared only hatred and a divided people since the war began in 1950.</p>
