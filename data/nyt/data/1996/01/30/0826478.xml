        <p>In the culmination of a long-discussed trade, the Boston Red Sox got the relief pitcher they wanted yesterday. The Minnesota Twins, at the same time, got an outfielder for the kind of contract that owners love.</p>
        <p>The pitcher, Heathcliff Slocumb, whom the Red Sox coveted for their closing role, was the pivotal player in a six-player trade with Philadelphia. Slocumb, a right-hander who was born 29 years ago in Queens, replaces Rick Aguilera, whom the Red Sox let go as a free agent.</p>
        <p>Roberto Kelly, not long ago a regular member of the Yankees' outfield, is the outfielder the Twins signed. Kelly, a free agent after having earned $10 million in the previous three years, including $3,733,333 last year, accepted a  minor league contract that provides a $525,000 salary if he plays for the Twins. He can earn an additional $100,000 if he has 500 appearances at the plate.</p>
        <p>Since starting for the Yankees for four seasons, Kelly has played for four other teams over the last three years. Splitting last season between Montreal and Los Angeles, he hit .278 and drove in 57 runs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees signed Gerald Perry to a minor league contract. The 35-year-old Perry, who played for Manager Joe Torre in St. Louis, has a chance of winning a  job with the Yankees as a left-handed-hitting pinch-hitter and backup first baseman. Perry, whom the Cardinals released on Aug. 26 after he had hit .165 in  65 games, holds the club pinch-hitting record with 70 hits.</p>
        <p>The Phillies traded Slocumb with two minor leaguers, outfielder Rick Holifield and pitcher Larry Wimberly, for outfieldeps Lee Tinsley and Glenn Murray and reliever Ken Ryan, who had but could not keep the closing job for the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Slocumb surprisingly became the Phillies' closer last season, finishing with  32 saves, though just 4 in the last six weeks. Tinsley, the Red Sox starting center fielder for much of last season, will provide the Phillies with protection for center field in case Lenny Dykstra incurs physical problems again -- back and knee ailments limited him to 62 games last year -- or they decide to move Dykstra to left field.</p>
        <p>On the same day that the Twins signed Kelly, an outfielder whom they made a free agent last month by not tendering him a contract joined the Oakland Athletics. The outfielder, Pedro Munoz, who had a $725,000 salary last year, agreed to $595,000 and a possible $175,000 in bonuses.</p>
        <p>And in keeping with the game of musical players, a former Oakland pitcher, Steve Ontiveros, moved to the California Angels, accepting a pay cut, from $965,000 to $225,000. He can augment his salary with $725,000 in bonuses.</p>
