        <p>The nonpartisan commission that organizes the Presidential and Vice-Presidential debates recommended today that St. Louis, St. Petersburg, Fla., San Diego and Hartford be the sites for four debates this fall.</p>
        <p>The Commission on Presidential Debates, which sponsored and produced the debates in 1988 and 1992, has scheduled the first debate between the Presidential candidates on Sept. 25, at Washington University in St. Louis, where the opening debate was held four years ago.</p>
        <p>There would be a debate between the Vice-Presidential candidates at the Civic Center in Hartford on Oct. 2, and Presidential debates at the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg on Oct. 9 and at the University of San Diego on Oct. 16.</p>
        <p>The commission has proposed that each debate last 90 minutes. Under its plan, the first debate and the Vice-Presidential debate would have the candidates seated with a moderator who would pose questions. The second debate would have members of the audience pose questions in a town-meeting format. The final debate would have both candidates standing behind lecterns and receiving questions from a moderator.</p>
        <p>The format and schedule are subject to approval by the Presidential candidates. In 1992, the four debates ended up being squeezed into eight days because haggling among the candidates led to delays. As a result, two sites were changed to accommodate their schedules.</p>
        <p>The announcement today ended nine months of competition for the events from as many as 45 cities.</p>
        <p>"The lobbying was quite intense," Janet H. Brown, the executive director of the commission, said. "There is enormous national and international attention focused on the debates, and therefore the debate sites. These are historic events."</p>
        <p>In Connecticut today, the state's two United States Senators, Christopher Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman, both Democrats, joined other elected officials at  a crowded news conference to tout the victory. "This is a great day for Connecticut," Mr. Dodd, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said.</p>
        <p>Like their competitors, many in Hartford saw the debate as a way to boost the city's image. The state's political leadership pulled out all the stops. Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, asked the other New England governors to send letters supporting Hartford's selection. And Daniel Papermaster, the coordinator of Hartford's campaign, said he was on the phone every day with members of the state Congressional delegation to plot strategy.</p>
        <p>"This was a dog fight," Mr. Papermaster said.</p>
        <p>About 97 million viewers watched the third and final Presidential debate in 1992, making it the largest television audience for a political event, Ms. Brown said. She predicted that this year's events would draw an even larger audience.</p>
