        <p>Prime Minister Lamberto Dini resigned tonight to avoid defeat in a no-confidence vote, leaving Italy facing the possibility of fresh national elections and the near certainty that any Government that follows will not survive for long.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dini's decision, announced in a brief address to Parliament, came after he learned that two splinter groups in the makeshift center-left coalition that  has supported his year-old Government would not vote in his favor: deputies from the Communist Refounding party said they would vote against the Prime Minister and the Greens said they would abstain.</p>
        <p>Without the support of the two groups, Mr. Dini would lack a majority to defeat a motion demanding that he step down. The motion was presented by supporters of Mr. Dini's predecessor and main political rival, Silvio Berlusconi.</p>
        <p>The political turmoil that began in late December, when Mr. Dini offered his  resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, is likely to continue. President  Scalfaro rejected the resignation and asked Mr. Dini to submit his Government's  future to a parliamentary vote.</p>
        <p>Tonight Mr. Dini went to the President's office at the Quirinale Palace to meet Mr. Scalfaro, who had just returned from the memorial service for the former French President, Francois Mitterrand. Mr. Scalfaro "reserved judgment" on accepting the resignation, a formality by which Mr. Dini remains Prime Minister while Mr. Scalfaro begins discussions on resolving the crisis.</p>
        <p>The President will confer with political leaders before deciding whether to ask Mr. Dini or some other party leader to try to form a Cabinet, or to call new elections, which he is trying to avoid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dini's position became untenable after the center-right group in Parliament, led by Mr. Berlusconi, submitted the no-confidence motion. Mr. Berlusconi's backers insist Mr. Dini must resign so talks can begin on whether to force early elections or to allow multilateral discussions on overhauling Italy's Constitution.</p>
        <p>The coalition supporting Mr. Dini put forth a counterproposal, but the Prime  Minister announced his decision after it became clear his backers would lose in  a parliamentary show of hands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi has claimed repeatedly that Mr. Dini's backers have usurped the mandate that Mr. Berlusconi's coalition won in national elections in March of 1994 but lost later that year when a key member of the coalition backed out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dini was appointed at the beginning of 1995 to head a Cabinet of nonpolitical "technicians" whose main task was to enact austerity measures. In October he rescued his fragile Government in a similar no-confidence vote by promising to resign before the year's end, after the 1996 budget had passed Parliament.</p>
        <p>What lies behind the political turmoil is uncertainty about how to devise a system to replace the post-war political old guard, which was toppled by investigations that uncovered endemic graft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi is to go on trial in Milan later this month on charges of corruption. Even as the crisis unfolded, he was forced to issue a statement denying a news report tonight that he was the subject of further investigations  into alleged attempts to derail the work of the investigating magistrates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi welcomed Mr. Dini's departure, saying it paved the way for the two sides to reach a "high and noble accord" on constitutional change. The leader of the right-wing National Alliance party, Gianfranco Fini, who is Mr. Berlusconi's main ally, called Mr. Dini's step "salutary."</p>
        <p>But Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, disagreed, saying Mr. Dini's Government had fostered a "convergence of content" about constitutional change. "Now it is more difficult," he said.</p>
        <p>Many politicians and business leaders said the resignations damaged Italy's credibility just as it assumed the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. Giovanni Agnelli, whose family controls the Fiat industrial group, said on television, "Dini should stay."</p>
