        <p>Sergeant Pitsor, who had worked in the Barstow office for 17 years and was named its 1995 officer of the year, was dismissed on Monday.</p>
        <p>He was arrested on Dec. 10, the day after the woman accused him of driving her 20 miles into the desert and raping her. She said they had met as she walked in the downtown area at night, and he had offered to drive her home. The woman,  who was driven back to Barstow after the assault, identified Sergeant Pitsor by  the name on his badge.</p>
