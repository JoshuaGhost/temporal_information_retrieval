        <p>Mr. Malsin was the son of David Bryant, a New York jeweler who died in 1900,  and Lena Himmelstein Bryant.

        <p>Raphael B. Malsin, who served for more than three decades as a top executive  of the Lane Bryant retail chain founded by his mother, died on Friday at his home in Harrison, N.Y. He was 95.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malsin was the son of David Bryant, a New York jeweler who died in 1900,  and Lena Himmelstein Bryant. It was Mrs. Bryant who, as a widowed seamstress, opened in 1904 the small Manhattan dressmaking business that eventually grew into the Lane Bryant chain. In 1909, Mr. Malsin was adopted by his mother's second husband, Albert Malsin, and took his name.</p>
        <p>In 1938, Mr. Malsin became chief executive of Lane Bryant Inc., and at the time of his mother's death in 1951, the company she founded had become the largest "special-size" chain in the country, catering to women who wear larger sizes. He resigned from his executive post in 1972, but remained on the company  board. By 1980, the company was shaken by bitter policy disputes and litigation  between Mr. Malsin and his half-brother, Arthur Malsin, who had shared in company management. In 1982, the Lane Bryant chain was bought by Limited Inc., which now operates it as a separate subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malsin, known as Ray, graduated in 1921 from Yale University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Interrupting his business career in 1943, he served as an administrator of the Lend-Lease Program in Algeria during World War II. He was a past chairman of the National Retail Merchants Association, president and treasurer of the Hospital for Joint Diseases and a board member at the Harlem School of the Arts and Blythdale Children's Hospital. He was also a benefactor of the Peabody Museum at Yale.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Elaine; by three sons, Steven of Manhattan, Peter of Meriden, N.H., and Scott of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Amy, also of Los Angeles.</p>
