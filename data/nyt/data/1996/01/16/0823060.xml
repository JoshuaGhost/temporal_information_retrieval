        <p>There was a gantlet of girls leading into Gianni Versace's show last night, teen-age girls holding either a sign that said something like "Robbie, You're the Best Forever!" or a parent's hand. The Robbie in question is Robbie Williams, formerly with the British teeny-bop band Take That, and with Oasis, one fan explained, until he was expelled after baring his rump in a pair of trousers with the back cut out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams also wears Versace and asked to attend the show. So, starting at 7 yesterday morning, the fashion insiders arriving for the beginning of Italy's  fall men's-wear collections faced the indignity of having their limousine and taxi doors yanked open by teen-age girls, who would peer inside at them and declare, "Niente."</p>

        <p>There was a gantlet of girls leading into Gianni Versace's show last night, teen-age girls holding either a sign that said something like "Robbie, You're the Best Forever!" or a parent's hand. The Robbie in question is Robbie Williams, formerly with the British teeny-bop band Take That, and with Oasis, one fan explained, until he was expelled after baring his rump in a pair of trousers with the back cut out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams also wears Versace and asked to attend the show. So, starting at 7 yesterday morning, the fashion insiders arriving for the beginning of Italy's  fall men's-wear collections faced the indignity of having their limousine and taxi doors yanked open by teen-age girls, who would peer inside at them and declare, "Niente."</p>
        <p>It should be easy for the men's fashion press, pulling open the doors to Milan's houses, to empathize. Not to say niente (or nothing), perhaps, but "Nothing much has changed." What the Italian houses seem to be addressing is the unwillingness of men to follow trends. Women's fashion has slowed its rhythm; men's fashion has effectively halted completely.</p>
        <p>If the Robbie Williams fanatics recall early Beatles fans (it took 65 police  officers to get Mr. Williams out of the Versace boutique on Saturday), the clothes here thus far recall early Beatles attire. Iceberg, which showed tonight, sent out invitations with its own version of the "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely  Hearts Club Band" album. The first show of the season, Alberto Biani for New York Industry, opened with "Please Please Me" on the soundtrack and Carnaby jackets and Beatle boots on the models. "Free as a Bird" is on heavy rotation on the music-television channel.</p>
        <p>The only problem is that the recent mod revival has made these Carnaby Street clothes achingly familiar. During the Beatles' reign, men's fashion belonged to  the British. And what has been best so far here looks decidedly British: the pared-down tailoring of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gianfranco Ferre and Romeo Gigli. Vivienne Westwood, whose timing has never been anything short of impeccable, showed her men's wear for the first time on a runway here, and John Richmond and Katharine Hamnett are also on the Milan schedule this week.</p>
        <p>Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce distributed program notes to their show with a shared sentiment: "Fashion for mere fashion's sake is dead, the fashion of bad taste, the pursuit for the eccentric to the detriment of whatever esthetic concept." They went on to declare "dead" three terms once dear to their vocabulary: trend, avant-garde and modern.</p>
        <p>Their solution was collegiate simplicity. Props in the past have been cigarettes in ebony holders or diamond chokers. This season, models wore horn-rimmed glasses and even socks. With tightly fitted jackets and slim pants,  they wore V-neck sweaters, white shirts and thin ties. Lush camel coats, lean pin-stripe trousers, thick hand-knit sweaters and the crispest white shirts kept the entire collection aligned with the touchstones of good taste. In a city where Giorgio Armani seemed to be the concept's last designer defender, Mr. Dolce and Mr. Gabbana capitulated beautifully.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferre has often in the past been his own worst enemy, letting sexy styling and greased-up skin upstage his impeccable men's collections. Fall is always his forte, and Mr. Ferre resisted past missteps, like excess fabric and detailing, and showed trim and tidy clothes that are highly likely to outlive their buyers. Mr. Ferre said that he studied sportswear and uniforms this season to transfer the technology of movement to the clothes and that "now even Shetlands and tweeds include an elastomer yarn allowing fluency and snugness." The results were impressive. Many of the models dug their pockets deep into the  suits, and even the harshest-looking Harris tweeds gave gently at the shoulders. Even the leather seemed to stretch to fit, and without any overt effort at sexiness, it was Mr. Ferre's sexiest collection yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gigli denied himself a few indulgences, as well, like fringe, ornate Indian fabrics and over-ornamented clothes. The result was a masculine, clean collection in which every look seemed to work, from the rich velvets with an underlying iridescence to the dandyish frock coats to the lean trousers that sometimes slit to cover the shoes. Almost every suit was shown with a thin tie and a vest, and his three-piece velvet suits seemed destined to replace the geriatric tuxedo. The collection lost none of Mr. Gigli's romance, but instead of feeling like Edwardian dressing from a world of the past, the clothes looked  like the artistic-minded modern man's suit of choice.</p>
        <p>If Robbie Williams is still in the mood to shock his fans, there is plenty in the lines that Mr. Versace showed for the younger set to do just that. For the first time in his men's collection, Istante had a strong direction and stood on  its own, and Versus was full of clothes for Sid Not-So-Vicious sorts, whose legs are as skinny as the average arm and whose chests are as thick as thighs.</p>
        <p>It was the Gianni Versace main collection that lacked direction. Mr. Versace's last show pared the pieces into their simplest permutations. This season, it seemed he wanted to put some fun back into the line but was not sure  how. For the women's collection he had added prints and vibrant colors; the men's collection was mostly a bleak brown. There were some optical star prints on jackets, but they lacked conviction. The jolt of energy he usually provides for men's fashion was just not there.</p>
        <p>The jolt was left to Ms. Westwood, who dazed those who have never experienced her women's collections.</p>
        <p>Yet, in the midst of a spate of English costume dramas -- from the BBC production of "Pride and Predjudice" to "Carrington," "Sense and Sensibility" and "Restoration" (with the number of kilts in her collection, "Rob Roy" is also worth mentioning) -- Ms. Westwood's vision hardly seemed shocking. The show was  a precise translation of her women's-wear runways, sometimes natty, sometimes batty.</p>
        <p>It could be argued that her women's collections are more masculine. Clearly,  her muse is her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, who works with her and accompanied  her down the runway, garbed as a foppish Louis XVI to her Marie Antoinette. For  those with royal delusions, or dandyish ones, Ms. Westwood did not disappoint. This collection seemed truer to her treatise that "mass production is anathema to art" than even her last women's collection did.</p>
        <p>The most amazing pieces were jewel-encrusted naked bodies on jackets, with red ruby gashes of blood dripping as if they had just survived a joust. Yet, like Jean-Paul Gaultier's imaginative efforts, what will end up in stores are the Savile Row-style suits. Her program reminded that "Savile Row has always been my inspiration and tailoring the base of every collection from the time in  1970 when Malcom McLaren and I produced our first garments, four Teddy boy suits to sell in our shop 'Let It Rock.' "</p>
        <p>In a city where Anglophilia has reached a new high, Ms. Westwood is the queen of the Teddy boys.</p>
