        <p>We're just agreeing to an injunction that he will not violate any laws," Mr. Pohlson said. Under the agreement, Mr. Raabe will not admit to wrongdoing and will not be barred from activities in the financial markets, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Orange County declared bankruptcy on Dec. 6, 1994, after sustaining investment losses of more than $1.6 billion.</p>
