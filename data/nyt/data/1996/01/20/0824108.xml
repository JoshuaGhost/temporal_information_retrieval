        <p>Grain prices surged yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade in another sign of vibrant export demand and on a forecast that farmers would plant fewer acres  of corn than expected.</p>
        <p>On other commodity markets, oil and natural gas prices declined, while gold rose. The Commodity Research Bureau's cash index of 17 commodity futures rose 0.04, to 240.63.</p>

        <p>Grain prices surged yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade in another sign of vibrant export demand and on a forecast that farmers would plant fewer acres  of corn than expected.</p>
        <p>On other commodity markets, oil and natural gas prices declined, while gold rose. The Commodity Research Bureau's cash index of 17 commodity futures rose 0.04, to 240.63.</p>
        <p>Global stocks of corn and wheat are at 20-year lows, and a Government report  showing another strong week of export demand for United States grains helped drive up prices.</p>
        <p>Bitter cold weather across the Midwest was also supportive of prices because the battering winds could damage dormant wheat plants and because livestock must be fed more grain to keep warm.</p>
        <p>"There is support from the weather and the good export number," said Ron Kucha of O'Connor &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department said United States wheat export sales in the week  that ended Thursday were at a year-high 1.5 million metric tons, with corn sales at 1.8 million metric tons, a 23 percent increase from the previous week. Soybean sales were also up sharply.</p>
        <p>"Corn is the driving force," said Steve Bruce of E.D.&amp; F. Man International.  "It's still a demand-led game in here."</p>
        <p>A surprising prediction of corn acreage to be planted this spring from the Memphis-based analytical concern, the Sparks Companies, also buoyed prices of contracts in distant months.</p>
        <p>Sparks projected that farmers would plant 79.6 million acres, which was below trade expectations of up to 81 million acres.</p>
        <p>Traders said the projection for planted acres of soybeans of 62 million acres, the same as last year, was insufficient to rebuild drained supplies.</p>
