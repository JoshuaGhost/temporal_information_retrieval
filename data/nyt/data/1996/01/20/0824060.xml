        <p>A group of townsmen who consider themselves the law ride out to Jane Withersteen's ranch and lasso a young man she has befriended. Just in time, in answer to her whispered prayer, a black-hatted stranger appears on the horizon.  He saves Jane's friend and sends the others back to town merely by mentioning his name, Lassiter.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, that stranger is Ed Harris, who has always seemed an utterly contemporary actor. But in the rousing, old-fashioned Western "Riders of the Purple Sage," he may be the most quietly intense and effective gunslinger since  Clint Eastwood. This literate made-for-television film, based on the 1912 novel  by Zane Grey, shows that the myths of the Old West are still potent.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, Grey helped popularize those myths, and "Riders" has all of them. Lassiter is the loner, driven by a dark secret, who stands against a corrupt town. He is laconic but eloquent, a seeker of justice yet capable of killing. And as played coolly by Mr. Harris, he is even more intriguing because he is not matinee-idol handsome. His hair hangs to his shoulders, but when he takes off that hat he is conspicuously balding.</p>
        <p>Jane, played with controlled ferocity by Amy Madigan, is the heroine determined to hang onto the ranch her father left her. Though she wears dresses  with lace collars and has pre-Raphaelite curls, she is tough enough to be the hero's equal. She knows more about horses than he does and can keep up with him  as they ride through the beautiful, brutal landscape of red canyons. (Filmed in  Utah, "Riders" has the rich, spacious look of a John Ford classic.)</p>
        <p>The reason behind Jane's conflict with the town is murkier than it needs to be, though. In Grey's novel, Jane and the other townspeople are identified as Mormons; the church leaders consider Jane, who befriends outsiders, to be a dangerous rebel. In the film, Jane often refers to "my people" and to various pastors and deacons, but the word Mormon is never mentioned. Although that may spare the feelings of contemporary Mormons, it makes the town seem in the thrall of some bizarre, unknown cult.</p>
        <p>What remains clear, though, is that religion has become an excuse for a nasty exercise of power. The sinister Deacon Tull (Norbert Weisser) lectures Jane from the pulpit, ordering her to marry or risk damnation. In fact, the congregation wants her to marry one of their own so they can control her money. To intimidate her, they encourage the theft of half her cattle, and she hires Lassiter to help save what's left.</p>
        <p>"The men of my creed have been driven in hate, up until they've become cruel," she tells Lassiter, "but we women pray for the time when their hearts will soften."</p>
        <p>"Begging your pardon, Ma'am," he says, "that time will never come."</p>
        <p>"Oh, it will," she answers softly, setting up a battle between their souls that is at least as pressing as the struggle to save her cattle. Such elemental  conflicts, in the guise of an adventure story, give Westerns their power. A subplot, in which Jane's young friend Bern (Henry Thomas) shoots and then rescues a pretty young rider named Bess (Robin Tunney) is less effective. The characters pale beside Jane and Lassiter.</p>
        <p>"Riders of the Purple Sage," produced by Mr. Harris, Ms. Madigan and David A. Rosemont, was directed by Charles Haid, who also directed the compelling first episode of "Murder One." In "Riders" he knows just when to use a close-up of Lassiter's heated stare and when to burst into kinetic action. Everyone involved is smart enough not to mess up a good thing. "Riders of the Purple Sage" doesn't reinvent the Western; it gives the genre a terrific jolt of energy.</p>
