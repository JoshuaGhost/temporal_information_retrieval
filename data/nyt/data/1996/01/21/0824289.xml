        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yes, arts education is both growing and changing in New York ["Playing to Tomorrow's Audience," Dec. 24]. And regardless how these outreach efforts evolve, the city's major arts institutions are sending young people a message about the values of the community in which they are growing up. This message is  especially critical in light of the debates over budget-slashing that are dominating national politics</p>
        <p>At New York City Ballet, we invest nearly half a million dollars each year on educational programs that incorporate ballet into curriculum areas, including language arts, social studies and writing. Elements of our yearlong curriculum include lessons plans for teachers, in-school lecture demonstrations and movement workshop, and a free performance by the ballet company at the New York  State Theater.</p>
        <p>We believe these programs are an important part of our obligation to the community we serve. Our commitment to this purpose is informed by the knowledge  that the arts are an invaluable part of every child's education, not only because of self-enrichment but also because they define an essential part of who we as a society choose to be.</p>
        <p>PETER MARTINS New York</p>
