        <p>THE Warner Theater may be most famous for the singer who didn't play there.</p>

        <p>THE Warner Theater may be most famous for the singer who didn't play there.</p>
        <p>"I got a call from the William Morris Agency around February of 1957," recalled George Hamid, who owned the Steel Pier and several theaters in Atlantic City. "They said, 'We have an act so big we can't put it on Steel Pier.' I laughed and said, 'There's no such act.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamid refused the offer. "I said, 'We'd go for a Perry, a Pat or a Frank, but who's going to go for a guy with a crazy name like Elvis?' "</p>
        <p>And so Elvis Presley never played Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>"But next year," Mr. Hamid added, "when they called me about Ricky Nelson, I  said yes."</p>
        <p>It's been a long time since Ricky Nelson, Ella Fitzgerald and Mel Torme performed at the Warner Theater. Today the Warner is a forlorn reminder of better times. Its last tenants, who moved out last month, were a Boardwalk fast-food restaurant and karaoke bar.</p>
        <p>And now Caesars Atlantic City, a subsidiary of the ITT Corporation, wants to  remove what is left and build a 620-room hotel tower, with restaurants and a 20,000-square-foot convention ballroom. Whether the once-splendid Spanish Mediterranean facade can be salvaged will depend on the efforts of preservationists and the willingness of Caesars to help.</p>
        <p>Built in 1929 at the then-extravagant cost of $2.7 million, the 4,300-seat Warner was Atlantic City's grandest movie palace and most romantic showroom. In 1958 it was sold to Mr. Hamid, who had been booking concerts and stage shows  there. As a condition of the sale, he had to drop the Warner name, and he called the theater the Warren because that was the least expensive way of changing the  marquee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamid later transformed the theater into the Boardwalk Bowl. "Snooks Pearlstein and all the old-time pros used to play pool there," recalled a local  historian, Sidney Trusty, who staged bowling competitions there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamid sold the Boardwalk Bowl to the Howard Johnson's Boardwalk Regency Hotel, a block away, in 1970. The property was later acquired by Caesars when the casino company bought the hotel in 1977. Now Caesars has received preliminary approval to build the tower, and no provisions have been made for what is left of the theater.</p>
        <p>"Nobody expected it to go away, so nobody did anything about it," said Anthony Kutschera, a founder of the Atlantic City Historical Society. "This is all that's left from the time when going to a theater was an experience."</p>
        <p>When Florence Miller, the feisty executive director of the Atlantic City Art  Center, heard that the Warner might be demolished, she called Caesars executives and pleaded for a stay of execution. On Jan. 8, which happened to be  her 79th birthday, Al Cade, a Caesars vice president, told her, in her words, that "whatever could be done to save it will be done."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Miller took this to mean that Caesars would either incorporate the Warner into its expansion plans or donate the facade to the Atlantic City Historical Museum. But through Valarie McGonigal, the Caesars spokeswoman, Mr. Cade said the company had not determined the facade's fate and would not for several weeks.</p>
        <p>Because the theater is not on the National Register of Historic Places, and therefore not subject to Federal restrictions that protect structures of historic value, no plans were made to save its auditorium, which Caesars demolished to build a parking garage.</p>
        <p>Another friend of the Warner, Steven Izenour, an partner in the Philadelphia  architectural firm Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates, says Caesars should be thanked for saving the facade as long as it did. A co-author of "Learning From Las Vegas" (M.I.T. Press, 1972), Mr. Izenour researched Boardwalk architecture.</p>
        <p>"Everything on the Boardwalk was considered disposable and replaceable when it was originally constructed," he said in an interview. "Survival is worth something. Something is gained by the fact that these few pieces are all that's  left. The Warner Theater's is such a beautiful, handsome facade that even as run-down as it is, you can't help thinking that famous people played there."</p>
