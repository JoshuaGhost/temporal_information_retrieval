        <p>It was gratifying to see Herb McCracken, my uncle, in your issue ("Football's Best-Kept Secret," by Tom Friend). Not only was he proud of inventing the football huddle, but I know he was also proud of his election, in 1973, to the National Football Foundation's Hall of Fame. In 1988, he received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award from the American Football Coaches Association.</p>
        <p>Thanks for remembering his accomplishments in this way.</p>
