        <p>A key shareholder syndicate in Italy's troubled Olivetti group, led by the chairman, Carlo De Benedetti, broke up yesterday -- a significant move in a country where such pacts control many top companies. The syndicate, controlled by Mr. De Benedetti's CIR S.p.A. holding group, had just under 20 percent of Olivetti's stock, and its demise could weaken the chairman's position at the company, which he has controlled for nearly two decades.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for CIR said the dissolution was requested because the syndicate's stake in Olivetti had been seriously devalued by the company's huge  public stock offering last September. The group included Italy's top merchant bank, Mediobanca; Italy's largest private bank, Instituto Bancario San Paolo di  Torino, and the tire maker Pirelli S.p.A. Olivetti's stock slumped for a third consecutive day yesterday, falling 1.4 percent, to 914.2 lire (57 cents).</p>
