        <p>After having "paired and nested," many members of the baby boom generation are now in the process of trading up to single-family homes, public policy analysts say.</p>
        <p>"They are trading up to bigger homes and to communities where they will want  to stay for quite a while," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Policy at Rutgers University.</p>

        <p>After having "paired and nested," many members of the baby boom generation are now in the process of trading up to single-family homes, public policy analysts say.</p>
        <p>"They are trading up to bigger homes and to communities where they will want  to stay for quite a while," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Policy at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>Indeed, more than two-thirds of new single-family homes are now sold to trade-up buyers, said Michael Carliner, economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
        <p>That trend, experts say, will help shape the nation's housing market through  the 1990's and past the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>The baby boomers began flooding the real estate market in the 1970's, spurring a total of 2.4 million housing starts in 1972 -- the peak year since World War II. After a late 1980's slump in the market, housing starts in 1991 fell to a postwar low of 1.01 million units.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carliner estimated there were 1.4 million housing starts in 1995.</p>
        <p>While the boom of the 1970's was largely spurred by the construction of multifamily dwellings, with the Government providing subsidies for such construction, the current turnaround was prompted by the maturation of the baby boomers.</p>
        <p>At least through the rest of this decade, said H. James Brown, director of the Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, "trade-up households will  dominate the market and housing construction."</p>
        <p>Regional economies, of course, will give particular shape to local housing markets. The prevalence of trade-up buyers in the Northeast and California, where economic recovery has been slower, will be more evident than in communities like Denver, Phoenix or Las Vegas, Nev., where new jobs attract younger, first-time buyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes of Rutgers noted that in 1994, 88 percent of the units constructed in New Jersey were single-family -- up from an average of 61 percent since 1960. "And that's typical of the suburban ring" of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, he said.</p>
