        <p>Some 25 million people -- nearly half the population of France or twice the population of Pennsylvania -- visited New York City last year for business or pleasure or both. From Omaha, Osaka and everywhere else, they came in record numbers, bringing joy to innkeepers and maitre d's, to theaters and merchants, and more than $1 billion to the collectors of city and state taxes.</p>
        <p>But all is not well.</p>
        <p>While New York's travel business has been improving, its share of the nation's total has shrunk because its share of international travelers is down.  Since favorable exchange rates encourage foreign tourists to spend more generously than the home-grown variety, they are especially important. But in the past three years, New York City's share of their patronage has shrunk to 2 percent from 2.2 percent. The slippage represents 2 million visitors who did not visit, and 10,000 local jobs not created.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers may be full of themselves, but newer attractions like Las Vegas and the Disney playgrounds in Florida are better self-promoters. It is time the  Big Apple polished its sales pitch.</p>
        <p>All told, visitors from out of town -- tourists, business people and conventioneers -- constitute one of the city's largest industries. They spend in excess of $10 billion a year, create 130,000 jobs and net the city one-half billion dollars in taxes.</p>
        <p>The current expansion of this lucrative trade is fed by factors that cut its  cost -- lower air fares, lower hotel taxes and, for most foreigners, those advantageous exchange rates -- as well as by the awareness that crime has decreased dramatically.</p>
        <p>The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau is just one of several organizations luring out-of-towners, and there lies a problem -- the lack of concerted effort. The bureau is supported by City Hall and some 1,200 business members. The state does its own travel promotion, but its "I</p>
        <p>N Y" campaign has been cut back.</p>
        <p>There are also two private groups. New York '95 is an aggressive collection of hotel, restaurant and travel interests that started as the host committee for the 1992 Democratic National Convention. The Association for a Better New York is a well-established organization with roots in real estate.</p>
        <p>There is no estimate of how much is spent to promote New York, because there  are so many separate components and their spending fluctuates. But the biggest is the bureau, which spends about $7 million a year, including $3 million supplied by City Hall. The Miami visitors bureau spends twice as much, and the Las Vegas bureau spends even more.</p>
        <p>New York '95 has a plan to make itself permanent, rather than an ad hoc committee with no regular sources of funding. That should help. The promotion of the travel business also needs more help from the city. But, in terms of commitment, there is an embarrassment of freeloaders, including some upscale establishments that profit from out-of-town visitors without contributing a nickel. They reflect a cocky belief that New York is so glamorous that it needs  no promotion. With that attitude, the city's share will continue to shrink.</p>
