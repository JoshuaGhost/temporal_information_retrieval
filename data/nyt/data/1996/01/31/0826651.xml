        <p>After keeping the corporate and investment worlds off balance through more than two decades of unceasing acquisitions and divestitures, Lord Hanson, the chairman of the British-American conglomerate Hanson P.L.C., pulled off his biggest surprise today, saying that he would break the company into four publicly traded parts.</p>
        <p>The plan means the dismantling of a corporate empire that during the 1980's became legendary for its ability to sniff out undervalued companies in basic industries, whip them into shape and sell them for hefty profits. And it continues a trend of sprawling companies' breaking themselves into their component businesses in search of higher profits and stock prices in the tougher climate of the 1990's.</p>

        <p>After keeping the corporate and investment worlds off balance through more than two decades of unceasing acquisitions and divestitures, Lord Hanson, the chairman of the British-American conglomerate Hanson P.L.C., pulled off his biggest surprise today, saying that he would break the company into four publicly traded parts.</p>
        <p>The plan means the dismantling of a corporate empire that during the 1980's became legendary for its ability to sniff out undervalued companies in basic industries, whip them into shape and sell them for hefty profits. And it continues a trend of sprawling companies' breaking themselves into their component businesses in search of higher profits and stock prices in the tougher climate of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Hanson's decision was motivated in part by the poor performance of its stock, which has languished over the last year as markets in New York and London boomed. In London today, Hanson's shares closed at L2.115, up 7 pence. And in New York, Hanson's American depository receipts ended the day unchanged at $15.75, with more than 13.5 million units traded, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. [Market Place, page D8.]</p>
        <p>But the move was also portrayed by company executives as the logical culmination of Hanson's strategy over the last few years. Hanson has gradually been reducing the scope of its businesses through spinoffs and divestitures, while investing more heavily in its four core businesses. Last year, it spun off its smaller holdings in the United States to shareholders, and it recently put nearly $3 billion of other properties up for sale.</p>
        <p>After the breakup process is completed, probably later this year, the core businesses -- chemicals, tobacco, energy and building materials -- will be stand-alone entities with their own managements and stock-market listings.</p>
        <p>Calling the move "exciting and radical," Lord Hanson said in a statement that the strategy had been adopted "to create even greater management and growth opportunities," and to "improve the operations, profitability and long-term prospects of these four major businesses."</p>
        <p>The announcement today came five months after the death of Lord White, Lord Hanson's partner in building the company -- sometimes by means of all-out hostile takeovers -- into a trans-Atlantic agglomeration of distinctly unglamorous but reasonably profitable businesses. And it comes a year before Lord Hanson's announced retirement. The sure touch shown by the two men in buying and selling companies during the 1980's became less apparent as they settled down to operate them in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Only the building-materials group will retain the Hanson name, and Lord Hanson, 74, will serve as its chairman until his retirement.</p>
        <p>The other groups will be run by current Hanson managers, with Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, becoming chairman of the tobacco and energy businesses, and William M. Landuyt, head of Hanson's operations in the United States, running the chemicals company.</p>
        <p>"People had assumed that Lord Hanson would want to leave his mark on the corporate world in the form of a massive company with interests in diverse areas, and clearly that's not going to happen," said Charles Pick, an analyst at Panmure Gordon &amp; Company in London. "It's a tribute to him that he's more wedded to improving shareholder value than maintaining a large corporate entity with his name on it."</p>
        <p>Other big companies, including AT&amp;T and ITT, have pursued similar breakup strategies of late, acknowledging that they had become too far-flung to manage effectively. Their strategies have generally been well received by investors.</p>
        <p>But it remains unclear just how much Hanson's plan will benefit shareholders, who have enjoyed relatively high dividend payments in recent years but have seen the stock miss bull markets on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Hanson said it was still working on details of the plan, including the tax implications. But it said that it intended to spin off the businesses to existing shareholders in the form of new shares and that the distribution of those shares was expected to be tax-free to stockholders in both the United States and Britain.</p>
        <p>It said its preliminary estimate was that one-time corporate taxes and other  costs associated with the transaction would be "containable," but it declined to estimate those costs. Hanson said it would allocate corporate debt among the four companies on an appropriate basis, but did not provide details.</p>
        <p>Although the company said that dividends for 1996 should be in line with last year's, analysts expected that investors would be nervous about the plan's long-term effects on their dividends, another area in which the announcement was vague.</p>
        <p>Analysts said they still did not have enough information to value the new companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonham is recognized as the primary architect of the spinoff strategy. Since taking over as chief executive nearly four years ago, he has gradually replaced the swashbuckling style of Lords White and Hanson with a much more focused approach on fewer, but potentially more profitable, businesses.</p>
        <p>He said in a statement that he was "extremely enthusiastic" about the plan, but warned that it was an exercise on a huge scale and that "such radical restructuring is inevitably complex."</p>
        <p>The chemicals businesses, most of which are in the United States, include Quantum Chemicals and SCM. They had estimated sales last year of L2.02 billion,  or about $3.25 billion at the exchange rate on Sept. 30, 1995, when the fiscal year ended, and were the biggest contributors to Hanson's bottom line, with operating profit of L591 million, or $892 million. The shares of the chemicals business are to be listed in New York.</p>
        <p>Imperial Tobacco, which had sales of L3.57 billion, about $5.7 billion. The company, Britain's second-largest cigarette maker, is to list its shares in London.</p>
        <p>The energy business, with sales last year of L3.5 billion -- about $5.6 billion -- is made up primarily of electric utilities in Britain and coal mines  in the United States and Australia. Its shares are to be listed in London and New York.</p>
        <p>The building-materials business encompasses concrete and brick producers in Britain, asphalt companies in the United States, and a crane company that operates in the United States and Europe. It had sales last year of L2.3 billion, or $3.7 billion, and will be listed in London and New York.</p>
