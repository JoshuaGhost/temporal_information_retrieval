        <p>The company said today that the reductions totaled about $10 million a year.  Fund fees were lowered by as much as 45 percent, and the average fee was cut 18  percent, the company said.</p>
        <p>Annual advisory fees for the Windsor Fund, for example, will be cut 20 percent, to a maximum of 20.9 basis points, or $2.09 per $1,000 invested, the company said.</p>
        <p>Vanguard, already considered the industry's low-cost company, said it was reducing fees in the wake of a "substantial climb" in fund assets last year. The last time Vanguard cut its investment advisory fees was in 1993.</p>
