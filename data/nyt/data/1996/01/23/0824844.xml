        <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said today that a 1995 ruling did not expand its regulatory powers to include certain derivative contracts.</p>
        <p>Mary L. Schapiro, the commission's chairwoman, wrote to two Representatives about the agency's $2.25 million fine against a German conglomerate, Metallgesellschaft A.G., last July, and argued that it represented no change from the agency's 1989 decree that swaps contracts were exempt from agency scrutiny.</p>

        <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said today that a 1995 ruling did not expand its regulatory powers to include certain derivative contracts.</p>
        <p>Mary L. Schapiro, the commission's chairwoman, wrote to two Representatives about the agency's $2.25 million fine against a German conglomerate, Metallgesellschaft A.G., last July, and argued that it represented no change from the agency's 1989 decree that swaps contracts were exempt from agency scrutiny.</p>
        <p>The ruling had ignited concern on Wall Street, and by two key members of Congress, Representative Pat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, and Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., a Republican from Virginia.</p>
        <p>They and Wall Street bankers were concerned that the agency's decision cast a cloud over the legal standing of many of the contracts that make up the $14 trillion derivatives market. They were also concerned that the agency was attempting to take authority over a big, expanding market and would drive up the cost of doing business with extra regulations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schapiro said the agency entered the case because the company's mounting  trading losses "threatened the stability and integrity of the futures markets,"  not because of a desire to expand regulation of derivatives. The company's trading losses contributed to a $1.2 billion loss for the company.</p>
        <p>"The commission did not intend that its order in the MG case change the scope of the term futures contract and, in fact, the order does not do so," she said. "With respect to swaps, the MG action does not, and should not be read to  address those instruments."</p>
        <p>The ruling pleased investors. "The commission's letter will help clear away the cloud of uncertainty left by the MG order," said Mark C. Brickell, managing  director at J. P. Morgan, New York, and a director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. He said that C.F.T.C.'s letter "should make it easier for companies to hedge risk, confident that their contracts will be enforceable."</p>
        <p>Swaps are customized private agreements to exchange streams of payments over  time.</p>
        <p>The C.F.T.C. fined Metallgesellschaft for selling contracts over the counter  that were similar to futures contracts. Since futures are supposed to be sold on an exchange and regulated by the C.F.T.C., the agency ruled the contracts illegal.</p>
