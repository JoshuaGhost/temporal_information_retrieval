        <p>A patient with Alzheimer's disease should stay with the son who wants him to  live, rather than with other relatives who may try to take him to see Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who has attended 26 suicides of ill people, a judge ruled today.</p>
        <p>The son, Chip Klooster, earlier won temporary custody of his 69-year-old father, Gerald Klooster, a retired doctor who has been found mentally incompetent, after he learned that other members of the family had contacted Dr. Kevorkian. The action today by Judge Fred Mulhauser of Emmet County Probate Court continued that order of temporary custody indefinitely.</p>

        <p>A patient with Alzheimer's disease should stay with the son who wants him to  live, rather than with other relatives who may try to take him to see Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who has attended 26 suicides of ill people, a judge ruled today.</p>
        <p>The son, Chip Klooster, earlier won temporary custody of his 69-year-old father, Gerald Klooster, a retired doctor who has been found mentally incompetent, after he learned that other members of the family had contacted Dr. Kevorkian. The action today by Judge Fred Mulhauser of Emmet County Probate Court continued that order of temporary custody indefinitely.</p>
        <p>The judge said that if he had ruled otherwise, he believed the other four children of Gerald and Ruth Klooster might not stand up to Mrs. Klooster and keep her from seeking the assistance of Dr. Kevorkian.</p>
        <p>"Ruth Klooster was very close to accomplishing her goal," the judge said, referring to assisted suicide.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, has been present at 26 deaths as part of his crusade for physician-assisted suicide.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Klooster has said that since her husband was found to have Alzheimer's disease six years ago, he occasionally spoke about suicide.</p>
