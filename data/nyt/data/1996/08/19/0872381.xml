        <p>A children's soccer field? Not in my backyard, some Princeton Township residents say. The township wants to buy a 38-acre farm for a youth soccer league, which is losing access to fields at Princeton University because the university now needs them for its own students. The township has lined up $1.8 million in state grants and loans to buy the farm, and an anonymous donor has offered $1 million to get the fields in shape, said Jack Roberts, recreation director for Princeton Township and Borough. But neighbors are worried about noise and crime at the site, as well as bond debt and increased traffic. Tonight they will state their case to the Township Committee, said T. Burnet Fisher, head of the group that opposes the plan.</p>
