        <p>Taking his third-party Presidential campaign to a national veterans convention, Ross Perot said today that both the Democratic and Republican Presidential tickets were so captive to special interests that they could not look after the national interest.</p>
        <p>''They're bought and paid for by these companies who want to take the jobs out of the U.S.A. and take it over to child labor in Thailand, make tennis shoes for $5, pay 22 cents to ship them across the Pacific, sell them to our kids for 150 bucks and they kill one another on the street to get them,'' Mr. Perot said.</p>

        <p>Taking his third-party Presidential campaign to a national veterans convention, Ross Perot said today that both the Democratic and Republican Presidential tickets were so captive to special interests that they could not look after the national interest.</p>
        <p>''They're bought and paid for by these companies who want to take the jobs out of the U.S.A. and take it over to child labor in Thailand, make tennis shoes for $5, pay 22 cents to ship them across the Pacific, sell them to our kids for 150 bucks and they kill one another on the street to get them,'' Mr. Perot said.</p>
        <p>''Is that what you fought for?'' he asked members attending the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>At another point, he lambasted a Defense Department manual authorizing purchases of military equipment from foreign suppliers, arguing that this represented the kind of unpatriotic outrage that neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole was willing to address.</p>
        <p>''Did either of the other two candidates ever bring that little skunk up and hold it by its tail?'' Mr. Perot asked, drawing laughter, shouts of ''No!'' and some applause from the crowd.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Perot nor Vice President Al Gore, who spoke here on Wednesday, drew the kind of sustained cheering that Mr. Dole did in his speech to the V.F.W. earlier this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole, who was severely wounded in World War II, has been endorsed by the group's political action committee.</p>
        <p>The address was Mr. Perot's first public appearance since he accepted the nomination on Sunday of the Reform Party, whose activities have been bankrolled almost entirely by Mr. Perot.</p>
        <p>He said of his party volunteers today: ''They built it. It belongs to them, and there's not a penny of special interest money in it.''</p>
        <p>Much of Mr. Perot's 28-minute speech, which was followed by a quick exit from the Commonwealth Convention Center that left no time for him to press flesh with veterans or take questions from reporters, involved an attack on the two major parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot said it was absurd for leaders of the two parties to argue over who was responsible for the deficit or the potential collapse of the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>''My position is, they were both there when it happened -- nobody else was there,'' he said, adding: ''But now they're going to present you with massive and exciting plans to solve these problems. And they're going to present you, both parties, with the mother of all tax cuts to fix this.''</p>
        <p>And he said of taxpayers' Social Security contributions: ''As soon as that money hits Washington -- faster than Domino's can deliver pizza -- it goes out the door.''</p>
        <p>Apparently referring to both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, he added: ''All they're going to do is lean forward with tears in their eyes in 1996 and say, 'I feel your pain, and I'm going to protect Social Security as we know it.' ''</p>
        <p>The speech today was what is currently the only scheduled public appearance through the Labor Day weekend by Mr. Perot, who drew 19 million votes as an independent Presidential candidate in 1992.</p>
        <p>The Perot campaign is expected to rely largely on free television appearances, like ''Larry King Live,'' and on television commercials.</p>
        <p>Reaction today to Mr. Perot was polite but not thunderous. Still, many veterans in the crowd said they liked what Mr. Perot had to say and might consider voting for him if they thought he had a chance of winning. The problem for Mr. Perot appears to be that virtually nobody interviewed thought he had such a chance.</p>
        <p>''Most of what he says is right, but he just won't have enough backing to get in because of the last time, him dropping out of the race and all,'' said Dick Dickens of Warner Robins, Ga., who served as technical sergeant in the Air Force in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968.</p>
        <p>Said Robert Hemphill, a former Army captain from Virginia: ''I voted for the guy last time, but not now. That'd be a wasted vote. He'd have to really show some progress for me to even consider it. He'd have to equal the others in the polls.'' He quickly added: ''Not that I necessarily believe in polls.''</p>
        <p>Rodney G. Wilkinson, of Gulfport, Miss., an explosives specialist who served in Korea and Vietnam, also said he had supported Mr. Perot in 1992 but said: ''I can't afford to vote for him this time. If we all vote for Perot we'll just do what we did last time, and that's elect Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Wilkinson said he was impressed by Mr. Perot's speech. ''If he could talk for one minute without quoting some figure or statistic,'' he said, ''I think I'd like him better. But I guess his figures are accurate. He sure as hell sounds like he knows what he's talking about.''</p>
        <p>Few veterans in the crowd said they would vote for President Clinton. As Dennis P. Wall, state commander of the V.F.W. in New Jersey, put it: ''It's between Dole and Perot, as far as I'm concerned. They're both veterans, and they're hard-working Americans and, like I say, they're both veterans.''</p>
        <p>One Ohio man who said he would vote for the Clinton-Gore ticket, John McDonald, who served as an Army private in the occupation of Germany after World War II, said he was amused by Mr. Perot's evident inability to find a running mate.</p>
        <p>''I guess he's having trouble getting someone who shares his philosophy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot said that at 27 million Americans strong, veterans as a group could swing the election.</p>
        <p>He urged them not to be manipulated by propaganda ''just like Tokyo Rose and people like that dumped on you during World War II.</p>
        <p>''Let's strap in one more time,'' said Mr. Perot, a Naval veteran. ''You guys get organized and decide who's going to lead this country into the 21st century. I know you'll make the right decision.''</p>
