        <p>Letter from Victor M Sher, president, Sierra Coub Legal Defense Fund, praises citizen action for helping to prevent gold mine venture in Yellowstone National Park (Aug 13 news article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Americans have much to celebrate over the agreement reached among the Clinton Administration, the Canadian-based Crown Butte mining companies and environmental organizations to stop the proposed New World mine outside of Yellowstone National Park (news article. Aug. 13). America's first national park will thus be spared from destruction by toxic mine waste. One catalyst behind this agreement, however, has been ignored -- citizen enforcement of Federal environmental law.</p>
        <p>Negotiations that led to the agreement began only after local citizens groups took Crown Butte to court for violating the Clean Water Act. The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund represented the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, the Beartooth Alliance and seven other conservation groups. Last fall, the Federal court found Crown Butte and its associated companies in violation of the law. Faced with possible fines of more than $135 million, it was good business on Crown Butte's part to agree to a $65 million property swap and $22.5 million cleanup fees.</p>

        <p>Citizen suits allow individuals and local organizations to take on giants in government and industry and directly influence actions that affect their quality of life, even where, as here, public agencies fail to act. Without these safeguards, the American public and Yellowstone National Park would have been at the mercy of Crown Butte under the antiquated 1872 Mining Law, which allows private entities to acquire public land for mining for as little as $2.50 an acre regardless of the public interest.</p>
        <p>Public input in decision-making is a hallmark of our democracy. It is essential to remember how well this component of environmental laws -- the rights of citizens to enforce them in court -- has worked. Everyone needs help when a giant visits the neighborhood.</p>
