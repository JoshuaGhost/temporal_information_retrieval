        <p>Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday on the unexpected strength of the latest economic statistics, which heightened investor fears that inflation would accelerate, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy soon.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond dropped 22/32 , to a price of 9615/32  ; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. What perhaps bothered the bulls most yesterday were signs that the expected slowdown for the third quarter may not materialize.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department revised the second quarter's gross domestic product gain sharply upward, to 4.8 percent from 4.2 percent. Moreover, surprisingly strong housing sales in July, up 7.9 percent, to an annualized rate of 783,000 units, almost certainly shocked market participants who were looking for signs of moderation in the wake of the strong G.D.P. revision.</p>
        <p>Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that ''the economic statistics released today reaffirmed the economy's bouyancy.'' He added, ''Initial claims for unemployment insurance are still relatively low despite recent modest increases in both the weekly numbers and the four-week averages, second-quarter G.D.P. growth proved to be even stronger than initially reported, and new-home sales noticeably exceeded even the highest expectations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fine said that ''the downward revision to business inventories increases the chances that third-quarter G.D.P. growth, while more moderate than the April-to-June period, will also exceed the Federal Reserve's trend rate of maximum, noninflationary growth, which implies a continued bias toward tightening on the part of both the Federal Open Market Committee and the bond market.''</p>
        <p>The open market committee, the Fed panel that sets interest rate policy, last met on Aug. 20 and chose not to raise rates. But its next meeting is set for Sept. 24, and it is possible, though highly unlikely, that the committee could opt to shift rates even before then if other data are strong enough to alarm the central bank.</p>
        <p>According to Maureen Mooney, a market analyst with Gov Px, a bond pricing service, activity was average after deducting the volume of trading in 14-day cash management bills that were auctioned yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Government was selling $30 billion of the short-term bills to bridge a brief shortfall in cash flow expected in September. Dealers said the average rate at auction was 5.24 percent and the bid-to-cover ratio, a low 2 to 1, which reflected the weakness in the market generated by fears that the Fed would raise rates soon.</p>
        <p>Selling did quicken in the afternoon, but some traders suspect that investors who held long positions took advantage of some index-fund buying by portfolio managers to get out on an uptick after the recent price declines in the market. And because of the thinness in volume, price movements were exaggerated.</p>
        <p>Today, the Treasury market will have an abbreviated session and close early. Thus, with a shortened session and long weekend ahead of next week's employment report, few traders yesterday were willing to be buyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fine said that perhaps the bigger surprise was the jump in July new-home sales, which nearly matches the high for the year that was seen in February.</p>
