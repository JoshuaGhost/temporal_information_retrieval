        <p>Because the pool of players is comparatively small, the performance opportunities are plentiful and the repertory is varied, the musicians who specialize in period instruments  tend to shuffle from one ensemble to the next with extraordinary rapidity. A viola da gamba player, for example, might work in a Baroque orchestra one week, as a continuo player in a chamber group the next and in a consort of viols the week after that.</p>
        <p>For the directors of these porous ensembles, the administration must be terrifying, given that the larger the band, the denser the potential conflicts with other groups demanding the same musicians' services. Listeners, at least, can find some small measure of amusement tracing the players' trails from group to group.</p>

        <p>For the directors of these porous ensembles, the administration must be terrifying, given that the larger the band, the denser the potential conflicts with other groups demanding the same musicians' services. Listeners, at least, can find some small measure of amusement tracing the players' trails from group to group.</p>
        <p>Phantasm, a viol consort that brings together musicians from the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, Fretwork and other groups, was formed in London two years ago. The group has just made its first recording, a traversal of the Purcell Fantasias, several of which were included in its New York debut program at the Frick Collection on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The first half of the program was devoted to pieces by Gibbons and Byrd, works rich not only in the exquisitely melancholy character that pervades the music of the English Renaissance, but also in the playful virtuosity that keeps the music from seeming unremittingly dour. Byrd's ''In Nomine'' settings, for example, have a graceful, meditative quality from which a sense of mortality is never very distant. Yet their carefully balanced chordal devotions give way to fleet, intricate counterpoint.</p>
        <p>Gibbons and Purcell retained this sense of structure to varying degrees. In Fantasias Nos. 7 and 11, for four viols, Purcell offers a magnified, slightly more brightly colored road map of the path from sublime intensity to virtuosic elaboration. Gibbons, by contrast, shortened the journey from darkness to light, diving quickly into energetic variations.</p>
        <p>There was, at times, a comfortably homespun quality about the Phantasm performance. One had a sense that the works had not been polished to death, but instead were played with an exploratory sense, as if they were being discovered afresh.</p>
        <p>Intonation occasionally went astray, and there were moments when the performances could have generated brighter sparks. Yet in their best moments, the players produced a sound of great beauty. Individual lines were clear and distinct, and when a line sang out above the others, the players helped it with a subtle touch of vibrato, an effect not often heard at viol concerts.</p>
        <p>The players in Phantasm are Laurence Dreyfus, Wendy Gillespie, Jonathan Manson, Markku Luolajan-Mikkola and Martha McGaughey.</p>
