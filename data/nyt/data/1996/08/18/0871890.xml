        <p>Brian Moore's recent fiction has offered timely investigations of political and moral issues -- the conflict between Ireland and England, the problems of a highly principled Roman Catholic Cardinal in Communist Poland -- but his new novel may ruffle more feathers. In the guise of a thriller, ''The Statement'' (Dutton) is a searing indictment of the long delay in prosecuting Frenchmen accused of collaborating with the Nazis during World War II. Mr. Moore's protagonist is a fictionalized version of Paul Touvier, the only French citizen convicted of crimes against humanity. Last month Mr. Touvier died at 81 in a prison hospital outside of Paris, a month after the book was published in the United States.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Moore's view that people in France would prefer not to remember war crimes: guilt and retribution are matters to be ignored. In Mr. Touvier's case, the author's anger is directed not only against him for his role in the execution of Jews but also against the Catholic clergy, who sheltered him during the 40 years he was at large in France and who gave him absolution and were instrumental in getting him a Presidential pardon. ''It occurred to me,'' said Mr. Moore, ''that if this had happened in Ireland, where I was born, the Church would have taken exactly the same tack, because it's not democratic and never has been.''</p>

        <p>Brian Moore's recent fiction has offered timely investigations of political and moral issues -- the conflict between Ireland and England, the problems of a highly principled Roman Catholic Cardinal in Communist Poland -- but his new novel may ruffle more feathers.

        <p>It is Mr. Moore's view that people in France would prefer not to remember war crimes: guilt and retribution are matters to be ignored. In Mr. Touvier's case, the author's anger is directed not only against him for his role in the execution of Jews but also against the Catholic clergy, who sheltered him during the 40 years he was at large in France and who gave him absolution and were instrumental in getting him a Presidential pardon. ''It occurred to me,'' said Mr. Moore, ''that if this had happened in Ireland, where I was born, the Church would have taken exactly the same tack, because it's not democratic and never has been.''</p>
        <p>In the novel, he speculates that the character, and by inference Mr. Touvier himself, was protected by other people of rank in and out of Government. One prominent Frenchman, Maurice Papon, is also charged with crimes against humanity, and his trial may finally take place next month. Mr. Moore said that he had the feeling that if Mr. Papon is tried, ''other people of his generation will be implicated,'' and he hopes that they, too, will be brought to justice.</p>
