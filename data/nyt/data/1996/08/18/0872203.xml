        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''On 'The Price is Right,' Her Weight Wasn't'' (Earning It, July 21) illuminated  some of the problems that the 40 million American women approaching menopause could face, whether they are TV personalities, business executives or homemakers.</p>
        <p>Weight gain is a natural part of aging for women and men. It is our nation's perpetuated myth that a woman should keep the same shape from the time she reaches sexual maturity until she dies. American society has become so fixated on the elusive youthful image of beauty that the value and the beauty of the menopausal woman is automatically excluded from that category.</p>
        <p>What kind of society are we creating?  Should a natural life transition be grounds for dismissal from employment? What would be next -- gray hair?</p>
        <p>Despite the women's movement, menopausal and pre-menopausal women, especially in the workplace, are still hiding from the stigma that we continue to impart to them. And if menopausal women seek protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act, this will only work to further promote the fallacy that menopause is a disability rather than a normal part of life.</p>
        <p>We need to expand our definitions and re-evaluate our standards as a society. Let's stop the myth of eternal youth and inject a dose of healthy reality.</p>
