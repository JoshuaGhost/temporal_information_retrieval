        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Like James R. Oestreich, I remember the ''Egmont'' Overture during the memorial service at the 1972 Munich Games, where I was a United States Olympic official $(''From Atlanta to Munich Via 'Egmont,' '' Aug. 4$). While he had his restorative music for the Atlanta bombing in Caramoor, I had mine here in Atlanta with a glorious and moving performance of Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Yoel Levi. It was of comfort to read Mr. Oestreich's column and know that others were reflecting and finding succor through music.</p>

        <p>Like James R.

        <p>Yes, remembering does matter. Artistic performance is important largely because its evanescence mirrors the ever-present ''now'' of life as we live it. It sets a frame of time and space about the issue of life, thus directing us to pay heed to that very thing which daily slips past our attention. We can all take comfort and meaning from this most ephemeral of the arts in a quest for understanding of all that surrounds us.</p>
        <p>As in Munich, our hearts were wounded by the Centennial Park bombing in the midst of the beautiful idealism of the Olympics festivities. We all need to heal. Those of us with the privilege of being at the center of creation of the Olympic Arts Festival's exhibitions, music and theater were amazed by the accident of scheduling of this piece, which turned out to be an exquisite musical homage to all who have been affected by this pointless act of terrorism.</p>
