        <p>At a celebration of Jamaican  independence in Prospect Park the other day, the seating arrangement offered a snapshot of the political heavyweights of Caribbean Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>City Councilwoman Una Clarke, who organized the event, sat at a center table up front, with the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden. Later, she was joined by Mr. Golden's counterparts from Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as the Public Advocate, Mark Green.</p>
        <p>Just to the right sat Roy Hastick, head of the Caribbean-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, surrounded by members of his influential business group.</p>
        <p>And somewhere in the middle of the Picnic House sat Dr. Lamuel Stanislaus, a retired dentist and the former ambassador to the United Nations from Grenada, flanked by his wife and grandchild.</p>
        <p>Once, Dr. Stanislaus was considered the don of Brooklyn's Caribbean community, the leader of a generation of West Indian immigrants who became active in the Democratic Party. He distinguished Caribbean issues from African-American ones and helped make the annual West Indian Day parade on Labor Day a major political fete. He was close to former Mayor Edward I. Koch, he helped arrange a meeting between Caribbean leaders and former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo after the 1991 Crown Heights riots, and was one of two Caribbean-Americans on Mayor Giuliani's transition team.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stanislaus, who is 76, is still active in politics -- he is now plotting to unseat the incumbent in the 42d Assembly District. But his influence has diminished as Brooklyn's Caribbean community has grown in both quantity -- 370,000 people, according to the 1990 census -- and clout.</p>
        <p>''The kind of role that Dr. Stanislaus played without being elected is what other ethnic groups have had -- a power broker,'' said Hulbert James, who headed African-American and Caribbean affairs in the Dinkins administration. ''The difference now is that new leaders are those who the people have chosen.''</p>
        <p>There is Jamaican-born Councilwoman Clarke, who defeated the Democrats' chosen candidate in 1991. Now, mayoral hopefuls Ruth  Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, and Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, are seeking her endorsement, she said. ''I think my election was a wake-up call,'' said Mrs. Clarke, who sits on President Clinton's campaign platform committee. ''I think they understand and can count numbers. They understand the growing presence of the Caribbean community.''</p>
        <p>Brooklyn has other elected officials from the West Indies: Assemblyman Nick Perry, a native of Jamaica, and Councilman Lloyd Henry of Belize. But the ones who appear to wield the most power at the moment are Mrs. Clarke and Mr. Hastick, who served on the local community board, worked on Mrs. Clarke's campaign and is proficient in marshaling a large constituency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastick, a native of Grenada, said the appearance of several top politicians, including Mr. Golden, Ms. Messinger and the former Police Commissioner, Raymond Kelly, at his group's 11th anniversary celebrations last week, was a sign of how much things have changed since he first became politically involved 20 years ago. ''In those days, it wasn't as popular to say you're Caribbean,'' he said. ''Now it's different. Caribbeans are a much stronger community. They're more involved in politics, citizenship, voting.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Dr. Stanislaus still calls Caribbeans the ''sleeping giant'' of city politics. Though he is a registered Democrat, he was close to President Ronald Reagan, who authorized the American invasion of Grenada in 1983 and favored Dr. Stanislaus's childhood friend, Herbert A. Blaize, to lead the country.</p>
        <p>And though he is pleased about his community's growing muscle, the retired dentist in the dapper wingtips seems ambivalent about the new personalities. ''In our community,'' he said wryly, ''we have too many aspiring leaders and too few followers.''</p>
