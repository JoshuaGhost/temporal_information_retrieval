        <p>A ''software hiccup'' at the United States Postal Service caused nearly two weeks worth of mail to the Patent and Trademark Office's Washington branch -- an estimated 50,000 pieces -- to be returned to senders.</p>
        <p>Patent applications and other time-sensitive documents may well have been among the pieces affected, officials said.</p>
        <p>A postal service spokesman, Frank Brennan, said a software glitch caused the patent office's Washington ZIP code, 20231, to be eliminated from the postal service's data base. As a result, all of the mail headed to that ZIP code through the postal service's computer-operated optical character readers was marked for return, he said.</p>
        <p>Mail that was processed manually or through the postal service's mechanized system was likely to be delivered, Mr. Brennan said. The error was discovered yesterday morning and corrected by early afternoon.</p>
        <p>The patent office said it would extend any deadlines not met because of the delivery error, including applications for new patents, trademarks and extensions for intellectual property rights.</p>
