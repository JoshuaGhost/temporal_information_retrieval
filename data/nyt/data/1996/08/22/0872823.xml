        <p>Germany's Ifo institute said yesterday that its business-climate index for July jumped to 94.1 from 90.4 in June, far exceeding economists' expectations for a figure of around 91. The index had been hotly awaited in financial markets. Many traders had looked for a weak figure, which would make it more likely that the German central bank would cut its main money market interest rate, the securities repurchase rate, today.</p>
