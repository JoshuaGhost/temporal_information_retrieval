        <p>On the day DENNIS RODMAN was supposedly settling down, he brought chaos -- and his autobiography -- to midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodman, the Chicago Bulls basketball star, had said he was in town to marry his girlfriend, Stacy Yarborough. He arrived in a police-escorted horse-drawn carriage at Barnes &amp; Noble on Fifth Avenue yesterday in a lacy white wedding dress with long gloves and a veil over his neatly coiffed, bright orange hair.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom (or was he the bride?) was surrounded by a group of beautiful ushers (or were they bridesmaids?), all in black tie. The 6-foot-8, 210-pound forward, his tattooed biceps glistening beneath see-through sleeves, waved to hundreds of cheering spectators as he made his way to the bookstore to autograph copies of his autobiography, ''Bad as I Wanna Be'' (Delacorte), which has been a best seller since spring.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he had indeed married, Mr. Rodman shrugged his shoulders. He said he was going to Rome on his honeymoon, ''me and someone else.''</p>
        <p>Miss Yarborough, who dances at Scores, a nightclub on East 60th Street, was nowhere to be found. Lonnie Hanover, a spokesman for the club, said he did not know her plans.</p>
