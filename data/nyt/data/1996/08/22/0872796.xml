        <p>Article on dispute between Manhattan Borough Pres Ruth W Messinger and Parks Comr Howard J Stern over his plan to use city employees to count how many times his dog, Boomer, is petted so he can get dog into Guinness Book of World Records as world's most petted dog; photos of Boomer and other politicians' pets (M)</p>

        <p>Now that Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan has demanded that Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern keep his popular golden retriever Boomer, at home, she has triggered far more than egregious puns about fur flying in the dog days of August. Ms. Messinger's attack is, in fact, the latest reminder of a tradition as rich and deep as it is unexplored: political dogs that get their owners in the doghouse.</p>
        <p>Consider Fala, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's beloved black Scottie, perhaps the most famous Presidential pet in American history.

        <p>Now that Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan has demanded that Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern keep his popular golden retriever Boomer, at home, she has triggered far more than egregious puns about fur flying in the dog days of August. Ms. Messinger's attack is, in fact, the latest reminder of a tradition as rich and deep as it is unexplored: political dogs that get their owners in the doghouse.</p>
        <p>Consider Fala, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's beloved black Scottie, perhaps the most famous Presidential pet in American history. In 1944, Roosevelt's Republican opponents circulated the rumor that the President had inadvertently left Fala in the Aleutian Islands and sent a destroyer back to fetch him -- at a huge cost in taxpayer dollars.</p>
        <p>''These Republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me, or my wife, or on my sons,'' Roosevelt shot back, in what was to become one of the most famous speeches of his Presidency. ''No, not content with that, they now include my little dog, Fala.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern, not surprisingly, likened Boomer's travails this week to those of the illustrious F.D.R. pet. For those who have missed key developments in the Messinger-Boomer battle, the background is this: Last week, after Ms. Messinger learned that Mr. Stern would be using city employees to count with a numerical clicker how many times Boomer was petted -- part of a scheme of Mr. Stern's to get his charge into the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most petted dog -- she wrote him an angry letter and released it to reporters. Ms. Messinger is running for Mayor, although she has not made a formal announcement.</p>
        <p>''A city-funded 'clicker counter' may seem of little fiscal moment in a city facing billions upon billions of dollars in budget gaps,'' she wrote. ''But symbolically, it speaks loudly and clearly of a Parks Department that, literally and figuratively, appears to be going to the dogs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Messinger added that it was time for Mr. Stern ''to put the people of New York ahead of your pet and to start using city workers to maintain and improve city services, not to exercise the legs or to advance the reputation of Boomer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern countered that Boomer costs the city nothing and that an aide who is with him anyway holds the dog and lets children pet Boomer while Mr. Stern speaks at public events. Whoever holds Boomer, Mr. Stern said, will also hold the clicker.</p>
        <p>Boomer regularly goes to the office and city parks with Mr. Stern, who said no city workers walk Boomer as Ms. Messinger also charged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern added that Ms. Messinger has no sense of humor and that she dislikes his dog. ''Somehow, this dog stirs her,'' he said. ''When she sees Boomer, her hair stands on end.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Messinger said this was untrue. ''Boomer's a great dog,'' she said, adding, ''I grew up with three dogs that I walked in Central Park.''</p>
        <p>At present, however, the only creatures Ms. Messinger keeps at home are the worms that work her compost heap. ''Fortunately, they need nothing but garbage,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Stern evoked the legacy of Fala, Boomer is more reminiscent of Max, the large, late golden retriever of Betsy Gotbaum, who, while Parks Commissioner in the early 1990's, regularly brought her dog to the office and to city parks.</p>
        <p>Max ignited no political battles during Ms. Gotbaum's tenure, but he did get his owners into trouble in 1984 at the funeral of Ms. Gotbaum's father, Henry Flower, by bounding out of the car and knocking the funeral director partly into the open grave.</p>
        <p>''It was the worst thing Max did,'' said Ms. Gotbaum, who is now president of the New-York Historical Society. The funeral director subsequently sued Ms. Gotbaum's husband, Victor, the city's pre-eminent labor leader in the 1970's and 80's, saying the dog had seriously injured the funeral director's knee. The Gotbaums settled for $15,000.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's yellow Labrador retriever, Goalie, has also created a few troubles. In April, the gossip columnist Liz Smith reported that Goalie had ''snapped'' at her when she reached out her hand, and she left Gracie Mansion with what she called a ''souvenir blood blister.'' But Ms. Smith -- her critics say she never bites a hand that feeds her -- diplomatically pointed out that Goalie has cataracts and that ''side movements upset him.''</p>
        <p>The Mayor agreed. ''He didn't really snap at her,'' he said. ''He was startled.'' Mr. Giuliani, who regularly turns down requests for interviews on the city budget and other concerns, agreed instantly this week to talk for a few moments in his office about Goalie.</p>
        <p>''He's a wonderful dog,'' he enthused, adding that ''on his mother's side, he goes back 40 years'' as a seeing eye dog. But Goalie's cataracts kept him from his ancestral calling, and he lives at Gracie Mansion, where he has, the Mayor said at a news conference this week, ''play dates all the time'' with Boomer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he did not want to be dragged into the Boomer dispute, although he added that if Ms. Messinger's remarks were meant as a political attack, ''I would say it was an ill-conceived one.</p>
        <p>''It's very bad to run against a dog,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Former Mayor Edward I. Koch had the same opinion. ''People who run for public office should not throw rocks at dogs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch's deputy mayor for criminal justice, Herbert J. Sturz, later an editorial writer for The New York Times, was occasionally accompanied to his office by a very large chocolate brown poodle named Trotwood after David Copperfield's great aunt, Betsey Trotwood. ''He was a very temperamental poodle, and he didn't like to stay at home,'' said Mr. Sturz, who runs the Trotwood Corporation, a managing general partner for the development of Hunter's Point in Queens.</p>
        <p>The dogs who may have created the greatest political storm for their owner were Him and Her, the beagles of President Lyndon B. Johnson. This was one case, however, where  the fault clearly lay not with the dogs, but their master. In one infamous incident in 1964, photographers captured Him and then Her as the President lifted each by the ears.</p>
        <p>Mail from outraged citizens all over the United States rained down on the White House.</p>
        <p>Checkers, too, played only a passive role in his celebrity, though he is the most famous cocker spaniel in American political history. Richard M. Nixon, who in 1952 was running for Vice President on the G.O.P. ticket with Dwight D. Eisenhower, evoked the dog when he defended himself against charges that he had received improper gifts. Nixon said that he had indeed received a gift -- Checkers -- and that ''the kids love that dog and I just want to say right now that, regardless of what 'they' say about it, we're going to keep it.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Stern says, Boomer has been petted 219 times since Sunday, the day his count began. The record for most petted dog, reported in the 1997 edition of the Guinness book, which will be out in stores in October, is held by Josh the Wonder Dog, a terrier mix from Glen Burnie, Md.</p>
        <p>The book says Josh has been petted 408,127 times since October 1989.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern was unaware of this yesterday. ''Oh my goodness,'' he said when informed. ''I had no idea what a long row we had to hoe.''</p>
