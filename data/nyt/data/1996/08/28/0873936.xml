        <p>In an unusual letter sent to the homes of every New York City firefighter and officer, a top Fire Department administrator has described a reckless atmosphere in which many of the department's safety rules are being ignored. Specifically citing the alteration of an oxygen mask that could pose a danger to firefighters, he warned that chiefs and officers could face transfers or other disciplinary measures if the safety rules are not more strictly enforced.</p>

        <p>In an unusual letter sent to the homes of every New York City firefighter and officer, a top Fire Department administrator has described a reckless atmosphere in which many of the department's safety rules are being ignored. Specifically citing the alteration of an oxygen mask that could pose a danger to firefighters, he warned that chiefs and officers could face transfers or other disciplinary measures if the safety rules are not more strictly enforced.</p>
        <p>Officials said the letter, mailed last week by the Chief of Department, Frank P. Cruthers, to the nearly 12,000 fire officers and firefighters, was prompted by the discovery in early July of a crude homemade device, known as a bite bar, inside a firefighter's oxygen mask.</p>
        <p>The bars -- used by some firefighters for several years but rarely discussed -- allow firefighters to wear the cumbersome masks without strapping them on, but by simply holding them in place with their teeth. Many firefighters have complained that full-face oxygen masks are constricting, that they muffle voices in chaotic firefighting situations and that they become very hot while the wearer is fighting fires. The bite bar, illegal under department rules, allows a firefighter to remove the mask and put it back in place again quickly when necessary.</p>
        <p>But in his letter, Mr. Cruthers called the bars ''a hazard to the wearer, to our operations and to those whose survival depends on our operations.'' The main danger, fire officials said, is that if a firefighter becomes unconscious during a fire, the mask, not secured to his head, could fall away as he releases his grip. The other danger, Mr. Cruthers wrote, is that the bars damage the mask's seals.</p>
        <p>Because firefighters share the masks, the damage could go undetected until another firefighter walks into the heat of a fire and the mask suddenly fills with smoke.</p>
        <p>The stern tone of the letter, first reported yesterday in Newsday, and the fact that it arrived at the firefighters' homes -- an unprecedented step for a policy memorandum -- shocked and angered many in the department. But William M. Feehan, the First Deputy Commissioner, said the decision was made to send it to homes ''because we wanted to make sure it wasn't lost in the shuffle and, in our minds, we believed it would heighten their awareness that we were really concerned about this.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Feehan described the discovery of the bite bar during servicing of the mask as ''the final straw'' that put the warnings into motion, he said several other instances in which rules were being disregarded or willfully broken underscored a need for top officials to threaten action.</p>
        <p>Other breaches of safety procedures included reckless driving of ladder trucks and engines, failure to wear a new protective hood on helmets, and riding helmetless to or from fires in the backs of trucks.</p>
        <p>And in a directive aimed at top fire officers, the letter said that battalion chiefs must, like those under them, wear so-called bunker gear, heavy pants and jackets that protect firefighters from intense heat.</p>
        <p>''You don't ask your people to do anything you wouldn't do,'' Mr. Feehan said. ''And when battalion chiefs are not wearing the gear, it sends a message to those below that it's not a priority.''</p>
        <p>While both the firefighters' union and the fire officers' union said yesterday that they also condemn the use of bite bars and other time-saving devices known among firefighters as ''cheaters,'' Richard Brower, the president of the fire officers' union, criticized the department's letter as overly harsh and expedient.</p>
        <p>''They've known for a while that there are problems with the masks, but this letter simply says, 'Wear the masks right,' and doesn't talk about solutions to the underlying problem,'' he said. ''I find their concern a little disingenuous.''</p>
        <p>Two firefighters who spoke on condition of anonymity yesterday said that while they have never used a bite bar, it has always been a tempting way for many firefighters in the ''macho, do-what-you-have-to-do'' environment of the department.</p>
        <p>''It gives you the impression that you're quicker, you're faster, you can do more and stay in longer with more oxygen,'' one firefighter said. ''But if things go wrong, you can end up in big trouble if you're using one.''</p>
