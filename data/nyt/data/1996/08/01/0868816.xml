        <p>The Federal Reserve took a step today to loosen the Depression-era law that limits banks from competing in the securities business, proposing new regulations that would allow some of the largest banking companies to expand greatly the business they conduct on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The proposals represent a clear if limited victory for many of the nation's largest banking companies, including J. P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, Bank of America and Nationsbank.</p>
        <p>The most important change would allow the securities subsidiaries of bank holding companies to generate as much as 25 percent of their revenue from underwriting and dealing stocks and many types of bonds, up from a limit of 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The Fed also proposed ending or scaling back some of the ''firewalls'' it had required banking companies to establish between banking and securities operations. Among the biggest changes would be easing the restrictions on sharing employees and directors and ending the ban on banks helping to market the activities of the securities subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Banking industry executives said they expected the proposals to be adopted. The Fed requested comments from the affected industries on the revenue proposal by Sept. 30 and on the other proposals by Sept. 3. The Fed was expected to make final decisions within a matter of months.</p>
        <p>Banks had been pushing for the rules to be eased as part of legislative changes to the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which divided up the financial industry to shield Federally insured banks from what was seen as the riskier ethos of Wall Street. But the attempt to remove the barriers in Congress broke down this spring amid feuding within the financial services industry.</p>
        <p>Since then, banks, supported by the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Jim Leach, a Republican from Iowa, have been pressing the Fed to use its power over bank holding companies to accomplish some of the same ends.</p>
        <p>The Fed has allowed bank holding companies to establish so-called Section 20 securities subsidiaries for the last nine years, and there are currently 39 American and foreign banks that have done so. The subsidiaries are permitted to underwrite and deal in securities that banks are otherwise barred from. Banks are permitted to trade some securities, like United States Government bonds.</p>
        <p>''We are in total sync with the Fed on where banks need flexibility in their operations, so we commend the Fed for proposing that flexibility and doing it in such timely fashion,'' said Larry LaRocco, the managing director of the ABA Securities Association, an affiliate of the American Bankers Association, which represents the 20 big American banks with large securities operations.</p>
        <p>''It means that some of the banks that are bumping up against the revenue limits can move forward with their underwriting activities, and it means they will no longer be hamstrung by regulations on cross-marketing and sharing employees,'' Mr. LaRocco said.</p>
        <p>Bank executives said, however, that the Fed proposals should not slow efforts to overhaul or repeal Glass-Steagall.</p>
        <p>''While we fully support this modest step, we think the time is long overdue for the full dismantling of the artificial constraints of the Glass-Steagall Act that are relics of markets and thinking more than 60 years old,'' said Alan S. MacDonald, Citibank's executive vice president and global head of corporate finance.</p>
        <p>But the Securities Industry Association, which represents Wall Street firms, said that the Fed's action could undercut efforts to forge a consensus on repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act by giving big banks much of what they want.</p>
        <p>The association said the Fed should grant only temporary relief to Section 20 subsidiaries that are reaching the regulatory limits on the amount of business they can do as a way of spurring banking companies to negotiate a legislative solution.</p>
        <p>''While clearly there is a need for a temporary solution for those Section  20 bank affiliates that have bumped up against the current 10 percent limit based on their revenues,'' said Steve Judge, the Securities Industry Association's senior vice president for government affairs, ''for the Fed to propose allowing a generous and long-term solution, as they did today, just puts us one step back in our efforts to hammer out an approach to modernize existing Federal laws and regulations covering the financial services industry.''</p>
        <p>In releasing its proposals, the Fed said the securities subsidiaries of the banking companies it regulates ''have operated in a safe and sound manner without adverse effects on their affiliated banks or the public, and have provided additional competition in the securities market.''</p>
        <p>The Fed said it believed ''that this increase in the revenue limit would not give rise to the potential dangers to commercial banks from general underwriting activities that motivated Congress to enact the Glass-Steagall Act.''</p>
