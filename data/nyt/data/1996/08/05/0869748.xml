        <p>Marilyn Gelber, New York City's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, has been forced out of office at an extremely sensitive moment. The Giuliani administration is trying to conclude delicate negotiations over the protection of upstate watershed lands, in which Ms. Gelber has played a central role.

        <p>Ms. Gelber's friends say she is being punished because she resisted hiring patronage appointees thrust on her by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's office.

        <p>Marilyn Gelber, New York City's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, has been forced out of office at an extremely sensitive moment. The Giuliani administration is trying to conclude delicate negotiations over the protection of upstate watershed lands, in which Ms. Gelber has played a central role. While the Mayor has a right to shuffle his staff at will, the timing of this particular change is troubling.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gelber's friends say she is being punished because she resisted hiring patronage appointees thrust on her by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's office. Mr. Giuliani's aides say the problem was actually bad management, involving, in particular, mounting complaints about water bills, which are the department's responsibility.</p>
        <p>It is true that homeowners complain frequently about getting bills that are inaccurate, and about the long time it takes to have them corrected. But water bills have been a problem for nearly a decade now. Mr. Giuliani should have deferred making changes until the more crucial matter of water quality was resolved.</p>
        <p>The Department of Environmental Protection is a peculiar agency. The name suggests issues like land preservation and clean air, but most of its work involves pipes -- sewers, mains and tunnels. Conventional wisdom used to be that running the department was a job for an engineer. Through the last two administrations, however, the department's overriding concern was to protect the city's water supplies and avoid the need to build a ruinously expensive filtration plant.</p>
        <p>The city's water comes from reservoirs upstate, where increased development has begun to threaten its purity. Ms. Gelber won the confidence of both the watershed towns who resented city interference and environmental groups who were pushing for the strictest possible controls. Representatives of both sides expressed dismay at her sudden departure.</p>
        <p>She was forced out of office before her critical task was done. Environmentalists have been complaining that the agreement may not have enough controls to guarantee long-term protection of the water. The 34 upstate towns that must ratify the agreement are skittish. The final pact was supposed to be finished months ago, but one issue after another has halted progress.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration has expressed confidence that Ms. Gelber's departure will not be a drag on negotiations, and that the agreement could be completed within weeks. If that is the case, it seems cruel to elbow her out of the way before she could receive the praise she deserves upon the signing.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani has said that the department needed to be reinvigorated, and appointed the Buildings Commissioner, Joel Miele, as Ms. Gelber's successor. Mr. Miele, an engineer, has been energetic in trying to bring about change at one of of the most hidebound agencies in city government. He may well be a good choice to handle the pipe end of the D.E.P. mandate. But he has no experience with the environment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gelber's contribution to the city's welfare has been substantial, and she should have been given a warmer departure.</p>
