        <p>This is a state that has not elected a Democrat to the United States Senate since 1932. And that is not likely to change soon.</p>
        <p>But the Republicans are hardly one big happy family. In the Republican contest for the nomination to seek Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat on Tuesday, a serious ideological rift has erupted in the primary fight between Sam Brownback, a hard-charging conservative, and Sheila Frahm, an old-fashioned moderate.</p>
        <p>The race has provoked a debate among many party loyalists about what it means to be a Republican. It is a clash that also reflects a larger battle now roiling the Republican Party across the nation, a tug-of-war that inflames issues like abortion and school prayer.</p>
        <p>''It's really been quite bitter,'' said Russell Getter, a political science professor at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.</p>
        <p>''I've not seen anything so heated and pointed in Kansas politics in the 25 years I've lived here.''</p>
        <p>Recent polls show a dead heat in the race between Mr. Brownback, a freshman Congressman and a lawyer, and Mrs. Frahm. As Lieutenant Governor, she was appointed to the Senate vacancy after Mr. Dole resigned in June to concentrate on his race for President.</p>
        <p>Coming just before the Republican convention, the Kansas primary is being closely watched as a measure of the Christian Coalition's strength, especially given such a vivid choice between candidates.</p>
        <p>''For evangelicals, this is going to be an extremely important election,'' said Burdette Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas.</p>
        <p>''They're not going to come out of this the same as they went in. Either they're going to emerge with a bigger foothold in Republican politics, or they're going to be found wanting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownback, 39, opposes legal abortion and favors a constitutional amendment allowing school prayer. Mrs. Frahm, 51, takes the opposite position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownback, one of the brash young leaders of Republican freshmen on Capitol Hill, promises a radical reduction in the size of the Federal Government, saying he would abolish the Secretaries of Education and Housing, among other Cabinet-level positions.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Frahm, meanwhile, has criticized what she calls the slash-and-burn approach on her party's right-wing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownback, who describes himself as a born-again believer, often talks about religious faith on the campaign trail, calling for ''a return to basic values.'' Mrs. Frahm, a Methodist, virtually never talks about her religion in public.</p>
        <p>This is not an election that is going to turn on farm programs or water policy on the Western Plains, despite the image of this state as a sea of wheat -- the amber waves of grain -- or of lonely little towns on the plains, like Mr. Dole's hometown, Russell.</p>
        <p>The vote-rich battleground, especially for Republicans, is here in prosperous Johnson County, a suburban sprawl of expensive new subdivisions and fancy shopping malls, outside Kansas City.</p>
        <p>One in five Republican voters in the state live in Johnson County. There are significantly more Republicans in Johnson County than in the more populous Wichita.</p>
        <p>And it is here that both Christian conservatives and social moderates show considerable strength. It is not uncommon for the two sides to face off in pitched battles for precinct committee and school board.</p>
        <p>Well-educated, prosperous and Republican, the voters here would seem to be united -- until it comes to social issues with religious overtones, especially abortion.</p>
        <p>''I think the bottom-line problem in our society is that God is missing,'' said Vic Clark, 46, and a strong supporter of Mr. Brownback. ''But people don't want to hear that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark, who sends his children to a private Christian school, said he supported tax vouchers for school-choice, and a cut in taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark said he knew many people in Johnson County who supported the Christian Coalition even though they are not religious.</p>
        <p>''They take a look at their property tax bill,'' he said, ''and they say, 'Hmm, I think I can live with this prayer in school thing, if they're going to fight for lower taxes.' ''</p>
        <p>In the same shopping mall, Diane Devine, 32, shook her head at the mention of Mr. Brownback and the Christian Coalition.</p>
        <p>''I'll be voting for Frahm,'' said Ms. Devine, an importer of coffee beans. ''Abortion is a woman's choice -- period.''</p>
        <p>A poll published on Friday in The Kansas City Star showed Mr. Brownback leading Mrs. Frahm 43 percent to 41 percent, with 16 percent undecided.</p>
        <p>Among voters who say they support the Christian Coalition, Mr. Brownback leads Mrs. Frahm by a huge margin, 67 percent to 22 percent. Those who did not identify themselves as Christian Coalition supporters, the poll found, supported Mrs. Frahm by 51 percent to 31 percent. Among the male respondents, Mr. Brownback held a 15-point lead, while Mrs. Frahm held an 11-point lead among the women.</p>
        <p>The poll, which was conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research of Maryland, was a telephone survey of 834 Kansans who said they were registered voters and regularly cast ballots. Interviews were conducted on July 29-31. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points.</p>
        <p>In the Democratic primary for the Senate nomination, Jill Docking, a Wichita stockbroker, is holding a 19-point lead over Joan Finney, a former Governor. Republicans outnumber Democrats in Kansas by 3 to 2.</p>
        <p>Kansas voters will also be selecting a replacement for Senator Nancy Kassebaum, who is retiring after three terms. Representative Pat Roberts, a moderate from Dodge City, does not face serious opposition in his party's primary. The Democrat seeking the seat, Sally Thompson, is running without opposition.</p>
        <p>In addition, the retirement of Representative Jan Meyers, a moderate Republican from eastern Kansas, has opened the way for another closely contested race with vivid ideological shadings.</p>
        <p>Vince Snowbarger, a conservative in the style of Mr. Brownback, is running neck-and-neck with Ed Eilert, a social moderate, according to the polls.</p>
        <p>Senator Kassebaum has endorsed Mrs. Frahm. Mr. Dole has pledged neutrality, but it is widely believed in Kansas that he is more comfortable with Mrs. Frahm's old-guard Republican style than with the conservatism of Mr. Brownback.</p>
        <p>''It's all going to depend on turnout,'' Professor Getter said. ''The moderates you can never depend on. They tend to take things for granted. We know the religious right will show up.'</p>

        <p>An article yesterday about the race for the Kansas Senate seat vacated by Bob Dole misidentified a candidate in the Democratic primary in some copies. She is Jill Docking, not Jill Dockery.</p>
