        <p>DELEGATES to the Democratic convention later this month will find the restaurant scene one of Chicago's delights, on a par with its architecture, lakeshore views and spirited local politics. Easily reached from the big downtown hotels are a bevy of sophisticated yet relaxed restaurants where a tie is optional and portions are geared to hearty Midwestern appetites. Service is generally congenial and informed without being fussy.</p>
        <p>The following five restaurants, all but one  in the booming River North neighborhood just north of the Loop, offer a microcosm of the city's rich variety of settings and cuisines. And all are suitable for small parties or, in their private rooms, a state delegation.</p>
        <p>Brasserie Jo</p>
        <p>Jean Joho, a native of Alsace and the chef-owner of the celebrated French restaurant  Everest, in partnership with the Chicago restaurateur extraordinaire Rich Melman, has conjured up a sprawling 1940's Parisian brasserie in River North. They've gotten the details right: banquettes imported from France, mirrors, cherrywood and marble trim, a glass-enclosed winter garden off the main room with wicker furniture. Check out the waiters' sleeve garters and the long zinc bar with the wheel rack holding hard-boiled eggs, just as in Paris. The state-of-the-art kitchen has monitors and cameras linking upstairs and downstairs crews -- a fusion of old and new that helped push the James Beard Foundation to name it the best new  restaurant of the year in the United States.</p>
        <p>Brasserie Jo's cooking may have had something to do with it, too. The assertively seasoned classic brasserie food is as Alsatian-accented as the ebullient Joho himself. The Alsatian herring -- house cured with lots of coriander but no sugar -- accompanied by mustardy potato salad, the leeks vinaigrette garnished with boiled egg, and the frisee and bacon salad (with or without egg) are all good ways to start. But I keep coming back for the superb onion tart with caramelized onions in a nutmeg-scented custard, from a family recipe of Joho's.</p>
        <p>On a recent dinner visit, half the room seemed to be ordering the croque-monsieur (the classic French ham-and-cheese sandwich on a brioche) or its vegetarian alternative made with onions, zucchini and red and green peppers, with mounds of crisp pommes frites. The platter of cold poached salmon enveloped in sliced cucumbers makes a good shared late-evening supper; sweet mussels are steamed in Riesling with shallots, garlic and parsley. The roasted leg of lamb with chunky ratatouille and potatoes gratin is only for those who can't get enough rosemary. On Saturday the plat du jour is back-in-style beef Wellington (well executed); on Tuesday it's smoked beef tongue poached and served thinly sliced with cornichon relish, pureed potatoes and sauteed spinach.</p>
        <p>The best desserts are also Alsatian, either the tart of apples, cut unusually thick, on a frangipane filling baked with meringue, or the very rich Kougelhof -- vanilla ice cream with a kirsch parfait center and a topping of cocoa and dried fruit. The list of inexpensive French wines includes almost 20 Alsatians such as a Josmeyer Sylvaner (1994) at $22, or there is the custom-brewed house Alsatian-style Hop La beer. ''Hop la,'' a French exclamation of joy, would be an equally fitting name for this exuberant brasserie.</p>
        <p>Chicago Chop House</p>
        <p>Carnivorous conventioneers can head for this restaurant, one of the city's top steakhouses. Spread through three stories of a restored Victorian brownstone, the bustling restaurant is decorated to the period with painted tin ceilings, dark woods, curving bars and 1,400 photographs of early Chicago. Downstairs near the piano bar is a gallery of famous Chicago gangsters; nearby are photos of famous Chicago mayors -- a sometimes arbitrary distinction made more problematic because they seemed to have frequented the same tailors and haberdashers. And for real edification, look for the photo of Sally Rand as Lady Godiva.</p>
        <p>Like many local steakhouses, Chicago Chop House is built on vaguely Italian-American foundations, so that the soup of the day is usually a creditable minestrone, the cherrystone clams casino are first-rate, and chicken is served vesuvio-style (pan-roasted with garlic, potatoes, peas and olive oil). The moment you are served a warm loaf of bread and an ice cream-sized scoop of whipped butter, you know what kind of portions you are in for. The prime aged steaks and chops are gargantuan, and entrees include salad and mashed or baked potatoes, making appetizers unnecessary for most mortals. On the large wine list is an impressive selection of California reds by glass and bottle, among them a rare and exceptional Turley Cellars Aida Vineyard zinfandel (1993) for $36.</p>
        <p>This is not the place for experiment and innovation -- the specials list has been the same for three years. The dependable charred bone-in 20-ounce prime rib is the house specialty, roasted rare, then run under the broiler -- resulting in prime rib texture with lightly crusted steak flavor. I prefer the tartness and texture of the broiled 24-ounce New York strips, and for sharing, the monstrous double and triple porterhouses (48 and 64 ounces). Those shunning red meat will find competent if unexciting chicken and seafood choices, including broiled king salmon and jumbo shrimp fried in light beer batter. To allay your nutritional scruples, order the steamed broccoli -- hollandaise on the side -- which looks like it was harvested from a tree farm.</p>
        <p>Topolobampo and</p>
        <p>Frontera Grill</p>
        <p>When a friend of a friend called from California recently and asked for a restaurant recommendation in Chicago, I suggested Topolobampo. When she heard it was Mexican, she was turned off, muttering that California has lots of Mexican places. Too bad. Rick Bayless's brilliant renditions of regional Mexican cuisine are by now the stuff of international legend, and these two vibrant, art-filled attached restaurants with their separate kitchens and menus are among Chicago's cultural gems.</p>
        <p>Topolobampo is a tiny room (46 seats) offering a concise monthly menu of dazzlingly sophisticated yet authentic Mexican cooking, sometimes featuring cuisines from specific regions such as Michoacan or Oaxaca. Wines are chosen to match the strong, complex sauces, and it's a good idea to ask Larry Butcher, the maitre d'hotel, for his recommendations from the quirky, expensive bottle and glass list. For my most recent meal, a Martinez Bujanda Conde de Valdemar Grand Reserva (1987) from Rioja for $36 made a wonderful pairing.</p>
        <p>At Topolobampo, meals might start with burros de huitlacoche -- fresh tortillas filled with black corn fungus and served with smoky Oaxacan chili pasilla salsa -- or a punchy soup of quelites greens (a plant also known as lamb's quarters) and chili pasado with caramelized onions, roasted parsnips and tomatoes. Main courses are called platillos fuertes (bold plates) and they are bold: Rabbit in a creamy sauce of smoky chipotle chilies with a tortilla casserole and braised greens; or marinated mahi-mahi baked in banana leaves with the anise-like herb hoja santa, tomatoes, chili guero and sweet plantains, all served with very spicy seared chili serrano salsa. For a fittingly exotic dessert, there might be a crust made with popped amaranth seeds filled with cajeta (goat's milk caramel) cream, with black zapote sauce (the fruit of the chewing-gum tree), almond praline and chocolate shards.</p>
        <p>The adjacent Frontera Grill is a more spacious, more informal room with a wide-ranging menu of small and large regional dishes. On a recent visit, the day's tamales were filled with lamb and swathed in chipotle chili-tomato sauce. Salpicon de camarones was a lively salad of big grilled shrimp served with avocado, chilies, fresh Mexican cheese and white and sweet potatoes (Bayless prefers indigenous potatoes to rice as a starch). Our well-informed waiter said that the terrific raisin-studded sauce on the special duck breast entree was made with complex-tasting chilies chilhuacles, which are rarely seen outside of Oaxaca, ''but Bayless and the staff were visiting there the other day so we brought some back.'' Garlic-marinated lamb leg served with bacon, spicy manzano chilies and grilled red onions reminded me of a rustic French braised dish filtered through a Mexican sensibility.</p>
        <p>Here, too, desserts are unusual and delicious: sour-cherry mango pie with almond crumb topping and buttermilk vanilla ice cream, and flan with tiny Michigan wild raspberries. Besides a big selection of Mexican beers and the great regular margaritas, shaken tableside, there is a wild mescal margarita made with smooth, smoky-tasting, triple-distilled Encantando mescal and Don Pedro brandy.</p>
        <p>Printer's Row</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago, Michael Foley was a pioneer in the revitalization of the old Printer's Row neighborhood just south of the Loop with his innovative New American restaurant. The clubby, subdued space, with its white tablecloths simply set with pewter plates looks slightly worn on the edges now, but what has been lost in freshness is made up in genteel character. It's the kind of place where you'd expect to see, as we have, Senator Paul Simon, complete with bow tie, dining sedately.</p>
        <p>The food is much more adventurous than the look, as the chef de cuisine, Mary Ellen Diaz, keeps to Foley's robust, creative approach  with some new Asian touches that usually -- but not always -- work. A bracing starter of aquavit-cured salmon absolutely shimmers over a complementary wheatberry and cucumber salad. Calamari slow simmered with oranges and tomatoes then quickly sauteed are served at the peak of tenderness with arugula, caramelized onion, and tomato-orange salsa. But Thai chicken vegetable soup flavored with lemongrass and miso misses the mark; the broth is dull and the chicken tough.</p>
        <p>There is always a fine nightly venison special, recently grilled slices of rare venison loin served over artichoke and chanterelle ragout with Parmesan grits and an almost translucent beer-based sauce. Grilled swordfish topped with grapefruit in a well-made soy citrus vinaigrette is paired with a wasabi-flavored rice cake. Asian accents also shine in the grilled five-spice seasoned duck breast served with red pepper sauce, wild mushroom couscous, and stir-fried baby bok choy and shiitakes.</p>
        <p>By comparison, desserts disappointed. A special gingered black plum-black cherry crunch was ruined by a dollop of ice cream that was billed as cardamom but tasted more like medicinal cough drops than the authentic spice. The strawberry-rhubarb oatmeal crumble cake fared better. From a well-chosen mostly domestic wine list I tried a Guenoc Lake County California Petite Sirah (1992) for $30 that did justice to the venison and duck.</p>
        <p>Tuttaposto</p>
        <p>The name of this restaurant, which is billed as a ''Mediterranean taverna'' by the chef-owner, Tony Mantuano, is Italian slang for ''everything's copacetic''. This casual place, which seats about 150 people,  vibrates to the rumble of the elevated-train tracks. The color-splashed industrial rehabbed interior is outfitted in abstract murals, Moroccan fabrics and metallic-hued tabletops under high-tech lighting. On the back of the menu is a glossary of esoteric Mediterranean foods: skordalia, harissa, gremolata, taleme, zhoug -- useful because the kitchen covers  territory from Gibraltar to Gallipoli. The cooking accentuates the healthy side with unusual grains and condiments, and when the menu says ''spicy,'' be forewarned.</p>
        <p>A multi-ethnic tasting menu can be constructed out of the flavor-packed appetizers. A plate of grilled calamari and octopus seasoned with garlic and oregano with garlic pita is irresistible, as is spicy garlic shrimp flamed tableside with ouzo. Real Italian tastes come through in the wood-roasted thin-crust pizzas and pastas such as triangola -- big triangle ravioli filled with garlicky roast chicken, served with cherry tomatoes, pancetta and asparagus.</p>
        <p>Main courses continue the theme: aromatic couscous is served with half a squab, tahini-marinated chicken, a skewer of juicy lamb and a coil of housemade Moroccan merguez sausage -- a gorgeous feast for one. On the milder side, a lightly wood-roasted salmon fillet with pesto and bell pepper oil is served with potato puree and green beans. Kids 9 and under eat free Sunday 5 to 7 P.M., and the juicy grilled chicken breast with rosemary potato chips is so good you'll filch from your own child.</p>
        <p>Among beautifully fashioned desserts is Pharaoh's chocolate, a dramatic pyramid of dark chocolate and praline filled with chocolate mousse, dribbled with berry sauce. A dense and fruity unfiltered dry Greek red wine from Megas Oenos (1993) at $33 made a fittingly hearty accompaniment to Tony Mantuano's food.</p>
        <p>Great meals for Democrats (Republicans, too)</p>
