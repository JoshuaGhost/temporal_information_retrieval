        <p>Jack Youngerman  Glenn Horowitz Bookseller, 87 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. To Aug. 19. 324-5511</p>
        <p>A decade after Jack Youngerman's retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum, it is clear that the strong, appealing, post-painterly abstraction he represents has a solid place in history, even in the wake of the radically different avant-gardes that have been commanding attention.</p>
        <p>The research into the essentials of shape, color and perception, begun in the early 1950's by Mr. Youngerman, Ellsworth Kelly and others, is fundamental to subsequent developments in painting.</p>
        <p>By concentrating on small paintings on paper from 1951 through 1981, this sizable show spread through two galleries manages to cover a lot. It also updates the artist's career with a bronze and two aluminum sculptures that demonstrate his current avenues for exploring ways of turning contour into content.</p>
        <p>It is the paintings, however, with their probing color interactions, that present the best insight. Each crisp and sharp configuration generally uses just one or two colors plus black and white, but combinations are selected for their resonance and can border on the voluptuous.</p>
        <p>Limiting color range is effective in emphasizing the contours that are always such a primary source of visual energy for Mr. Youngerman.  Forms that push, shove and vibrate also produce energy, as does the cropping of a vibrant shape at the paper's edge.</p>
        <p>Shapes sometimes seem to be influenced by nature and have irregular edges that make each minuscule variation important. At other moments they are strictly mental inventions.</p>
        <p>Such contrasts become part of the impact and serve as reminders that the power of form is paramount here.  Perceptual impact is often augmented, too, by contrasts in the character of the stroke and by an occasional mirror image.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, the one thing better than galleries filled with Youngerman is a room with a single Youngerman. When concentration is encouraged, it tests the potential for hypnotic intensity that is present in many examples.</p>
        <p>Esteban Vicente: Painting and Collage</p>
        <p>Lizan-Tops Gallery 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. To Aug. 27.  324-3424.</p>
        <p>Esteban Vicente has explored a number of approaches to abstraction in his long career. Each phase usually included some original, dynamic punch that was right for the particular investigation. The current sizable show concentrates on the last 15 years, a period when the paintings have centered on the evocative experience that can be created by the movement and interaction of inventive color configurations. A thin paint surface allows the maximum resonant light field. Frequently the forms have hazy edges that visually dissolve into adjacent areas and produce a mesmerizing glow. Colors tend to be soft, although they function with considerable strength since they carry the total weight of defining the work.</p>
        <p>Combining collages and paintings proves to be a good idea, for the arranagement process inherent in the abstract layered paper shapes heightens appreciation of the painting components as carefully weighed, in spite of their great freedoms. Rough, torn edges and the irregularities of handmade paper blend with pigment in the collages to create a variety of subtle sensations and textural effects. In one outstanding untitled example from 1991, at least eight different tones of white enrich the surface and test perception. Among the paintings, a large diptych, ''South Bank'' is particularly successful. Its dominant, suspended orange form spreads over both sections and generates a pronounced spatial tension. Notable, too, is the smaller ''Ayer,'' with its large undulating areas of a sensuous lime green.</p>
        <p>Mary Abbott/Balcomb Greene</p>
        <p>Arlene Bujese Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. To Aug. 22.  324-2823.</p>
        <p>The smashing array of assertive colors that suggest random sprays of mixed flowers in ''Chartres, Yellow Tulip'' is typical of the busily brushed canvases Mary Abbott has been exhibiting in recent years. Never really descriptive, these masses of brush strokes lie somewhere between nature and gestural action painting.</p>
        <p>It is Ms. Abbott's very large, new works that are the most successful examples here. ''Dak,'' inspired by an African forest, has a junglelike density, and ''Lucy'' experiments with fusing the rhythms of nature with those of the surrounding world.</p>
        <p>The late Balcomb Greene was a Montauk resident for decades and had several major local exhibitions.  Those who thought they were familiar with the artist's career are likely to be surprised by the quality and scope of his figure drawings from the early 1930's that are shown along with several good examples of the rather symbolic figure-by-the-sea paintings that were his concentration in the 70's and 80's.</p>
        <p>Made when Greene was living in Paris and attending life-drawing sessions, the drawings -- in various combinations of charcoal, watercolor, pencil and gouache -- have a direct and bold expressive character that is occasionally reminiscent of Rouault.</p>
        <p>Everything feels like an intense examination of gesture and emotion.  A special force comes from the way these studies blend subjective mood with a surface vibrancy that is most often augmented by colored shadows or by rubbing and blurring definitions.</p>
        <p>Adjustments to natural body forms and an emphasis on developing design relationships hint at Greene's parallel interest in the pure abstraction that would establish his reputation within a few years.</p>
        <p>Most significantly, these 30's pieeces tend to clarify the merger of human and abstract elements in the later paintings of generalized bodies that are usually woven into an ambiguous, rocky setting. In ''Tanya,'' for example, there are pronounced contour adjustments that invent a surface with powerful flowing shapes.</p>
        <p>The Expressionist phase of Greene's career contrasts with and tends to underscore the depersonalized qualities he sought later.</p>
        <p>This is also noticeable in a group of figure drawings from the 60's that use more of his abstract sensibilities and ultimately seem more labored, especially in comparision with the vitality, movement and immediacy that he sought earlier.</p>
