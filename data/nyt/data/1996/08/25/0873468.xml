        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding Phil Gailey's review of ''Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater'' (Aug. 4): a more perfect illustration of my book's theme could hardly have appeared in your pages had I written it myself.</p>
        <p>Here's what the book says: '' 'The most sacred cow of the press,' the late George Seldes used to say, 'is the press itself.' Reporters who pore over politicians' words with the rapt attention of an I.R.S. auditor scrutinizing a bookie's tax return -- searching out inconsistencies, gaffes, flip-flops, anything they can call 'news' -- recoil in horror at their own work getting anything like the same treatment. Hence Whitewater.''</p>
        <p>My book alleges no conspiracy other than the self-aggrandizement of reporters whose practices -- carefully documented in every instance -- no conscientious journalist can openly defend. Hence, I think, the undertone of panic in Mr. Gailey's review. Unable to contradict even a single episode in ''Fools for Scandal,'' he resorts to calling it ''a nasty book'' and ''a smear job'' because ''it assaults the integrity'' of reporters who have made a career out of flogging Whitewater.</p>
        <p>Apparently readers are to take it on faith that name brand journalists, alone among mortals, are above suspicion and beyond reproach. All of which underlines a conclusion I came to early on in my research: If somebody came up with a Crybaby Award for the ability to dish it out but not take it, our nation's vaunted Washington press corps would soon retire the trophy.</p>
