        <p>When a guest ordered a strawberry daiquiri at the century-old Claremont Hotel recently, the bartender did something so simple it was downright startling: he retrieved fresh strawberries from the refrigerator, then gently washed and stemmed them by hand before dropping them into the blender.</p>
        <p>Mount Desert Island, on the Maine coast about 36 miles southeast of Bangor, has long been a place of small gestures and simple charms. It's been that way since the mid-19th century, when Thomas Cole and Frederick Church prowled the island for landscapes to paint and brought back images of a restless sea against a backdrop of rugged mountains. Attracted by that craggy grandeur, affluent urbanites soon followed, building oceanside mansions and remarkable mountain paths.</p>

        <p>When a guest ordered a strawberry daiquiri at the century-old Claremont Hotel recently, the bartender did something so simple it was downright startling: he retrieved fresh strawberries from the refrigerator, then gently washed and stemmed them by hand before dropping them into the blender.</p>
        <p>Mount Desert Island, on the Maine coast about 36 miles southeast of Bangor, has long been a place of small gestures and simple charms. It's been that way since the mid-19th century, when Thomas Cole and Frederick Church prowled the island for landscapes to paint and brought back images of a restless sea against a backdrop of rugged mountains. Attracted by that craggy grandeur, affluent urbanites soon followed, building oceanside mansions and remarkable mountain paths.</p>
        <p>Today the most dramatic terrain is preserved within the borders of Acadia National Park, (207) 288-5456, which makes up nearly half the island. Within the park are extraordinary oceanside drives, challenging hiking trails and peaceful carriage roads and two National Parks Service campgrounds, all of which offer access to sea, spruce and granite landscapes that have been largely unchanged since Cole and Church painted them.</p>
        <p>Which isn't to say that the island has gone untouched by the present century. The park gets some three million visitors each summer, trespassing rather heavily on the serenity of the place. Bar Harbor, the  commercial center, has more than its share of shops selling lobster key chains and puffin T-shirts. In August sidewalks can be obstacle courses.</p>
        <p>But the pockets of tranquillity are never far from the crush -- in the island's smaller towns, like Northeast Harbor and picturesque Bass Harbor; aboard a ferry to an offshore island; or, most simply, on a trip into the woods by foot or bike.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>People wearing white and hefting mallets will compete in the 20th annual Claremont Classic croquet tournament on the grounds of the Claremont Hotel. The finals are Aug. 10, followed by an outdoor buffet and dance with a Dixieland jazz band for about $17. Call (207) 244-5036.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 12, the Arcady Music Festival, (207) 288-3151, presents ''Marimba Magic,'' starring Mutsuko Taneya, a Japanese marimba virtuoso. The concert is at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor and features works by Mendelssohn, Bach and Copland, among others. Tickets are $12 in advance, $15 at the door.</p>
        <p>The Acadia Repertory Theater, (207) 244-7260, now in its 24th year, will stage Agatha Christie's ''Murder at the Vicarage'' Aug. 13 to Sept. 1, at the Masonic Hall in the Village of Somesville on the island's west side. Tickets are $14.</p>
        <p>One of Maine's most popular and oldest country fairs takes place Aug. 29 to Sept. 2 in Blue Hill, on the mainland about 25 miles west of Mount Desert. The fair features agricultural exhibits, carnival rides and the Joie Chitwood Auto Thrill Show. Tickets are $5, $3 for seniors; children 12 and under are free. Call (207) 374-9976 for information.</p>
        <p>The Criterion Theater, (207) 288-3441, in downtown Bar Harbor, makes moviegoing seem once again like a big night out. Built in 1932, the theater still has much of its magnificent Art Deco styling intact. Splurge for seats in the loges at $1 extra.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The sunrise from Cadillac Mountain, the island's highest peak at 1,530 feet and reachable by car, ranks among the most popular sights on Mount Desert, but a number of other pursuits take place at more civilized hours.</p>
        <p>Visitors can put the island into its coastal context with a glider flight high above the granite hills. Flights are offered daily from the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport, with a pilot taking up to two passengers at a time. The basic ride lasts about 20 minutes and costs $80 for two; (207) 667-7627.</p>
        <p>The 20-mile Park Loop Road is Acadia National Park's equivalent of Yellowstone's Old Faithful or Yosemite's El Capitan -- the centerpiece that draws teeming crowds, and with good reason. The loop is worth at least two trips: once for the sheer exhilaration of the changing vistas from the swooping road, and again to stop and explore attractions like Sand Beach and Thunder Hole, an oceanside cavern that explodes concussively when the waves wash in (it's most theatrical in the middle of a rising tide). A weeklong pass costs $5 a vehicle.</p>
        <p>Mount Desert (pronounced duh-ZERT) has some 120 miles of hiking trails, and the best of them feature all the drama of hiking above the tree line in New Hampshire's White Mountains with only a fraction of the effort in getting there. Expect great views and sunny rock ledges fringed with blueberry and juniper bushes.</p>
        <p>The premier view of Somes Sound and the islands to the south is from atop Acadia Mountain on the island's west side. The round-trip loop hike is about 2.5 miles, with the steep ascent and descent linked by a broad, open summit. Among the most impressive island trails for sheer bravado are the Ladder Trail up the east side of Dorr Mountain and the Beehive Trail near Sand Beach. Both were built early in this century, and employ extraordinary stone steps and iron ladders to get hikers up the demanding rock faces.</p>
        <p>When John D. Rockefeller Jr. wanted a place to take his horses after noisy automobiles invaded the island, he built a 57-mile network of graceful carriage trails. The route has been extensively restored in the past few years and is ideal for cruising by mountain bike. Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop, (207) 288-3886, rents mountain bikes with locks and helmets for $14 a day, and is open until 8 P.M., longer than the other bike shops in the area.</p>
        <p>The remote and rural Swans Island is accessible by ferry from Bass Harbor. It's $9 round trip; mountain bikes may be reserved in advance for touring the island at $16 a day. Call (207) 288-9605 for reservations. Ferries leave Northeast Harbor for the tiny Cranberry Isles, where you can stop by the quirky Isleford Historical Museum. Contact Beal and Bunker, (207) 244-3575, or Isleford Ferry, (207) 276-3717, for ferry schedules.</p>
        <p>Also in Northeast Harbor are the exceptional Thuya Gardens, (207) 276-5130, a semiformal perennial garden designed by Charles K. Savage on a secluded forested hillside.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The Claremont, (800) 244-5036, fax (207) 244-3512, on five acres overlooking Somes Sound in Southwest Harbor, has been taking in guests since 1884. About half of the 24 rooms in the main building offer exceptional water views, and there is a veranda with rockers. Activities include jigsaw puzzles, biking around town, and drinks at the boathouse before dinner (jackets requested for men). High season rates are $192 double, including breakfast and dinner. Guest rooms have fans but no air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>The comfortable Acadia Hotel, (207) 288-5721, no fax, was built in 1884 across from the village green and is one of the best situated of the Bar Harbor B and B's. Most of the 10 guest rooms, some of which are quite small, have recently been renovated with an aggressive floral motif, and all have private baths. Peak season rates, including breakfast, are $79 to $95 for two.</p>
        <p>Budget: Five miles northwest of Bar Harbor in Hulls Cove is the Colony, (207) 288-3383 or (800) 524-1159, no fax, a classic motor court with 55 white cottages arrayed in rows so lengthy you first suspect an elaborate optical illusion. It's well situated across from the cove, and rooms are $50 to $90 for two.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Balance Rock Inn in Bar Harbor, (207) 288-2610 or (800) 753-0494, fax (207) 288-5534, occupies one of the island's grand shingled cottages, built at the water's edge in 1903. The inn was expanded last year, but the changes didn't interfere with its stellar views. Amenities include a heated pool overlooking Frenchman Bay, and a fitness center. High-season doubles: $195 to $425 including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Two miles outside of town is the Inn at Canoe Point, (207) 288-9511, fax (207) 288-2870, an intimate five-room B and B with a continental flair. This elegantly styled cliffside inn, near the park entrance, feels far more remote than its location (just off busy Route 3) would suggest. Doubles: $125 to $225, with full breakfast.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Jordan Pond House, (207) 276-3316, in Acadia Park has been an island tradition for more than a century. Although the original rustic lodge burned 17 years ago, it's still worth a stop for tea and popovers late in the afternoon, with a view up the pond if the weather is suitable. Afternoon tea costs $11 for two.</p>
        <p>Popular Abel's Lobster Pound, (207) 276-5827, on Somes Sound five miles north of Northeast Harbor, is set among tall, peaceful pines overlooking the water; diners can enjoy their lobsters seated at glossy green picnic tables beneath the trees or in an enclosed dining room. Dinner for two runs about $50 with drinks.</p>
        <p>Restaurant XYZ, (207) 244-5221, across from the town dock in Manset (near Southwest Harbor), serves uncommonly earthy Mexican food made with zesty ingredients like chipoltes and habaneros. The motel-restaurant interior is uninspired at best, but the food is a far cry from the bland Mexican fare found too often in New England. Entrees include chicken breast served with a delicious homemade mole sauce, and pork loin baked with a sauce of guajillo and ancho chiles. Dinner for two, including a couple of fresh-lime margaritas, is about $50.</p>
        <p>In Bar Harbor, George's Restaurant, 7 Stephens Lane, (207) 288-4505, serves some of the region's best dinners from a cozy bungalow hidden a half-block off Main Street. Lamb is the specialty, prepared in any number of ways. Also good is the smoky paella and the rich lobster strudel. Dinner for two with wine is about $100. Ask for directions.</p>
        <p>For deftly prepared local seafood served with fresh organic vegetables, head to the Burning Tree, (207) 288-9331, in Otter Creek, on Route 3 midway between Bar Harbor and Northeast Harbor. Purists stick with the basic grilled fish; the spicy gumbo or lobster and crab au gratin are good choices, too. Dinner for two with wine is about $70.</p>
        <p>Freshly brewed beer is on tap at the Lompoc Cafe and Brewpub, 36 Rodick Street in Bar Harbor, (207) 288-9392, which also has a creative pub menu that includes chicken breast with sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese and Cuban black beans with stir-fried veggies. Dinner for two is $35 with a couple of pints.</p>
        <p>Fine cheap meals are found at Jordan's Restaurant, (207) 288-3586,  80 Cottage Street in Bar Harbor. You can order the exceptional pancakes until closing at 2 P.M. Lunch or breakfast is under $10 for two.</p>
