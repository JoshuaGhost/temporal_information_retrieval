        <p>Authorities in Long Beach, New York, carry on running battle with Jack Toback, who violates noise ordinances with bullhorn preachings about Jesus Christ and sin on Long Beach boardwalk (S)</p>

        <p>IT'S a sunny Sunday afternoon, so Jack Toback is exercising his First Amendment rights on the boardwalk. At 1:30, he parks himself at National Boulevard, near the concession stands. The police arrive a little later.</p>
        <p>After what happened the last time, Mr. Toback leaves his microphone and speakers home. Instead, he carries a bullhorn. But it's no use. He is halfway into his two-hour sermon on the powers of Jesus Christ and the wages of sin when an officer, one of the regulars, walks over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toback receives his 13th ticket this summer for violating the Long Beach noise ordinance. If he doesn't simmer down, the cop with the decibel meter tells him, he'll get arrested in 30 minutes, just like the last time. Mr. Toback does not stop. But after 30 minutes, he packs up. ''I didn't feel like getting arrested,'' he says. ''That could take five hours out of my day.''</p>
        <p>The battle between Jack Toback, 51, and the city of Long Beach (pop. 35,000) is like a long-running play. Every Sunday, weather permitting, and for three days running on holiday weekends, Mr. Toback takes center stage at the busiest spot on the boardwalk. Three or four police officers act as foils. They lean against the railings with their decibel meter, making sure Mr. Toback's free speech does not cost the public peace.</p>
        <p>This drama has toured Federal court, city court and the pages of the local newspapers for three years. It first gained notoriety when Mr. Toback sued Long Beach for banning microphones and bullhorns in public places. He won. Eventually, the city wrote a new comprehensive noise ordinance, which became effective at the end of May. It places a limit on public speech at 65 decibels, a limit officials say Mr. Toback regularly ignores. Last Sunday, he was ticketed for preaching at 82.4 decibels, shouting level.</p>
        <p>ED EATON, the Long Beach City Manager, says the city has been forced to monitor Mr. Toback because so many people complain about him. On the Fourth of July, when the calls came in at a dizzying pace, Mr. Toback received seven tickets.</p>
        <p>''People are quite incensed about the whole thing,'' Mr. Eaton said. One day, he recalled, Mr. Toback was attacked by a 50-year-old accountant on a bicycle. The cyclist plowed into Mr. Toback, grabbed him by the neck and screamed for him to leave. ''When a law-abiding accountant is driven to do something like this, you know there is frustration,'' Mr. Eaton said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Toback insists he is not the loudest person on the boardwalk. ''They say it's the noise,'' he said. ''But the truth of the matter is, it's not the noise. It's the message.''</p>
        <p>Women constantly tell him the posters he displays of fetuses during an abortion are disgusting, he said. ''I tell them I agree. And then I ask if they're against abortion. And they say 'no.' So I tell them the blood of these babies is on their hands.''</p>
        <p>Jews, he said, are also offended by him. ''There are a lot of Jewish people in Long Beach, and they don't like my preaching,'' he said. ''Sometimes I get Jews come up to me and call me a traitor. I say, I'll be Jewish until the day I die, but Jesus entered my life 12 years ago and everything changed.''</p>
        <p>MR. TOBACK, who lives in Long Beach, says he has no problem preaching elsewhere. On Mondays and Tuesdays, he preaches across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, on one of the noisiest, busiest streets in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>He is trying to challenge Long Beach in Federal court to force it to prove why 65 decibels is its limit. But 65 decibels, or conversational level at roughly three feet away, is the standard, said Eric Zwerling, the director of the Noise Technical Assistance Center at Rutgers University, which helps municipalities across the country write noise ordinances. ''At 65 decibels, anyone who wants to hear you, can hear you,'' he said. But it does not force those who don't want to listen to hear.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Toback, however, this is persecution. ''No one else is monitored like I am,'' he said. Last week, he was in city court to answer disorderly conduct charges. He is due back in court Sept. 12. ''This,'' he said, ''is what what they did to the Apostles.''</p>
