        <p>There are more than 15,000 Avon ladies in Russia, and not one of them rings the doorbell.</p>
        <p>Bowing both to security fears and old-time Soviet etiquette, Russian representatives of the world's largest direct-sales cosmetics company do not go door to door. They do not even make house calls to established customers. Instead, they sell lipsticks, wrinkle creams and facial toners in factories, airports, beauty parlors, laboratories and, sometimes, from a park bench.</p>
        <p>''Russians are afraid to open their door to strangers,'' explained Mariya Gerasyova, 31, the company's national sales director. ''And even if they know you, they don't want you to see how their apartments look, the lack of repair, the dirt.''</p>
        <p>But Russian women have swept aside almost every other cultural inhibition to embrace the latest capitalist profit notion sweeping the Russian economy -- direct-sales marketing. Avon Products Inc. of New York and its main rival, Mary Kay Cosmetics, a unit of the Mary Kay Corporation of Dallas, have invaded the Russian market the last two years and recruited an all-female army to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of beauty products each year.</p>
        <p>And Russia -- with its swelling rolls of unemployed or underemployed professionals -- is a recruiter's dream. Thousands of women trained as engineers, physicists and teachers are grabbing an entrepreneurial opportunity that even five years ago was both illegal and socially taboo.</p>
        <p>''The professional qualifications of these women are unbelievable,'' declared Susan Kropf, president for new and emerging markets at Avon, on her first visit to Russia last month. ''When the first Russian coordinator I met told me she was a surgeon, I fell out of my chair.'' Mrs. Gerasyova, similarly, is a trained linguist and a reserve lieutenant in the Russian Army.</p>
        <p>As a result of their new-found wealth and independence, the lives of many of these newly minted entrepreneurs have undergone a more radical make-over than had taken place during the collapse of the Soviet Union five years ago. ''When I started, my husband was always furious,'' said Svetlana Morosova, 29, an area manager for Avon. She sat at a table in the Avon sales office in Moscow with a dozen other managers and sales coordinators. All of them were elegantly turned out in muted pastel business suits. And all of them nodded knowingly.</p>
        <p>''He couldn't stand the fact that I was making more money then him, that I had changed, become more self-assured and independent,'' she said.  Her husband, a policeman, earns less than $200 a month.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mrs. Morosova, who has advanced degrees in mathematics and economics, was sitting at home with her twins, a boy and a girl who are now 4 years old, struggling to find part-time accounting work when a friend introduced her to Avon. She made her first sale to other young mothers at a children's playground.</p>
        <p>She is now a manager, a job that pays close to $2,000 a month in a country where the average salary is $120. She drives a company car, a beige Russian-made Zhiguli. Her mother baby-sits for her children, and unlike many Russian marriages that have been torn apart by the wife's sudden financial success, hers has survived. Her husband ''has even learned to cook,'' she said to the laughter of her colleagues.</p>
        <p>If many Russian women view the American cosmetics industry as an economic godsend, the industry is embracing Russia -- with a population of about 150 million hungry for Western-style goods -- as a marketing paradise.</p>
        <p>For Avon, which is already active throughout Europe, Russia is one of several hot emerging markets, which also include China, South Africa and Latin America.</p>
        <p>It started off gingerly in 1993, having been burned in an ill-fated bid to enter the Soviet market in the early 1980's, and at first it sold its products through stores. But last year, Avon began full-scale direct sales. It has already signed up 16,000 sales representatives in Moscow, St. Petersburg and the Siberian town of Perm and expects $30 million in revenue this year, up from $9 million in 1995. John Law, Avon's general manager in Moscow, says its long-term plan is to ''sell a lot of lipstick.'' Ms. Kropf, the marketing executive, calls the country ''Avon heaven.''</p>
        <p>For Mary Kay, which has less experience in emerging markets, the former Soviet Union is the focus of its overseas growth. It began its operations here in September 1993 and now has 25,000 representatives in Russia and the other former Soviet republics. The company had sales of $25 million in the region last year and expects to triple that figure in 1996.</p>
        <p>The American companies' penetration of Russia is all the more impressive given the country's 70 years of Communist indoctrination against private enterprise, which some people still refer to as ''speculation.'' ''For the older generation, selling is still viewed as shameful,'' Mrs. Gerasyova, Avon's national sales director, said. But another Soviet tradition played against that constraint: when shortages were acute, many women lined up for hours, bought in bulk and privately bartered cosmetics for meat, perfume for diapers. ''We took it easy at first, contacting friends and relatives, the way it was always done,'' Mrs. Gerasyova explained.</p>
        <p>Avon, which had overall sales last year of $4.5 billion, and Mary Kay, which had revenue of $950 million in 1995, are following slightly different pricing and marketing approaches in Russia. Avon representatives buy Avon products on credit, then resell them to friends, acquaintances and co-workers at a recommended retail price, pocketing a difference that averages 20 percent. They do not have to pay any cash up front. Prices of Avon cosmetics are lower than many popular European brands found in Russian stores. A lipstick costs $5.16, a moisturizing cleanser, $5.79.</p>
        <p>Mary Kay representatives, who call themselves ''skin care consultants,'' have to buy start-up demonstration product kits for $85. Their selling efforts focus on a free makeup and skin-care lesson, and they earn commissions of 20 to 40 percent on prices that range from $12 for a cleanser to $18.75 for a moisturizer.</p>
        <p>A single purchase can take a big cut out of an average Russian woman's income, but many customers say they do not care. Natasha Matyonina, 28, a mother of one who earns less than $500 a month as a baby sitter, said she considers the Avon products she buys as necessities. ''I can go without a lot of things, but I can't imagine not having makeup,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The entrepreneurs who sell Avon and Mary Kay products enjoy advantages that the owners of larger, more visible businesses lack. For one thing, their tiny, home-based ventures can easily escape the notice of tax collectors (though both companies say they instruct their representatives to register with the tax authorities). Better yet, they are unlikely to be detected by the mobsters and racketeers who demand protection money from cash businesses.</p>
        <p>At Avon's sales center in Moscow, training new representatives can seem a little like a pink-tinted Parris Island, the Marine training base in South Carolina. The novices huddle in pained shyness, their shabby clothes, florid makeup and awkward body language clashing with the sleek corporate look of company veterans. Within weeks, though, they emerge radiating the trademark poise of professional Avon ladies. ''They come to us like mice, and we turn them into firebirds,'' Mrs. Gerasyova said brightly.</p>
        <p>While not a single saleswoman said she considered herself a ''feminist'' -- a word with a sharply negative connotation in Russia -- all spoke enthusiastically of the self-reliance they had won and of the opportunity they had gained to commingle with like-minded women. ''This kind of independence has changed the way we live; it changes our relationship with men,'' said Tatyana Navrodskaya, a Mary Kay consultant. ''But it's not feminism. You can still remain feminine.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Navrodskaya, a high school drama teacher, was teaching an entirely different kind of class to three women in a spare room her Mary Kay team leader rented from a home for the blind in suburban Moscow.  Dingy walls were plastered with glossy pastel company posters and pictures of the company founder, Mary Kay Ash, improbably blond and dewy for a woman who is believed to be in her 70's (though she will not reveal her age). ''You don't think she's had a face lift?'' whispered one customer, as she studied the gauzy portrait. ''Come off it,'' her  friend retorted cynically. ''Have you seen my grandmother? Of course she's had a face lift.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Navrodskaya expertly shepherded all three women back to the subject -- the proper application of a walnut mask. An hour later, the women were giddily inspecting their buffed, polished and delicately painted faces. All three bought lipsticks, eyeshadow and cleansers.</p>
        <p>''We had good cosmetics in Soviet times, brands like Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent,'' one of the customers said, ''but you could never be sure to find it, there would be lines, shortages, and always, unpleasant sales people.''</p>
        <p>There are no longer lines or shortages of fancy cosmetics in big cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, but the prices are often too high for average women, and the service mostly remains as before -- icily indifferent. ''The idea that you can ask for advice or information about the product, and actually get it, that's amazing,'' one of the other customers said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Navrodskaya, who has three children, said the $300 to $400 she earns a month selling Mary Kay products in her spare time dwarfs her teacher's salary of $150, to say nothing of the $54 a month that her husband earns as a theater director. ''It has changed my life,'' she said simply. ''We simply could not survive were it not for this.''</p>
