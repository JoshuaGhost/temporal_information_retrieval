        <p>Ending a tense standoff between peacekeeping forces and Bosnian Serbs, NATO military inspectors today toured the sprawling mountainside compound here that served as the central command for the Bosnian Serb army during the four years of war.</p>
        <p>After an all-day inspection through the compound's kitchens, barracks and an underground bunker believed to be the headquarters for the Bosnian Serb military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of NATO ground forces in Bosnia declared the visit a success.</p>
        <p>''There was no door that was locked to us,'' the NATO commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Walker, said by telephone from Sarajevo this evening. ''We have sent a message to them that their incessant minor infractions are causing people's patience to run out.''</p>
        <p>General Walker conceded that a possible reason the Bosnian Serbs would not let a team of NATO inspectors enter the site last weekend -- in violation of the peace accord signed in Dayton, Ohio, last year -- could be that General Mladic, who is under indictment by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, was there at the time.</p>
        <p>''It certainly could have been that General Mladic was there,'' he said. ''But it could equally have been that the soldier at the front gate, responsible for protecting the headquarters, just hadn't been given orders'' to let the inspectors in.</p>
        <p>The site emerged as a serious point of contention between the Bosnian Serb military and the peacekeeping forces on Saturday, when NATO officials were denied permission to enter the complex, about 40 miles northeast of Sarajevo, as part of regular inspections of military sites around Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Saying they would use force if necessary, international military leaders pulled their troops from isolated checkpoints inside Serb-controlled territory on Monday afternoon and advised civilian aid workers to leave as well, apparently trying to reduce the chance that hostages could be taken.</p>
        <p>The Bosnian Serb political leaders backed down later Monday, and General Walker toured the site on Mount Zep outside this small Serb-held town with a group of mostly American inspectors for about eight hours today.</p>
        <p>As a result, he said that the NATO troops would return to their normal posts by midnight tonight. Workers with civilian organizations, and particularly more than 500 unarmed police officers sent in by the United Nations, also returned to Serb territory today.</p>
        <p>NATO's show of resolve over its right to inspect General Mladic's headquarters contrasted with its clear unwillingness to hunt down the general himself.</p>
        <p>''There could have been the fringe benefit if he was there,'' said one European diplomat, who also raised concern about NATO's decision to press the inspection issue just a month before the Bosnian elections considered crucial to moving forward with the peace plan are scheduled to be held.</p>
        <p>Maj. Brett Boudreau, a spokesman for the international peacekeeping forces here, repeated NATO's position on the question of arresting individuals indicted for war crimes: that NATO's political governing body has not given soldiers the order to search out indicted people, though it must arrest any individuals they may come across in the course of duty.</p>
        <p>General Walker, who is British, was accompanied in the inspection today by the Bosnian Serb's acting President, Biljana Plavsic, and was escorted around the complex by Gen. Milan Gevero, whom the United States military described as the chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army.</p>
        <p>General Walker and other military officials said they found nothing at the site, massed around a mountain nearly 5,000 feet high, that would violate the Dayton accords.</p>
        <p>There were no weapons caches, an official said, but the site was still populated with soldiers and contained medical buildings, gardens and motor pools, as well as General Mladic's underground bunker, which the official would not describe.</p>
