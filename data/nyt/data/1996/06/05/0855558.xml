        <p>The Kimberly-Clark Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to license its Scotties facial tissue brand in the United States and to sell a tissue mill  in New York to Irving Tissue Inc. The sale is intended to satisfy antitrust issues related to Kimberly-Clark's $9.4 billion acquisition of the Scott Paper Company. Terms were not disclosed. Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark, which was required by the Justice Department to license the Scotties brand and to sell up to two tissue mills by Sunday, said it had asked the department to extend the deadline to July 12 and to accept the sale of the mill in Fort Edward as satisfying its requirement. Irving Tissue is part of the Irving family of businesses, which is based in St. John, New Brunswick.</p>
