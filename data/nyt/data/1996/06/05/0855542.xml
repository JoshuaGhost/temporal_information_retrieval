        <p>U.S. Investigates Citibank Role in Mexican Deals Through an elaborate series of transfers involving Citibank, Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of the then-President of Mexico, whisked more than $80 million  out of Mexico in 1993 and into Switzerland.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of the deals involving Mr. Salinas, who is imprisoned in Mexico, to determine whether Citibank or others violated laws that prohibit banks from knowingly helping criminals hide illicit gains. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Orders Recalls; Chrysler Balks  The Transportation Department ordered a recall of most 1995-model Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus cars, saying their rear seat belts were not strong enough. But Chrysler, defending the belts, refused to recall the cars; the Government filed suit. [A14.]</p>
        <p>A $150 million award against G.M. by an Alabama jury to a man who was thrown from his Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and was paralyzed has brought calls both for tort reform and for an investigation of the auto maker's handling of faulty door latches. [A18.]</p>
        <p>Insurers Continue Consolidation  The insurance industry continued to move toward consolidation, as First Colony,  a major life insurance company, said it was considering a sale, and IPC Holdings, a large Bermuda-based reinsurance broker, bid nearly $1 billion to buy one of its competitors, Tempest Reinsurance. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Allstate said it would reorganize its property insurance business in Florida, where Hurricane Andrew inflicted $16.5 billion of damage on homeowners four years ago, to limit its liability in future disasters. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft Guns for the Internet  Microsoft said it would deploy an array of Internet software services, code-named Normandy, to establish a beachhead in the Internet market. Compuserve, which is to be the first big user of Normandy products, also will make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main Internet software it distributes on  its on-line service. [D8.]</p>
        <p>Factory Orders Eased in April  Factory orders eased by one-tenth of a percent in April to a seasonally adjusted level of $309.1 billion, after a revised increase of 1.7 percent in March. Aircraft sales were weak, but other goods, notably autos, were strong. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Ford Sales Increase 1.3%  Ford's domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.3 percent in May. Sales of Lincoln luxury cars and of the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar lagged, but light-truck sales were solid. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Retail Issues Pace Market Gain  Stocks advanced, buoyed by retailing issues and steadying interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41 points, to 5,665.71. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.95 points, to 1243.68. [D8.]</p>
        <p>Apple Plans Convertible Debt  Apple Computer said it would offer $575 million in convertible debt, in a move analysts termed positive. Treasury prices rose for the first time in three sessions, and the yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 7 percent. [D18.]</p>
        <p>$1.9 Billion Deal For Coke in Britain  Coca-Cola Enterprises agreed to buy the British bottling operations co-owned by  Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. for $1.9 billion. The deal continued the  company's European expansion. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which had a Dutch operation, bought French and Belgian units in May. [D5.]</p>
        <p>BellSouth and Time Warner in Link  BellSouth and Time Warner announced a deal to allow Time Warner to offer local telephone service in the Southeast. But while the Baby Bells -- Ameritech and Bell Atlantic have also announced deals -- eagerly portrayed the links as competitive milestones, analysts saw no guarantee of real competition. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Internet Guidelines Proposed  At an F.T.C. hearing, the on-line and direct marketing industries proposed voluntary guidelines to protect Internet users against unauthorized collection of personal data. Civil liberties groups were critical. [D19.]</p>
