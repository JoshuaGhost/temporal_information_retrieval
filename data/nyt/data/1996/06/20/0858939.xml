        <p>THE Great Hall of the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 66th Street  -- a skylighted gymnasium-like room that is more often the site of upper-crust diversions like the Winter Antiques Show -- has taken on the air of a souk. Interior designers are adding to the atmosphere by acting like flies, or at least dropping like them, in the unair-conditioned heat.</p>
        <p>The occasion is Bloomingdale's first sale of handmade Oriental rugs held outside the store.</p>
        <p>Wood pallets arranged in regimental formation are stacked knee- and waist-high with modern wool rugs from Pakistan, Egypt, Nepal and points beyond,  15,000 in all and priced 65 percent below retail. Available in sizes ranging from bath mat (3 by 3 feet) to ballroom (the largest measures 18 by 38 feet and  took 20 weavers five years to make) are pastel Versailles-style rugs, velvety Tibetan rugs in subtle Armani neutrals, gutsy geometric-pattern kilims from Mongolia, Indian carpets mimicking tiled gardens and even campy pictorials rugs  featuring drowsy rajahs leering at temptresses in harem pants.</p>
        <p>But the rug with the most notoriety is not for sale exactly. It is Lot 342 from the Sotheby auction of the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and it stands at the doors of the sale in a glass-and-wood display case. It was purchased for $43,125 by Paul Peykar, a rug manufacturer, and Robert Hakimi, a rug dealer. The Victorian needlepoint rug, which measures 8 feet by 7 feet 1 inch and is strewed with roses and hibiscus, was placed in the second-floor Oval Room of the White House by the designer Sister Parish. Copies can be ordered through Bloomingdale's in four sizes, ranging from 3 feet 9 inches by 5 feet 9 inches ($979) to 8 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 6 inches ($4,399). The reproductions will be available in May 1997, but the sale offers a preview.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Jane Stack was there to buy, not wax sentimental over relics of Camelot. For six months, Mrs. Stack and her decorator, Jane Kilpatrick, had been tramping the streets of New York, fabric swatches in hand, looking for the perfect floor covering for a children's room. Only nine days away from the due date for her second child, Mrs. Stack was goal oriented, and quite urgently so.</p>
        <p>"We've tried sisal, we've tried a light-colored carpet, and now we've decided to go for something Oriental and indestructible," Ms. Kilpatrick said. Becoming  more specific, she said she needed "a 9 by 12 that can survive two kids and two  pugs and doesn't cost more than $2,000." They found an Indian rug, 8 1/2 feet by 11 feet 9 inches, for $2,017.</p>
        <p>"Now we can get out of here," Mrs. Stack said with a sigh of relief.</p>
        <p>Hours: today and Friday, 10 A.M. to 8:30 P.M.; Saturday, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M., and Sunday, 11 A.M. to 7 P.M.</p>
