        <p>Gata Kamsky resigned the first game of his world title match with Anatoly Karpov yesterday without resuming play. The Brooklyn grandmaster was in a lost position when play broke off Thursday night and decided against prolonging his suffering.</p>
        <p>The match, held in Elista, the capital of the Russian Republic of Kalmykia, under the sponsorship of the International Chess Federation, will proceed until one player or the other tallies 10 1/2.</p>
        <p>In the final position, all the black pieces were too awkwardly placed to offer resistance to Karpov's plan of promoting his a pawn to a queen. One plausible finish would have been 57 Bd5 Rg4 58 Ra7 Kf6 59 a6 Rg1 60 Rd7 Nc8 61 Rc7 Ra1 62 Nb4 Ne7 63 a7 Nd5 64 Nd5 Ke5 65 Nb6.</p>
        <p>The game got under way with spunky opening play by Kamsky, who wanted to steer Karpov away from the slow-paced maneuvering he enjoys so much. But Karpov  solved the tricky problems thrown at him and painstakingly brought Kamsky's efforts to a halt.</p>
        <p>In the endgame, after Move 32, Kamsky must have regretted his eager advance with 25 . . . a4 because it was that pawn, out on a limb, that proved impossible to defend after 41 Nc5. And afterward, it was Karpov's passed a pawn that ruined the black position.</p>
        <p>Game 2 is to be played today.</p>
