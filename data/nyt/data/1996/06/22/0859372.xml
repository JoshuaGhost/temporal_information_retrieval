        <p>An 8-year-old Queens boy was killed in an apparent hit-and-run accident after his school bus dropped him off in Flushing yesterday.</p>
        <p>The police said that the boy, Jafkaran Dhillion, of 147-29 Hawthorne Avenue,  was struck by a car about 3 P.M. as he crossed Hawthorne Avenue near 149th Street. He had just stepped off the bus, the police said. The bus apparently had its flashing lights on, meaning other motorists are supposed to stop. The child  was pronounced dead at New York Hospital about a half-hour later.</p>

        <p>The police said they thought that the gray four-door sedan that struck the child, who attended Public School 22, was a livery cab, possibly a Ford or Lincoln.</p>
