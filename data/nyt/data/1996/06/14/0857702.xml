        <p>The old woman on the poster is dressed entirely in black. She is wrapped in the arms of the only person she feels certain can guide Russia safely from the abyss, and a prayer for deliverance brightens her dark eyes.</p>
        <p>"You are our last hope and support," the campaign ad says, referring to the mournful, empathetic, troubled man to whom she clings.</p>
        <p>Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the theatrical 50-year-old extremist who is seeking the Russian presidency again this year, loves that campaign poster.</p>
        <p>"This woman is Russia," he said recently, standing before one of the ads, which appear all across Moscow. "And I am Russia. And the people know it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhirinovsky has been written off as a harsh joke in every election since  1991, when he ran for President and came in third. He stunned the world in 1993  when his Liberal Democratic Party (not liberal, not democratic, hardly a party)  drew more votes in a parliamentary election than any other.</p>
        <p>Mining the anger of voters who feel cheated by President Boris N. Yeltsin's reforms and bitter about the grim legacy of Communism, he again did better than  anyone expected in parliamentary elections last December.</p>
        <p>And in the presidential election on Sunday, despite the broad belief that he  has finally yielded his niche as the poster boy for Russia's most disenfranchised and anguished voters, he nevertheless appears to have turned his neatest trick yet.</p>
        <p>The fiery loner who has physically attacked women on the floor of Parliament, who has promised to father a child in each of the former Soviet republics, who has referred to the American Congress as "Israeli-occupied territory" and who promises to "dump napalm on Chechnya" if he becomes President has suddenly become Russia's most unlikely new kingmaker.</p>
        <p>"If the Communists do well in the first round, then the backing of Zhirinovsky could present a lot of problems for Boris Yeltsin," said Igor Klyamkin, a leading liberal polltaker here, echoing the nearly universal view of his colleagues. "I don't think either of these people can really afford to ignore his supporters."</p>
        <p>That, of course, means that neither leading candidate can afford to ignore Mr. Zhirinovsky. If the race is close then his voters -- even if they are only 5 to 10 percent of the electorate -- could make the difference in a second round next month between Mr. Yeltsin and his Communist challenger, Gennadi A. Zyuganov.</p>
        <p>Early this year, Mr. Zyuganov said dismissively: "Zhirinovsky started running too early and too fast. By the time of the presidential elections he'll be out of breath."</p>
        <p>But not as tired as the Communist leader had hoped. Mr. Zyuganov sat down last week with the man he has often called a fool and a disgrace. Details of the horse-trading between them -- or between Mr. Zhirinovsky and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, whom he also saw last week -- have not been revealed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zhirinovsky has started to play games with both sides. After frequently dismissing democrats and Communists as two failed extremes, he has started to hold his tongue for the first time in memory.</p>
        <p>These days, when Mr. Zhirinovsky talks like a statesman, people have to listen, at least for a while.</p>
        <p>"We are holding a middle position," he told a crowd of nearly 3,000 admirers  in the center of Moscow on Wednesday at his last rally before the election. "Our people are tired of extremes, and we represent the force in the middle."</p>
        <p>The only thing more amazing about that statement coming from Mr. Zhirinovsky  is that to some degree, he is right. There is the bad Vlad ("Clinton deserves to suffer as much as have the Russian people") and the good Vlad.</p>
        <p>"Everyone calls me an enfant terrible," he said in an interview last week. "Did I turn tanks on my own parliament? Did I start a war in Chechnya that will  never end? Did I close this country's factories so that a few rich people could  have Mercedeses and foreign vacations? Somebody ought to look at the resume of the President and of the Communists who destroyed this country. Then come tell me how bad I am."</p>
        <p>Now there is the almost humorously cautious Vlad. "We were never Communists," he said at the rally on Wednesday. "I was never a member of the Communist Party," he said.</p>
        <p>"But we were never anti-Communists either," he continued. "There are millions of Communists who aren't guilty of a thing. Only the elites are guilty." He then accused Kremlin "plotters" of preventing him from having a personal meeting with Mr. Yeltsin this week.</p>
        <p>His message seems clear enough: I go to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>Depending on the outcome on Sunday, it is a strategy that may work well for Mr. Zhirinovsky. He has been having the time of his life lately by running up the middle.</p>
        <p>He has taken to wearing knee-length frock coats made for him by Slava Zaitzev, Russia's most famous designer. He alternates between a somber gray that makes him look like a young aide to Winston Churchill, a bright canary jacket that makes him look as if he just stepped off the cover of the Beatles' "Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," and a similar design made from blazing red linen that makes the other two seem demure.</p>
        <p>"It is time at the end of the century for Russia to be a stylish country," Mr. Zhirinovsky said recently when asked about what is going on with his wardrobe. "I feel I have a responsibility to look good."</p>
        <p>His public certainly loves him no less than ever.</p>
        <p>"I'm Russian," said Oleg Goryunov, a 26-year-old employee of Mars Candy company, which he described as a French company (but is in fact American, and one of Mr. Zhirinovsky's most hated symbols because it represents the cheap easy commercialism of America that he so despises).</p>
        <p>"There is no choice but Zhirinovsky. People in Moscow have gotten fat off Yeltsin -- but outside of Moscow, nobody will vote for him. Have you seen how they live there?"</p>
        <p>It is exactly that deep split between the haves of reform and the losers that first propelled Mr. Zhirinovsky to the front of the political pack. He makes simplistic promises -- "I will raise this country off its knees" was his main slogan in December -- but they work on emotional people.</p>
        <p>"Say whatever you like about him," said Svetlana I. Moyeva, 63, who says she  lost her job as a teacher because of "the end of the education system in our country. He is a man who cares about Russia. And we need him now more than we ever have."</p>
