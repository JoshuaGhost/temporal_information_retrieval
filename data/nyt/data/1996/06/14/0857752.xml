        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kenneth T. Jackson (Op-Ed, June 9) quotes Charles E. Merriam of the University of Chicago on his biblical understanding of Lot's wife. While heaven  is indeed pictured as a city, Sodom and Gomorrah were cities, too. Lot's problem was that he not only ignored the problems of the city but also contributed to them.</p>
        <p>Lot's wife looked back because her children were left behind; for this she died. The image of the heavenly city we can see ahead of us promoted an idealism and an abandonment of the real cities in which we lived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson's work would seem to favor the biblical Jeremiah, who called on  the faithful to stay and seek the welfare of the city. As for me, am I willing to be Lot's wife: to love and to die for the children of the city?</p>
