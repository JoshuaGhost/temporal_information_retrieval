        <p>In 1992, after nine stowaways were discovered by several members of the crew  of a Ukraine cargo ship sailing from Ghana, eight of the nine African men were murdered. Kingsley Ofosu survived to tell the story, vividly dramatized in "Deadly Voyage," which will have its premiere tomorrow night at 8.

Nobody wants them."</p>

        <p>In 1992, after nine stowaways were discovered by several members of the crew  of a Ukraine cargo ship sailing from Ghana, eight of the nine African men were murdered. Kingsley Ofosu survived to tell the story, vividly dramatized in "Deadly Voyage," which will have its premiere tomorrow night at 8. This is the first production of HBO NYC, a new Home Box Office movie division based in New York. The film, undertaken in association with the BBC, was made in Ghana and England.</p>
        <p>Highly sensitive issues are not ignored but, for the most part, only skimmed. Harboring of stowaways is severely punished by most governments. In New York, each one found costs the shipping company $45,000. In this instance, on a ship hobbled by the collapse of the Soviet Union, crews are paid poorly, actually making less than the dock workers get in Ghana. And then there's the nasty element of racial prejudice. One of the murderers rationalizes about the black Africans: "You saw how the police treated them in New York. It's the same everywhere. Nobody wants them."</p>
        <p>The primary focus of "Deadly Voyage," though, is kept on the terrifying experience of the nine stowaways, especially Kingsley (Omar Epps) and his brother Albert (Jean-Claude LaMarre). With dreams of New York City and the Statue of Liberty, they decide, after Kingsley wins a lottery, to take their chances, bringing along money to pay for their passage just in case.</p>
        <p>But after taking the money, the ship's chief officer, Ion (Sean Pertwee), does not want his career jeopardized by security problems, especially when a company representative, Vlachos (David Suchet) is aboard to document any problems. The ship's captain (Joss Ackland) is a drunk and a weakling, given to snide remarks about Russians and Jews. Ion takes over and rounds up some of the crew's more aggressive thugs. The torture of the stowaways begins, gradually escalating into executions and the tossing overboard of the bodies, some still alive. In one chilling moment, one of the killers chasing the African suddenly shouts: "Don't shoot. You'll kill my dog."</p>
        <p>Apart from Kingsley, played superbly by Mr. Epps, and Mr. Pertwee's irredeemably villainous Ion, most of the characters in the film are little more  than stick figures. Distinguished actors like Mr. Ackland and Mr. Suchet are reduced to posturing, one boozily incoherent, the other haughtily officious. This is not a great movie. It is, however, a searing descent into human cruelty. The film, directed by John MacKenzie ("The Long Good Friday"), is nightmarishly  harrowing. The actor Danny Glover (HBO's "Mandela") is, along with George Faber, one of the executive producers.</p>
        <p>'Bad Dads' Fox, Sunday at 7 P.M. (Channel 5 in New York)</p>
        <p>This unusual Father's Day special, with George Foreman as host, goes to a Federal penitentiary to follow some intense confrontations, touching reconciliations and occasional disappointments in a four-week "H.O.P.E. for Life" program on being a parent. The enrolled inmates, all convicted on drug charges and all admitting that they have been bad dads, are confronted by visiting teen-agers who, playing the roles of surrogate children, have been abandoned or abused by their own parents. The executive producer is Arnold Shapiro, whose 1979 award-winning "Scared Straight" documented prison lifers bluntly warning juvenile delinquents about living in prison.</p>
        <p>Three inmates are profiled in depth, experiencing, we're told, "what it would be like if your kids had the courage to confront you." As hard-boiled facades crumble, the men are encouraged to express their feelings in letters to those, dead or alive, they may have hurt or disappointed. There are confessions. ("I was afraid I hurt your feelings so bad you'd never love me again.") An occasional statistic pops up on the screen. ("Dads spend an average of 30 minutes a day interacting with their children.") And there are quite moving moments, one being when a young child, listening to her abusive father's apology, makes clear that, though hurt and still wary, she's only too eager to let him back into her life. The message for fathers everywhere: "The greatest gift you can give your child is your undivided attention."</p>
