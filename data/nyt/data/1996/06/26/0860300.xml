        <p>In both 1988 and 1992, the Olympic trials were a time for the American public to get acquainted with a new wave of gymnasts.</p>
        <p>This year, the trials are an opportunity to get reacquainted.</p>
        <p>Motivated by the psychic and material rewards of performing at home in Atlanta, many of those who leaped and landed with varying degrees of grace in Barcelona, Spain, are back for more.</p>
        <p>Four of the six men who competed in the last Olympics are in Boston, where the trials got under way tonight with the preliminary round of competition in rhythmic gymnastics.</p>
        <p>More surprisingly and significantly, three of the six women who competed for  the United States in 1992 are here: Dominique Dawes, Kerri Strug and Shannon Miller, who won five medals in Barcelona but will be a spectator at these trials because of chronic tendinitis in her wrist.</p>
        <p>Even though their sport is called "women's" gymnastics, Dawes, Strug, Miller  and most of their competitors were still girls in Barcelona. Dawes and Miller were 15; Strug, at 14, was the youngest member of the entire United States Olympic team.</p>
        <p>But the trend has shifted slightly in their sport, which drew considerable criticism for the enormous physical and psychological demands it was placing on  its increasingly youthful competitors, whose careers rarely lasted longer than a single Olympiad.</p>
        <p>After the Atlanta Games, the minimum age required for women's senior international competition will rise from 14 to 15. After sending a team with an  average age of 16 to Barcelona, the Americans, form and health permitting, will  probably send one with an average age of at least 17 to Atlanta. "I think it will be a great image for gymnastics," said Kathy Scanlan, the new president of  USA Gymnastics, who is quick to emphasize her organization's increased emphasis  on nutrition and health.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the two most prominent Americans in the last two years -- Miller and 14-year-old Dominique Moceanu -- will miss the trials with injuries. Miller's wrist has been bothering her since December; Moceanu has a stress fracture in her right tibia. Scanlan said team physicians are optimistic both will be healthy in time for Atlanta.</p>
        <p>In theory, the top seven in the trials were supposed to form the Olympic team. But now Miller's and Moceanu's scores from the national championships earlier this month in Knoxville, Tenn., will be carried over when the women's competition begins on Friday. Miller, who finished first in the nationals with 78.380 points, is in no danger of being bumped from the squad. Moceanu, third with 78.220, is slightly more vulnerable.</p>
        <p>"It's going to be an excruciating experience, standing there and watching those scores," said Moceanu's coach, Bela Karolyi, who estimates that scores from past nationals have increased by 8-tenths of a point at trials.</p>
        <p>That may be true, but it would still take some stunning performances from her peers for Moceanu to be bumped all the way out of the top seven. In Miller's and Moceanu's absence, the favorites in Boston are 16-year-old Jaycie Phelps, Strug  and Dawes, but only if Dawes can improve on her dismal compulsory performance at nationals.</p>
        <p>The men, who begin competition on Thursday, will decide their Olympic team by combining their scores with the ones they earned at the nationals, which counted 40 percent. The trials will count for the remaining 60 percent. Blaine Wilson and the 1992 Olympian John Roethlisberger, first and second, respectively, at the nationals, are already in fine position. So is John MacReady, who finished third, but the other four team members are very difficult to predict. Little more than a point separates Kip Simons, who finished fourth at nationals, and Stephen McCain, who finished 11th.</p>
