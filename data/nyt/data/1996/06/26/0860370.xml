        <p>Shareholders of Mesa Inc. approved a refinancing today that turns over control from T. Boone Pickens, the company's founder, to Richard Rainwater, a Fort Worth financier. But they did not go along peacefully</p>
        <p>In substantial numbers, shareholders voted against the refinancing, which greatly dilutes their own holdings. In addition, shareholders refused to approve a 1-for-4 reverse stock split that management had recommended. Rarely do shareholders at any company vote down management proposals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rainwater will invest as much as $265 million on preferential terms that include control of the company.  His money and his presence are enabling Mesa to reduce its billion-dollar debt load and lower interest rates on the rest. Mr. Rainwater has asked Mr. Pickens to step aside as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Pickens will remain until Mr. Rainwater finds a replacement and will continue as a director and significant shareholder. The loudest opposition to Mr. Rainwater's plans came from hostile investors led  by David Batchelder, Mesa's former president and a Pickens protege. While Mr. Batchelder and his billionaire confederates, Marvin Davis and Dennis Washington, were certainly not seen or heard at today's meeting, their influence was clear.  In the Mesa proxy statement for today's voting, they said that Mesa was harming  its shareholders by letting Mr. Rainwater invest too cheaply. The company has said that no alternative offer was as good.</p>
        <p>Although the Batchelder group never reported holding as much as 10 percent of Mesa's shares, 19 percent of the shares voted today went against the terms of the Rainwater investment. More than 71 percent went against the reverse stock split.</p>
        <p>On a low shareholder turnout of less than 68 percent, the refinancing narrowly won the required majority with just 54 percent of the total shares approving, 13 percent against and the rest abstaining. The reverse stock split failed with 48 percent in favor and 17 percent opposed.</p>
        <p>Management had recommended the split to make the shares more attractive to investors and brokers, many of whom avoid stocks priced as low as Mesa, which has traded between $2.625 and $5.50 the last 52 weeks. Mesa, based in the Dallas suburbs, closed today at $5.375, up 12.5 cents on the Big Board in busy trading. Mr. Batchelder, who now only represents Mr. Washington, noted in a brief phone interview that he was glad Mr. Washington's shares had risen back above his $5 purchase price.</p>
        <p>No shareholders spoke against the reverse split, but it apparently became a vehicle for protesting the broader plan. Only one holder publicly attacked Mr. Rainwater's terms.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the meeting, held at a hotel banquet room here that was crowded with shareholders, investment bankers, lawyers and Mr. Pickens's friends, gave Mr. Rainwater a chance to introduce himself and his investment strategy.</p>
        <p>Having decided that natural gas prices were ready to rebound, Mr. Rainwater said, he saw long ago that Mesa's prime properties and operations made the company a winning investment. "The tide has changed in the oil and gas industry," he said. "This company is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the opportunities."</p>
