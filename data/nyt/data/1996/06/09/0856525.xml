        <p>Bob Dole and Bill Clinton have begun trying to outbid each other over who will expand NATO faster, in a naked effort to court votes from Americans of Eastern European origin. In one of his last acts as a senator, Mr. Dole, accompanied by visiting Polish dignitary Lech Walesa, introduced a bill that would compel the Administration to speed NATO's expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which Mr. Clinton vows to do but at a more cautious pace. Now, it's always nice to see Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton agreeing on a major foreign policy initiative -- but not when they're both wrong. And on this one they're both wrong. NATO expansion is a bad idea.</p>
        <p>The NATO expanders argue that after the cold war a strategic vacuum exists in the heart of Europe, between Germany and Russia, and if NATO doesn't fill it, an inherently expansionist Russia will. The NATO expanders also argue that the best way to consolidate the new democracies in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is to bring them into NATO.</p>

        <p>Bob Dole and Bill Clinton have begun trying to outbid each other over who will expand NATO faster, in a naked effort to court votes from Americans of Eastern European origin. In one of his last acts as a senator, Mr. Dole, accompanied by visiting Polish dignitary Lech Walesa, introduced a bill that would compel the Administration to speed NATO's expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which Mr. Clinton vows to do but at a more cautious pace. Now, it's always nice to see Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton agreeing on a major foreign policy initiative -- but not when they're both wrong. And on this one they're both wrong. NATO expansion is a bad idea.</p>
        <p>The NATO expanders argue that after the cold war a strategic vacuum exists in the heart of Europe, between Germany and Russia, and if NATO doesn't fill it, an inherently expansionist Russia will. The NATO expanders also argue that the best way to consolidate the new democracies in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is to bring them into NATO.</p>
        <p>Next month, Prof. Michael Mandelbaum, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, will publish a highly original and provocative book, "The Dawn of Peace in Europe," that demolishes these arguments. Mr. Mandelbaum argues that no strategic vacuum exists in Europe for NATO to fill. To the contrary, he explains, a new, highly desirable security system has taken root there, but no one has noticed.</p>
        <p>What is that system? First are the political revolutions of 1989-91, which ended the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe. They not only eliminated the major standing cause of war in that region -- the oppressive Soviet occupation -- but gave birth to a new set of independent, democratic states west of Russia. These states, from Ukraine to Bulgaria, would not be easily overrun by a Russian Army that cannot take Chechnya. Second are the arms control agreements concluded between Washington and Moscow in the early 1990's, which required both sides to  restructure their nuclear and conventional forces in Europe in a way that reduced or eliminated offensive weapons, while emphasizing defensive weapons.</p>
        <p>This combination of newly liberated states and newly restructured armed forces, says Mr. Mandelbaum, eliminates the main motive for going to war in Central Europe and sharply reduces the means -- thereby accomplishing precisely  what an expanded NATO is supposed to do: prevent a Russian attack. But what if the Communists win in Russia and start making aggressive noises? Well, that would be unfortunate, but Russia is not the Soviet Union. Indeed, the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Mandelbaum argues, is central to this new security structure because the Soviet Union was a unique machine for producing military power. "It is not that the Soviet Union had a military industrial complex," argues Mr. Mandelbaum, "it was a military industrial complex." Only a centrally  planned Soviet system could devote 30 percent of G.N.P. to military spending, and without that system, Russia cannot field the Soviet-style military might that once dominated Europe. As for those who say NATO expansion is needed to promote democracy in Central Europe, Mr. Mandelbaum counters that democracy there is not threatened and, if it were, the European Union, an economic/political institution, would be the more appropriate vehicle for saving it. Besides, if NATO is a tool for democracy promotion it should be expanded first to Russia and Ukraine, where democracy is shakier and the stakes higher.</p>
        <p>The truth is we already have the only security order we need in Europe. The best way to destabilize it would be to expand NATO. Such a move would undercut the democratic reformers in Moscow, strengthen the hard-line nationalists, possibly prompt Russia to back away from the arms control agreements and certainly encourage Russia to view Central Europe as a new threat. For what? For a few ethnic votes in Ohio? A continuing U.S. presence in Europe is important, and NATO is the best vehicle for that presence. So the world needs NATO, but not more NATO. What it needs more of is T-I-M-E -- time for the arms control treaties to become even more embedded, time for the states of Central and Eastern Europe to become stronger and time for Russia to adjust itself to both and to find its way toward democracy.</p>
