        <p>Rosie O'Donnell didn't believe she was doing anything revolutionary by modeling her new syndicated daytime talk show after the old "Merv Griffin Show"  instead of the new "Ricki Lake Show."</p>
        <p>But viewers and critics seem to agree that Ms. O'Donnell, with a format that  emphasizes jokes and light banter with celebrity guests, has brought a breath of fresh air to what had become a torrid blast of hot air on daytime talk shows.</p>
        <p>In ratings the first week, Ms. O'Donnell's show beat Ricki, Geraldo, Jerry Springer and all the other talkmeisters except the Queen, Oprah, who herself has abandoned the trash-wallow format. The biggest compliment to Ms. O'Donnell: syndicators are already scrambling to find the next Rosie-like host.</p>
