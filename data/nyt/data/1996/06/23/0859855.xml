        <p>HOME-STYLE fruit desserts, notably cobblers and crisps, are riding a wave of  popularity. And no wonder. They are easier than pie. Fresh fruit judiciously sweetened is given just a topping of biscuit, streusel or batter.</p>
        <p>Now is the prefect time for them, with summer's bounty of apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, cherries and berries filling the market. A dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream on the finished product is always a welcome embellishment.</p>

        <p>HOME-STYLE fruit desserts, notably cobblers and crisps, are riding a wave of  popularity. And no wonder. They are easier than pie. Fresh fruit judiciously sweetened is given just a topping of biscuit, streusel or batter.</p>
        <p>Now is the prefect time for them, with summer's bounty of apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, cherries and berries filling the market. A dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream on the finished product is always a welcome embellishment.</p>
        <p>Nectarine Crisp  Total time: 1 hour, plus cooling</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons softened unsalted butter 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 cup light brown sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch 3 pounds ripe nectarines, pitted and cut in eighths 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/2 cup flour Whipped cream or ice cream.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a shallow five- to six-cup baking dish with a little butter.</p>
        <p>2. Lightly mix half a teaspoon of the cinnamon, half a cup of the brown sugar and the cornstarch together. Toss the nectarines with the lemon juice, fold in the sugar mixture and spread in the baking dish.</p>
        <p>3. With a fork or a pastry blender, or by pulsing in a food processor, combine the flour, remaining sugar and cinnamon with the remaining butter until  crumbly. Spread over the nectarines.</p>
        <p>4. Bake about 40 minutes, until the top has browned and the filling is bubbly. Allow the crisp to cool to lukewarm, then serve with whipped cream or ice cream.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Cherry-Berry Cobbler  Total time: 1 hour plus cooling</p>
        <p>4 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups pitted, halved fresh cherries (about 1 pound) 1 cup blueberries 1 1/2 cups raspberries 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon quick-cooking tapioca 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder Pinch of salt 1 extra-large egg 1/3 cup buttermilk Whipped cream.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter four individual 8- to 10-ounce ramekins with half a tablespoon of butter. Line the bottom of the oven with foil to catch drips.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the cherries, blueberries and raspberries in a saucepan. Stir in the half cup of sugar, bring to a simmer and cook a few minutes, just until the  fruit softens and becomes juicy. Remove from heat and fold in the lemon juice and tapioca.</p>
        <p>3. Put fruit in baking dishes, filling them no more than two-thirds.</p>
        <p>4. Mix the flour, baking powder, two tablespoons of the granulated sugar and  salt together. Cut in the remaining butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat the egg and buttermilk together; then stir into the flour mixture to  form a thick batter. Drop a large blob of the batter on top of each dish of fruit. The fruit does not have to be covered completely. Sprinkle with the remaining granulated sugar.</p>
        <p>5. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the topping is brown and the fruit bubbly. Allow to cool to lukewarm; then serve, with a dollop of whipped cream on top.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
