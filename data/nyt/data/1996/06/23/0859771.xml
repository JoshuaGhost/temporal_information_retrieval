        <p>WERE it not for a Federal highway law that authorized funds for the enhancement of local roads, many projects now in progress -- from the creation of bike and pedestrian trails to the restoration of historic buildings -- might  never have been undertaken.</p>
        <p>That is the consensus of Long Island and state officials on the so-called "transportation enhancement" program known as Istea (pronounced ice tea). Twenty-seven projects have just been awarded their third -- and possibly final -- round of financing.</p>
        <p>We all too often forget that bicycles and walking are among the best modes  of transportation," said John B. Daly, the Commissioner of the state's Department of Transportation. "This enhancement program has focused attention on worthwhile projects that could otherwise be overlooked in the press for improving roads and bridges and getting more asphalt down."</p>
        <p>Istea is the acronym for the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, a $151 billion transportation law signed into law in 1991. Under one of its provisions, states must set aside for enhancement work 10 percent of Federal funds ticketed for roads other than major highways.</p>
        <p>In New York State, $92.3 million was set aside for the program, with $17.36 million apportioned to Long Island. The state used up its allotment for this year and 1997 for this year's awards, so this round could be the final one, unless Congress extends Istea when it expires on Sept. 30, 1997.</p>
        <p>Local municipalities or state agencies must sponsor enhancement projects and  must agree to pay for at least 20 percent of their cost. In-house services, bond issues, fund-raising and other methods are used to generate local contributions.</p>
        <p>Liberal guidelines allow a wide leeway on how the money can be spent. Eligible proposals have included the restoration of historic buildings, revitalization of ponds and streams and the acquisition of scenic easements.</p>
        <p>"What Istea has really helped facilitate is a sense of place for Long Island," said Robert B. MacKay, one of 21 members of the Long Island Transportation Enhancement Advisory Committee panel formed to select local projects. Mr. MacKay is also director of the Society for Long Island Antiquities, a preservation group.</p>
        <p>"It's that sense of place that is going to be vital to our economic future if we are going to continue to be both a tourist destination and an attractive place to live, work and play," he said.</p>
        <p>The 27 projects on Long Island that are among this year's award winners will  receive a total of $8.53 million in Federal financing, to be augmented by about  $1.8 million from local sources. Most of the projects selected over the last two years are already under way, said David Glass who coordinates the Long Island program for the state's Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>T HE 1996 awards, which Gov. George E. Pataki announced May 25, include funds for the restoration of a historic church in Cold Spring Harbor, for revitalizing the Freeport waterfront and for a walkway along Greenport's harbor that the village's mayor, David E. Kapell, said would be "the fulfillment of a dream that began 30 years ago."</p>
        <p>The largest award, $1.293 million to Freeport, will permit the acquisition of a 3.75-acre waterfront parcel and the construction of a boardwalk. The village will contribute an additional $431,000 to the project's $1.724 million cost.</p>
        <p>The parcel, at the foot of Miller and South Ocean Avenues, had once been approved for construction of a 40-unit condominium that was never built. Instead, it will become a park, with benches, walkways and a gazebo. The proposed boardwalk, which will stretch from Woodcleft Avenue west to the Miller  Canal, will cross the property.</p>
        <p>The village received two previous Istea awards for its so-called Nautical Mile, which extends down Woodcleft Avenue, a thoroughfare lined by boatyards and other marine-related uses, as well as by restaurants and shops. The Federal  money, together with local funds, is being used for walkways and bicycle paths.</p>
        <p>There has been an ongoing effort to turn the Nautical Mile into a major tourist destination, and the Istea funds will be vital in achieving that goal, said Eric Hemphill, executive director of the village's Community Development Agency.</p>
        <p>In Greenport, a waterfront revitalization plan has been given a $503,000 Istea award this year. The village will contribute $126,000 to the $629,000 project to construct a 1,650-foot long bicycle and pedestrian path along the shoreline of Greenport Harbor. An international design competition will be used  to select an architect.</p>
        <p>"We view our harbor walk and the whole revitalization project as bringing the Greenport economy out of the doldrums," Mayor Kapell said.</p>
        <p>Another waterfront project, this one in Stony Brook, will use a $144,000 grant to improve pedestrian access between the Museums at Stony Brook and Stony  Brook Harbor.</p>
        <p>The City of Glen Cove is planning to link its downtown area to its waterfront at Garvies Point with walkways and bicycle paths. The rejuvenation of a mill pond next to the firehouse is part of the $731,000 project made possible by a $570,000 Istea grant and $161,000 from the city.</p>
        <p>"Some people don't even realize we are a waterfront community, and this will  remind them that we are," said Patricia A. Bourne, executive director of the city's Community Development Agency.</p>
        <p>And in Islip, which received two Federal grants totaling $415,00, streetscape improvements in downtown Bay Shore costing $287,000 will include opening up water vistas. The town will contribute $57,000 to the Bayshore project and $47,000 to the townwide sidewalk and bicycle-path improvements.</p>
        <p>Historic preservation will also benefit from this year's awards.</p>
        <p>I N Cold Spring Harbor, the former Methodist Church on Main Street will be restored with the help of a $115,000 Istea grant.</p>
        <p>The Gothic-style building dating to 1842 will become the new headquarters of  the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, which will pay the balance of the more than $600,000 cost of acquisition and restoration.</p>
        <p>The Town of Riverhead received two awards totaling $313,000 for historic preservation, which it will augment with a contribution of $78,000. One will be  used for improvements on and around the 62-year-old Suffolk Theater on Main Street, now undergoing renovations as an arts center.</p>
        <p>The other will further enhance the Hallockville Museum Farm on Sound Avenue.  The plan is to move additional 18th-century buildings to the complex, and to create "something akin to a Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts," said Andrea H. Lohneiss, Riverhead's Community Development Agency director.</p>
        <p>Other awards include one for an $867,000 project sponsored by the Nassau County Department of Parks and Recreation under which a $507,000 Istea grant would be used to help acquire the 92-year-old Jackson-Malcolm farmstead on Route 106 in Jericho.</p>
        <p>The property, which includes a barn that the county already owns, adjoins the county's Jericho Preserve. It could be commercially developed, said John B. Kiernan, Nassau's parks commissioner. "Without Istea, I wouldn't know of any other funding source that would allow us to buy it," he said.</p>
        <p>A historic building in Brookhaven, the Davis house in Coram, will be restored with a $330,000 grant. The pre-Revolutionary War structure was used as a meeting place for town trustees for almost 100 years.</p>
        <p>But for many people, perhaps the most meaningful legacy of Istea will be the  network of bicycle and pedestrian paths that is being created all over Long Island.</p>
        <p>Brookhaven was the sponsor this year of a project that, using a $736,000 Federal grant, will construct 36 miles of new bikeways connecting parklands from the Atlantic Ocean to Long Island Sound. In the Town of Southold, $393,000 will  be used to implement safety measures for cyclists and to create new trails through public and private lands.  The Suffolk County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, in conjunction with Nassau County's parks agency, will mark a historic trail along 25A from the Queens County line to Port Jefferson.</p>
        <p>"I would like to see pedestrian and bike space included in every project done by the Department of Transportation," said Nancy Manfredonia, president of the Greenbelt Trail Conference, a group that creates and maintains hiking and biking trails. "There is now more understanding of that need because Istea has helped promote the idea that cyclists and pedestrians matter."</p>
