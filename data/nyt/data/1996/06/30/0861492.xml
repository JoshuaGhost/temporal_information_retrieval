        <p>THE Hartford Symphony has a new summer home, and Connecticut has a new concert series, as the Talcott Mountain Music Festival begins a series of three  outdoor concerts on ITT Hartford's Simsbury campus.</p>
        <p>"It's an answer to a long-awaited dream," says the orchestra's president, Dwight A. Johnson. "The creation of a summer series has been one of this organization's objectives for more than a decade, and is now a crucial element of our long-range plan."</p>

        <p>THE Hartford Symphony has a new summer home, and Connecticut has a new concert series, as the Talcott Mountain Music Festival begins a series of three  outdoor concerts on ITT Hartford's Simsbury campus.</p>
        <p>"It's an answer to a long-awaited dream," says the orchestra's president, Dwight A. Johnson. "The creation of a summer series has been one of this organization's objectives for more than a decade, and is now a crucial element of our long-range plan."</p>
        <p>Simsbury is equally pleased at the new collaboration. "We are thrilled to have the Hartford Symphony interested in performing in our town," says First Selectman Mary A. Glassman, "and especially grateful to ITT Hartford for making  their beautiful site available." A performing arts amphitheater is being planned, and it is hoped that the festival will grow to attract international artists.</p>
        <p>The current series opens July 4 with a "Stars, Stripes and Strings" program under the music director Michael Lankester that includes Gershwin's "American in Paris" and Morton Gould's "American Salute." On July 11, the program is called "Symphony Under the Stars" and on July 18 Judy Collins is the guest singer. All  three concerts begin at 7:30 P.M. July 21 is the backup date in case of severe weather. Picnickers are welcome, starting at 6 each evening; the number to call  for further information is 244-2999.</p>
        <p>Thirty-seven members of Cappella Cantorum are taking Randall Thompson's "Frostiana" as well as songs by Stephen Foster and Aaron Copland and folk favorites like "Shenandoah" on a tour of Britain and Ireland next month; at 3 this afternoon, Barry Asch conducts the choir in a preview at Westbrook Congregational Church.</p>
        <p>A happy burst of American song may also be provided by the National Chorale's 16th annual Connecticut Music Theater Festival called "The Best of Broadway." The show goes on at Cove Island Park in Stamford at 6 next Sunday evening; more  Broadway material arrives at the Norwalk Concert Hall at 7:30 P.M. on July 12, with a 6 o'clock encore on July 14 at Cove Island. All three concerts are free and no tickets are needed, but for other information, call 977-4692 (Stamford) or 854-7806 (Norwalk).</p>
        <p>The Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, which has sent many productions on  to Broadway, has raided Hollywood for its current show, a staged edition of the  1973 movie "Paper Moon." The score is by Larry Grossman and Ellen Fitzhugh, whose earlier collaborations include the musical "Grind" and the animated Disney feature "The Great Mouse Detective." The 17-member "Paper Moon" cast is headed by Mark Zimmermann with a pair of 10-year-olds, Lindsay Cummings and Joanna Pacitti, alternating as the precocious daughter.</p>
        <p>Curtain times are 8 P.M. Wednesday through Friday, 9 on Saturday evenings and 6:30 on Sundays, with matinees Wednesdays at 2:30, Saturdays at 4 and Sundays at 2, through Sept. 13 (873-8668).</p>
        <p>Nary a piece of American music is to be found at Music Mountain and Norfolk,  or at two more modest series that begin on Tuesday: Wesleyan University's "Summer at the Center" and the Courtyard Concerts at St. Mark's Parish.</p>
        <p>At Music Mountain, the Blair String Quartet offers at Saturday's 8 P.M. recital one movement each from quartets by Beethoven, Borodin, Ravel, Haydn, Dvorak, Mendelssohn, Puccini and Tchaikovsky. After intermission, the guest artist, James Campbell, will join the ensemble for the complete Brahms Clarinet  Quintet. More Brahms follows when the St. Petersburg Quartet and the guest artist Justin Blasdale perform the G Minor Piano Quartet. The rest of next Sunday afternoon's 3 o'clock concert is made up of string quartets by Borodin and Shostakovich. For credit card reservations, call 824-7126.</p>
        <p>Mozart's Quintet for Piano and Winds is one of the attractions of Friday's 8  P.M. Norfolk concert by Peter Frankl and the New York Woodwind Quintet; another  is Dvorak's "American" Quartet, originally for strings, but presented in Georges Barrere's transcription for five winds.</p>
        <p>On Saturday evening, also at 8, the Vermeer Quartet returns to Norfolk after  a hiatus of more than 10 years. On the program are Mendelssohn's Opus 12 prefacing quartets by Leos Janacek and Alberto Ginastera. The Vermeer Quartet will return to Norfolk on July 12 and join the violist Nobuko Imai and the cellist Antonio Meneses for string sextets by Dvorak, Strauss and Schoenberg (542-3000).</p>
        <p>At St. Mark's Church in New Canaan, the 24th season of Courtyard Concerts begins Tuesday with the visiting soloist Rodney Ayers, an organist. The performers on July 9 are the flutist Joel Hupper and the pianist Margaret Mills; on July 16 the Nutmeg Trio and the soprano Annette Nouraine share the stage, and another duo, the baritone David Timpane and the pianist Katya Grineva, close the cycle on July 23. All the 6:15 P.M. recitals are free, and listeners are encouraged to arrive early and picnic on the lawns to the accompaniment of preconcert music on the church's 30-bell French carillon (966-4515).</p>
        <p>The first evening concert of Wesleyan's Summer at the Center isn't scheduled  until July 10 (traditional Irish music and dance with Cherish the Ladies), but two events just after noon are at hand this week in World Music Hall: Brazilian  jazz on Tuesday with the Samba Brasil Quartet, and on Wednesday, the dancer Peentz Dubble in a lecture-demonstration entitled "The Practice and Philosophy of Hatha Yoga." Tickets are sold only at the door, but for updated performance information, call 685- 2695.</p>
