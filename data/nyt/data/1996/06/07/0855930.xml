        <p>Sandro Chia Sidney Janis Gallery 110 West 57th Street Through June 22</p>
        <p>Maybe it's time to cut Sandro Chia a little slack. At their best, these latest paintings -- as usual, big, festive reveries involving clunky, vaguely antique figures in arcadian landscapes -- have charm. The figures allude to Cezanne and Picasso, but they also look comic: shy, sheepish and somehow distracted, a little like characters from Jean-Jacques Sempe cartoons. Even St.  Sebastian, whom Mr. Chia depicts shot through with arrows, seems to gaze absently toward the sky, as if pausing on an afternoon stroll.</p>
        <p>Do the works mean to be wry or serious? It's impossible to tell, but either  way, the impression they make is oddly cheerful: Mr. Chia uses eye-popping reds, yellows and oranges, mixed with electric blue and turquoise, the paint thick and generously doled out; and the results are as vibrant, even joyful, as the figures, with their vacant, passive expressions, are not.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, Mr. Chia's work is too ham-fistedly drawn, his surfaces too clotted and pasty, to look anything but ludicrous. But mostly, it's at least colorful and decorative, which is something, after all. For years, he has been made to bear more than his share of the blame for what was wrong about art in the 1980's. If the expectations and rhetoric surrounding him were once inflated, that's no reason to disregard whatever's O.K. about what he's doing now, is it?</p>
