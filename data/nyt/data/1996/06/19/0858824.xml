        <p>The final round of the Russian presidential election could take place on July 7. Or maybe on July 3. Possibly June 30, though there is also a chance voting could be held on July 14.</p>
        <p>The most heated political battle going on right now between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Communist rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, is not about whether to roll back economic reform or withdraw troops from Chechnya, but when exactly their fateful runoff should take place.</p>
        <p>And it all comes down to a Sunday in the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin, who wants to maintain the momentum he built today with the endorsement of the popular third-place finisher, the retired general Aleksandr I. Lebed, is bulldozing his way through a host of technical and political obstacles to hold the runoff as soon as possible, which would be on June 30.</p>
        <p>But that is a Sunday, a day when many urban Russians in big cities flee to the countryside to relax or to work in their vegetable gardens. Mr. Yeltsin's chances largely depend on a high turnout in big cities.</p>
        <p>Sunday is traditionally the day Russians vote, but the law only stipulates that elections take place on a holiday. On Monday the President asked Parliament to declare July 3, a Wednesday, as a day off.</p>
        <p>Communists would prefer a Sunday, because their highly motivated voters are likely to turn out no matter how splendid the weather. Mr. Yeltsin's supporters, like their President, are not as disciplined.</p>
        <p>The Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, Nikolai Ryabov, quickly approved the President's notion. Mr. Ryabov, who was unaware that the law requires that elections take place on a holiday, argued that hardworking Russian citizens deserved the break.</p>
        <p>"It is very desirable that the second round be held on a day off," Mr. Ryabov said today. And he didn't mean on a Sunday. "We have already taken one day away  from the people," Mr. Ryabov explained, referring to last Sunday's election. "And if we go on like that we will in essence infringe on the citizens' right to rest."</p>
        <p>The Communists have not protested the President's gambit. Instead, they countered with one of their own. Explaining that they welcome the idea of moving up the election, Communist members of Parliament today silkily offered Friday, July 5, which would give Russian voters a three-day weekend, and even less incentive to break up their country dacha plans.</p>
        <p>"Everybody has an interest in going on with the process and minimizing the waiting and torpor," Mr. Zyuganov said in an interview with Izvestia.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Yeltsin's campaign aides had been congratulating themselves on their cleverness in having Mr. Yeltsin ask Parliament to approve July 3 as a holiday, certain that if the Communists blocked his proposal, it would backfire  on them.</p>
        <p>"The President wants to give people an extra day off, and the Communists won't let him?" a campaign adviser explained smugly. "That should lose them the  election right there."</p>
        <p>After the Communists, who dominate the Parliament, proposed July 5, campaign  aides regrouped to consider their next move.</p>
        <p>The Central Electoral Commission sets the date for the second round of voting, and the only stipulation is that it must take place within two weeks of  the day the official results of the first-round are published. A commission spokesman said that would probably take place later this week.</p>
        <p>In his haste, Mr. Yeltsin has not hesitated to use the privileges of incumbency to roll over election rules. Candidates are forbidden to campaign until the official figures are counted; Mr. Yeltsin went on national television  the day after he narrowly won the first round and implored his supporters not to forget to vote for him in the second.</p>
        <p>Electoral Commission rules stipulate that ballots for the second round cannot be printed until the final tally comes out. But since the process of printing and distributing ballots to the 93,000 polling stations across Russia is dauntingly lengthy, the commission, quick to accommodate the President, appears  to have set the presses rolling early.</p>
        <p>The Electoral Commission can also play hardball. The commission complained today that Mr. Yeltsin's Government owes the commission $90 million and is refusing to pay up.</p>
        <p>"If the Finance Ministry does not transfer the money within two days," Aleksandr Veshnyakov, a top electoral official warned today, "the preparations for the second round will not be completed."</p>
