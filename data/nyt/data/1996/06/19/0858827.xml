        <p>A 13-year-old boy must undergo counseling for a year for plotting to blow up  his school with a homemade bomb he learned to make from the Internet.</p>
        <p>Although he called the youth "a threat to the community," Judge Robert J. Rossi of Onondaga County Family Court decided to place the boy under the supervision of the State Social Services Department rather than the State Division For Youth.</p>
        <p>The youth will be placed in a residential treatment program as soon as a suitable one can be found, Judge Rossi said. The judge said he would review the  teen-ager's case in a year to determine whether he will need further counseling.</p>
        <p>"Mom and Dad," Judge Rossi said to the boy's parents,. "this is beyond you. He needs professional help."</p>
        <p>Prosecutors identified the youth as the ringleader in a foiled plot to destroy his academic records by blowing up the office at Pine Grove Junior High  School in Minoa, a Syracuse suburb.</p>
        <p>Two other boys, ages 13 and 14, were sentenced last week to a year's probation and 400 hours of community service for their roles in the plot. They pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal facilitation in May and admitted obtaining some of the supplies used to make the bomb.</p>
        <p>The youth identified as the alleged ringleader pleaded guilty to felony criminal solicitation at the same time. He told the authorities he found instructions on the Internet on how to make a homemade explosive.</p>
