        <p>THE nation now turns its weary sports eye from the conclusion of the basketball season to what is essentially, if not officially, the start of the baseball season. It turns, in fact, from the glitter of Dennis Rodman to the glower of Albert Belle.</p>
        <p>Rodman, the rebounding fiend of the Chicago Bulls, and Belle, the slugger extraordinaire and sluggish left fielder of the Cleveland Indians, are the two most controversial players in their sports. And in many ways, they typify the differences in the sports, the latter of which anachronistically still bills itself as the national pastime, and the former of which has seemingly become not just the most popular game in America, but a rival to soccer as the international pastime, as well.</p>

        <p>THE nation now turns its weary sports eye from the conclusion of the basketball season to what is essentially, if not officially, the start of the baseball season. It turns, in fact, from the glitter of Dennis Rodman to the glower of Albert Belle.</p>
        <p>Rodman, the rebounding fiend of the Chicago Bulls, and Belle, the slugger extraordinaire and sluggish left fielder of the Cleveland Indians, are the two most controversial players in their sports. And in many ways, they typify the differences in the sports, the latter of which anachronistically still bills itself as the national pastime, and the former of which has seemingly become not just the most popular game in America, but a rival to soccer as the international pastime, as well.</p>
        <p>When citizens in China start rooting for the Red Oxen, as they call the Chicago Bulls, and when an elderly Jewish woman in Chicago argues with her octogenarian friend and fellow fan that "you don't know borscht about basketball," you know something is up.</p>
        <p>Basketball seems to have done everything in its power to make the sport more  entertaining, more intriguing to fans. Baseball for a long time has felt that it didn't have to do anything, that it would still be, well, the belle of the ball.</p>
        <p>Not at all. And no one calls attention to his sport quite the way Rodman has. He has been transformed from a prince in the Land of the Weird to a beloved and  effective championship player. Belle, however, just might be the King of the Foreboding Nether World.</p>
        <p>Rodman throws his sweaty jersey to some fan at the end of a game to take home. Belle rifles baseballs at fans and the occasional photographer in order to send them to the hospital.</p>
        <p>When Rodman is scheduled to appear at a book signing, he shows up in drag, complete with eye shadow and a fuchsia feather boa. When Belle is scheduled to appear at an announcement of a candy bar named in his honor, at 11 A.M., he doesn't show up. "I don't go to things that early in the morning," he explained  with a grunt.</p>
        <p>Where Belle may not run out ground balls, Rodman runs down the court with all the high-kicking verve of a show horse.</p>
        <p>Both Rodman and Belle have specialties and particular inadequacies: Rodman the rebounder, but poor shooter; Belle the hitter, but leaden fielder.</p>
        <p>The difference in what the two men do and don't do is that rebounding is the  dirty work of the team, done by the ultimate team man, while hitting is strictly an individual exercise. And if, for example, you expect a good throw to the cut-off man from Belle, you're barking up the wrong tree.</p>
        <p>People who appreciate the games appreciate the nuances, and the personalities. We admire and enjoy the gifted and the conventional -- the Jordans and the Olajuwons in basketball, and the Ripkens and Griffeys in baseball -- but it is the outrageous who capture another part of us, for better  or for worse.</p>
        <p>Both Rodman and Belle have been urged at one time or another by their teams or leagues to undergo psychological counseling. Both have been suspended for actions unbecoming a professional: Rodman this season head-butted a referee; Belle has been suspended in five of the last six seasons, for everything from attacking fans with baseballs to corking his bat to smashing a forearm into a second baseman's nose on the basepaths, a transgression last month that will cost him three games, instead of five, after he won a reduced sentence yesterday.</p>
        <p>Rodman was contrite about his head butt, and said there was no excuse for it. He said his six-game suspension hurt the team. Belle remains sullen, even as he  positions himself to try to break baseball's most storied record: most home runs in a season.</p>
        <p>To many fans, baseball is now the sullen sport. When the powers of baseball drew a curtain over the pennant race and the World Series in 1994, it marked a break from which the game has not recuperated. Attendance is down some 20 to 25  percent from the playing days of 1994.</p>
        <p>Baseball once had Ty Cobb, a great player but a demonic spirit. Baseball, however, could more than tolerate such a character since it was virtually the only game in town, in all our towns. Baseball, by the way, also had a player around that time named Babe Ruth who seemed to interest fans.</p>
        <p>Baseball can no longer be so arrogant about its place in the sports firmament. And a nice helpful touch might be Albert Belle tipping his cap after  a home run, and displaying a head of hair dyed chartreuse.</p>
