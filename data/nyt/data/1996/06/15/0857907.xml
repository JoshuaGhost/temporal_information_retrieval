        <p>There was so much going on around Dwight Gooden last night at Yankee Stadium  that it would be easy to lose sight of his unflinching performance against the most ferocious lineup in all of baseball.</p>
        <p>It was a night in which Albert Belle and his Cleveland teammates were pulled  off the field by their manager to take cover from an unruly crowd; in which Ruben Rivera was demoted to Class AAA Columbus because his cousin Mariano came down with back spasms; in which John Wetteland had to pitch his way out of a jam of his own making in the ninth inning, hours after distancing himself from comments he had made earlier in the week.</p>

        <p>There was so much going on around Dwight Gooden last night at Yankee Stadium  that it would be easy to lose sight of his unflinching performance against the most ferocious lineup in all of baseball.</p>
        <p>It was a night in which Albert Belle and his Cleveland teammates were pulled  off the field by their manager to take cover from an unruly crowd; in which Ruben Rivera was demoted to Class AAA Columbus because his cousin Mariano came down with back spasms; in which John Wetteland had to pitch his way out of a jam of his own making in the ninth inning, hours after distancing himself from comments he had made earlier in the week.</p>
        <p>Just another Friday night in the madhouse known as the Stadium.</p>
        <p>But in the end it was Gooden (6-4) who threw eight sterling innings, giving up seven hits and two runs, to lead the Yankees to a 4-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians.</p>
        <p>When it was over, Yankee Manager Joe Torre summed up the performance his starter put in before 32,580 raucous, sometimes downright frightening, fans in one word: "Wow!"</p>
        <p>For a few moments it looked as if there was a chance -- albeit a slim one --  that the Yankees would be forced to forfeit a game in which they had a 4-2 lead  going into the seventh inning. That was when the Cleveland manager, Mike Hargrove, pulled the Indians off the field after Belle had been the target of a  couple of baseballs and a miniature souvenir bat in little over an inning.</p>
        <p>"It went through my mind," Gooden said when asked if he felt all his work was about to be for naught.</p>
        <p>It would have been a shame. Gooden won for the sixth time in his last seven games and stopped the Yankees' modest losing streak at two games. Since opening  the season by dropping his first three games, Gooden has allowed just 18 earned  runs in his last 63 2/3 innings for an earned run average of 2.54. His e.r.a. for the season is down to 4.09.</p>
        <p>"I am surprised at the way things have been going so fast," said Gooden, who  has emerged as the ace of this injury-riddled Yankee staff.</p>
        <p>Gooden was a little shaky at the outset last night. It was almost as if he wanted to lull the Indians into a false sense of security by allowing them to reach base, only to pick them off, have his catcher Joe Girardi throw them out trying to steal, retire them on force plays or simply strand them on base.</p>
        <p>Through the first three innings, the Indians had seven base runners and just  one run, on a ground-rule double by Jim Thome and a run-scoring single by Tony Pena in the second inning.</p>
        <p>The Yanks, however, answered with two runs in the bottom of the third to take a 2-1 lead. The bottom of the order, which produced all night, led the way. Girardi singled off Chad Ogea (3-1) to open the inning and then scored on Andy Fox's one-out double down the right-field line.</p>
        <p>Fox would then score on Wade Boggs's "sacrifice" fly to right -- after Manny  Ramirez slipped while nonchalantly pivoting to throw the ball back into the infield. Ramirez tossed the ball to Kenny Lofton, who was backing him up on the  play, and Lofton's throw from deep center was too late as Fox sped home.</p>
        <p>Thome answered right back leading off the Cleveland fourth, hammering a fat 1-1 fastball from Gooden into the walkway of the right-field reserved seats to make it a 2-2 ball game. But after Thome's homer, Gooden settled in.</p>
        <p>The right-hander retired 15 of the last 16 batters he faced, including the last 11 in a row. Ogea, on the other hand, began to falter. Hargrove removed his starter with two outs in the sixth, two batters before Derek Jeter delivered a bases-loaded, two-run single off the former Yankee Eric Plunk.</p>
        <p>It would not be much longer before Hargrove removed his team from the field.  Belle had a ball and a miniature bat tossed his way in the sixth, one pitch before Plunk walked Girardi to load the bases for Jeter. Belle glared at the fans along the left-field line in response.</p>
        <p>With one out in the seventh, after another ball was sent past Belle and into  center field, Hargrove made his way out to confer with the umpires and then called his team off the field. He did not protest the game. Most of the crowd began a sing-song chant of "Al-bert! Al-bert!"</p>
        <p>After a delay of three minutes, Belle was escorted from the dugout and back to left field by the crew chief, Umpire Drew Coble. The brooding All-Star was booed heartily during his next at-bat, when a tiring Gooden retired him on a routine fly to center to end the eighth.</p>
        <p>Wetteland, just barely, did the rest.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Yankee General Manager BOB WATSON on RUBEN RIVERA's post-game demotion: "From the first day he came here, I told you he was going to go back. He's going to play every day." MARIANO DUNCAN acted as interpreter for a dejected Rivera, who  hit .277 in 17 games with 1 home run and 10 runs batted in: "He feels let down right now. But he knows he can play in the major leagues for a very long time. He knows he needs to play. If he's sitting on the bench, it's no good for him."  . . . MARIANO RIVERA (back spasms), the Yankees' best reliever this season, was  not available last night. Manager JOE TORRE said he is day to day. The reason Ruben Rivera, and not reliever JIM MECIR, was demoted to make room for today's starter, BRIAN BOEHRINGER, is that Torre feels he needs more pitching. Torre added that Ruben Rivera would be sent down anyway once TIM RAINES was ready to come back from a hamstring injury. . . . Watson called the JOHN WETTELAND situation "a dead issue." Wetteland, who was quoted in a Canadian newspaper on Thursday as saying he was unhappy playing in New York and did not want to return to the Yankees next season, said Friday that it had all been a misunderstanding  and that he wanted to play for the Yankees. Watson said: "Those are his feelings. Everyone is entitled to their own feelings. I'm satisfied with what he says. I don't know what goes through somebody's mind."</p>
