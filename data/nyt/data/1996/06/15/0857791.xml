        <p>The Burmese military junta has outdone itself in advertising its own crude ineptitude. Frustrated by the popularity and prestige of their democratic opponent, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the generals have now erected huge red billboards denouncing the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate as a foreign stooge. But every Burmese knows that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi endured years of house arrest rather than leave the country her father helped free from foreign rule. The real threat to the Burmese people is the junta, formally known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc.</p>
        <p>The billboard blitz follows the recent detention of some 250 members of Mrs.  Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, the undoubted winner of 1990 elections the Slorc then nullified. When, despite the crackdown, she attracted larger and larger crowds for speeches from her house, the junta responded with a decree banning virtually all political activities. So unwarranted were these measures that even diffident Thailand and Japan have condemned Burmese human rights abuses. Japan is the largest outside aid donor to the country the Slorc has renamed Myanmar.</p>

        <p>The Burmese military junta has outdone itself in advertising its own crude ineptitude. Frustrated by the popularity and prestige of their democratic opponent, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the generals have now erected huge red billboards denouncing the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate as a foreign stooge. But every Burmese knows that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi endured years of house arrest rather than leave the country her father helped free from foreign rule. The real threat to the Burmese people is the junta, formally known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc.</p>
        <p>The billboard blitz follows the recent detention of some 250 members of Mrs.  Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, the undoubted winner of 1990 elections the Slorc then nullified. When, despite the crackdown, she attracted larger and larger crowds for speeches from her house, the junta responded with a decree banning virtually all political activities. So unwarranted were these measures that even diffident Thailand and Japan have condemned Burmese human rights abuses. Japan is the largest outside aid donor to the country the Slorc has renamed Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Washington has commendably taken the lead in generating support for more effective collective measures to help the beleaguered Burmese democrats. The Clinton Administration has sent two senior diplomats, William Brown and Stanley  Roth, to sound out Myanmar's neighbors on taking stronger political and economic measures against the Slorc. The mission itself may help deter still harsher repression. Its findings may also determine the feasibility of a ban on new American investment, as proposed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, which the Administration is still weighing.</p>
        <p>When the Slorc lifted Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest last year, there was hope that the generals might loosen their stranglehold on Myanmar. Unhappily, that has not proved to be the case. Until the Burmese junta frees its political prisoners and enters into genuine negotiations with Mrs. Aung San  Suu Kyi and her supporters, it merits the strongest international condemnation.</p>
