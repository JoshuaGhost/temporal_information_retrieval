        <p>To the Editor: On international flights passengers must check in at least one hour in advance, and their last meal can hardly sustain them for 6 to 10 hours of jet travel.</p>
        <p>I departed Mexico at 7 A.M., having arrived at 6 A.M. at the airport. The flight had only peanuts. I arrived in Miami at 1 P.M. My flight to Jacksonville  left in 25 minutes. It was repeatedly delayed. The boarding area snack bar quickly sold out. I was lucky to buy a sandwich, an orange and apple. The airline substituted another plane four hours later. In Jacksonville, I discovered my baggage was missing. After filing a lost-baggage report, I bused to an airport hotel, only to find the restaurant had closed. All I could find was a vending machine with candy and chips, until the hotel breakfast was available the next morning.</p>
