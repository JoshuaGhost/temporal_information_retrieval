        <p>A Caution on Reaching Too Far for Yields</p>
        <p>Investors in junk-bond funds and more recently in short-term world income funds have learned the hard way what can happen when reaching for yields. They may sacrifice some principal.</p>
        <p>Still, some people, especially retirees, insist that preservation of principal is not nearly as important as high income. For them, the fund analysts at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund researchers, have another warning: buying  funds with the highest yields does not necessarily produce the highest income.</p>
        <p>In a recent study, the Morningstar analysts looked at the 50 bond funds with  the highest yields five years ago. They assumed an initial investment of $10,000 in each and then calculated how much the funds paid out to shareholders for the  five years ended 1995. Only 16 of the funds were among the top 50 in income at the end of the period.</p>
        <p>What happened? Many of the funds made hefty payouts at the expense of net asset value. And a 6.5 percent yield on a $9 share is worth less than 6 percent  on an $11 share.</p>
        <p>The net asset value shrinks when funds buy high-priced, high-coupon bonds to  increase their payouts. These bonds sell at more than their face value. As the bonds approach maturity, their prices come down toward their face value. If the  funds have already paid out the full coupon from the bonds, they must eat away at their portfolios to account for the declining value of the bonds. Hence the decline in net asset value.</p>
        <p>So if you want the maximum income, look not only for high current yield but for bond funds that have maintained a stable net asset value, Morningstar says.</p>
        <p>When Plain Vanilla Performs the Best</p>
        <p>Sometimes it pays to leave well enough alone. That was the case last year with enhanced index funds, which aim to outperform their index by making small bets on certain market segments or by using index options and futures. Only 3 of the 11 enhanced index funds based on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index that existed at the start of 1995 beat the index: Pimco Stocks Plus Institutional, Rydex Nova and ICAP Equity. The others lagged behind the index by an average of  more than four percentage points, according to analysts at Morningstar Inc..</p>
        <p>By contrast, the majority of the plain-vanilla index funds managed to approach the performance of the index, which gained 37.53 percent in 1995. The largest, Vanguard Index 500, was behind by only eight-hundredths of 1 percent.</p>
        <p>From Fidelity, A Research Service</p>
        <p>Fidelity Investments has added a research service for brokerage account customers that will cost $5 a month and include market and economic reports, as  well as stock and mutual fund data and commentary.</p>
        <p>Among the information available: research on stocks, corporate earnings projections, analyst recommendations, stock screens, mutual fund summaries and rankings, industry trends and market forecasts. In addition to research reports  on specific companies, investors can request that recommendation changes or late-breaking news on specified securities be faxed automatically.</p>
        <p>The research package is available by mail, fax or computer. Computer customers also get an index to more than 200 sites on the World Wide Web for added investment information.</p>
        <p>The $5 monthly fee will be waived for three months for customers who sign up  by Aug. 31. After that, the fee will be waived for investors who have at least $50,000 in Fidelity mutual fund or brokerage accounts on the last business day of the month or who have made at least 10 trades that generate commissions in the preceding 12 months.</p>
        <p>At the end of the year, subscribers to the service will get a review that includes the most recent research reports from the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation or Morningstar on their five largest stock or fund holdings.</p>
        <p>From Vanguard, On-Line Account Data</p>
        <p>The Vanguard Group now lets investors get detailed information about their mutual fund accounts on line. The company says it is one of the first fund groups to permit such access on America Online.</p>
        <p>Using Vanguard's account access service, investors can check their account balances, verify recent transactions, review the value of their accounts in dollars and shares and obtain information on purchases, exchanges and redemptions in the last 90 days, among other things.  Account information is updated daily using the closing share prices of the previous business day.</p>
        <p>All regular Vanguard accounts, including individual retirement accounts, are  automatically available for access. Accounts set up under employer-sponsored retirement plans can participate when the employer activates the service.</p>
        <p>To log on, shareholders must provide Social Security and account numbers before typing in a confidential password. Participants in retirement plans need  their Social Security and plan numbers and a personal identification number that they use for the telephone service that offers fund and account information. Shareholders concerned about confidentiality can block electronic access to their accounts.</p>
        <p>New Funds</p>
        <p>The Vanguard REIT Index Portfolio invests in the Morgan Stanley REIT Index, a benchmark of more than 90 publicly traded trusts that invest in about 7,000 properties in the United States. The fund's annual expense ratio is estimated at 35-hundredths of 1 percent. Investors pay a 1 percent redemption fee on shares held less than one year.</p>
        <p>Montgomery Small Cap Opportunities invests mostly in domestic companies with  a market capitalization of less than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Scudder Emerging Markets Growth aims for long-term growth of capital through  investments in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and the developing nations of Europe. To discourage short-term investments, it will levy a 2 percent redemption fee on shares held less than 12 months; the fee is waived for shares in retirement plans other than individual retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>The AIG Retiree Fund-2003 is intended to provide a guaranteed return of a shareholder's investment at maturity as long as the shares are held until 2003 and dividends and distributions are reinvested. The fund invests in a mix of zero-coupon Treasury securities and global equities. The sales charge is 4.75 percent.</p>
        <p>The Clover Capital Small Cap Value Fund invests mostly in small-company stocks whose valuations are low compared with their earnings potential. The average market capitalization of the stocks in the portfolio so far is $215 million.</p>
        <p>GMG/Seneca Capital Management in San Francisco has added four funds. Seneca Growth will mix shares of rapidly growing companies with well-established large-capitalization stocks that have paid dividends continuously for 20 years.  Mid-Cap Edge will own rapidly growing companies with market capitalizations of $500 million to $5 billion, and Seneca Bond will look for undervalued debt issues. Seneca Real Estate Securities will own shares of REIT's and other real estate-related companies. Each fund has a $10,000 minimum initial investment, but it drops to $1,000 for investors who use an automatic investment plan.</p>
