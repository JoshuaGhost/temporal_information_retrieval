        <p>The winner of U.S. Cup '96, the annual soccer tournament that is gaining in prestige and popularity, will be determined by Sunday's game in Los Angeles between the United States and Mexico after Ireland's 3-0 victory over Bolivia this afternoon at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Mexico has 4 points from its victory over Bolivia and a tie with Ireland, and the United States 3 points from its victory over Ireland and a loss to Bolivia.  This means the Americans need a victory in the final game, which will be played  at 3:30 P.M. at the Rose Bowl before an expected crowd of 90,000 and a national  television audience on ABC.</p>

        <p>The winner of U.S. Cup '96, the annual soccer tournament that is gaining in prestige and popularity, will be determined by Sunday's game in Los Angeles between the United States and Mexico after Ireland's 3-0 victory over Bolivia this afternoon at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Mexico has 4 points from its victory over Bolivia and a tie with Ireland, and the United States 3 points from its victory over Ireland and a loss to Bolivia.  This means the Americans need a victory in the final game, which will be played  at 3:30 P.M. at the Rose Bowl before an expected crowd of 90,000 and a national  television audience on ABC.</p>
        <p>United States Coach Steve Sampson will make three drastic lineup changes. He obviously needed to tinker with the group that started Wednesday night in the 2-0 loss to Bolivia in Washington. In that game, the Americans had trouble offensively until the last 30 minutes, or until Thomas Dooley was inserted into  the lineup.</p>
        <p>Dooley will start this time and his duty will be to link the midfield with the attack. With Dooley assuming that role, Claudio Reyna will move from midfield to striker in place of Joran Kirovski. The other change for the Americans will be Paul Caligiuri at left fullback in place of Jeff Agoos.</p>
        <p>The other American starters will be Mike Burns, Alexi Lalas and Barcelo Balboa on defense in front of Brad Freidel in goal; Tab Ramos, Cobi Jones and John Harkes will join Dooley in midfield, and Eric Wynalda will be alongside Reyna as the other striker.</p>
        <p>The Bolivians had a chance to win the tournament with a victory over Ireland  this afternoon and a United States-Mexico tie. But the Irish dashed that possibility quickly in the bright sunshine that bathed a crowd of 14,624.</p>
        <p>Keith O'Neill, a 20-year-old striker who plays for Norwich City in the English League, scored the first two goals, in the 12th and 26th minutes.</p>
        <p>O'Neill's first goal came on a header after a corner kick from the right side by Garreth Farrelly, and he scored the second with a shot from 12 yards away after a pass by Curtis Fleming.</p>
        <p>Ian Harte closed the scoring in the waning moments of the first half when he  leaped higher than all the Bolivians and headed Farrelly's corner kick from the  left side.</p>
        <p>Mick McCarthy, the coach of the Irish, said his team played well in all three games in the tournament and scored the three goals today mainly because of poor  defensive plays by the Bolivians, especially goalkeeper Marco Barrero.</p>
        <p>Coach Dussan Draskovic of Bolivia termed the three goals allowed by Barrero "unpardonable."</p>
        <p>One of the questions McCarthy and Draskovic were asked after the game was which team they favored in Sunday's game between the United States and Mexico.</p>
        <p>While Draskovic was diplomatic, saying that it was "an even game," McCarthy stated that he liked Mexico.</p>
        <p>"Mexico will beat U.S.A. because the U.S.A. had a bad game against Bolivia,"  McCarthy said.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>In addition to TAB RAMOS, playing for the United States in Los Angeles, and ROBERTO DONADONI, playing for Italy in the European Championship, the MetroStars will be without NICOLA CARICOLA and possibly RUBEN DARIO HERNANDEZ in Sunday's Major League Soccer meeting with the visiting San Jose Clash. Caricola will sit  out a one-game suspension for his ejection in Sunday's 4-0 loss to Los Angeles,  while Hernandez is bothered by a groin injury he suffered in practice this week.</p>
