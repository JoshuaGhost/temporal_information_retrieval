        <p>MORE than a decade of argument and millions of dollars have washed over 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and New York State's project for the  redevelopment the block is only just beginning. By now some planner or preservationist could be expected to have at least walked through the oldest building on the block, designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White, and later transformed into one of the most unusual restaurants in New York -- large portions of which survive.</p>
        <p>But that has still not has happened with the old Percival Apartments, at 230  West 42d Street, so it is scheduled for demolition this August to make way for Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.</p>
        <p>You would never guess from its stripped facade, now covered with a mural of  the Cat in the Hat, but 230 West 42d Street was built in 1872 as a Roman Catholic school for "boys of refined families," according to the 1893 King's Handbook of New York City.</p>
        <p>In 1882 Percival Wood Clement, a Vermont publisher, banker and railroad investor, hired McKim, Mead &amp; White to completely rebuild the school as a bachelor apartment house. They gave the Percival touches that elevated it above  the usual apartment house of the period: multipaned windows, balconies with intricate ironwork designs and a paneled main doorway, all in the character of the Esthetic Movement, then at the forefront of educated taste.</p>
        <p>We know very little about the interiors of New York's first crop of apartment houses -- only a few from the 1880's have survived intact -- but the top four floors of the six-story Percival have barely changed, a giant square of bachelor apartments separated by internal light shafts, with flooring, trim, doors and even hardware intact.</p>
        <p>The 1890 census records Wood in occupancy at his apartment house, along with  34 others, including Manuel Lopez, a tobacco merchant who kept an apartment in New York but lived in Cuba. Clement was elected Governor of Vermont in 1918.</p>
        <p>By the turn of the century theaters and restaurants were invading 42d Street. In 1907 John L. Murray took over the Percival and whitewashed its somber Victorian facade of brick and stone. The Irish-born Murray had his architect, Henry Erkins, transform the entire inside into "a villa at Pompeia . . . bedecked with the sculpture, statuary and various trophies of victories, such as a Roman general would build on his return from his conquests," according to the  journal Architecture &amp; Building. Thus the restaurant he opened as Murray's Roman Gardens contained a 30-foot-high glass mosaic tile fountain and a blue ceiling with electric "stars" -- a precursor of John Eberson's atmospheric movie theaters of the 1920's, including the Valencia in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>On the third floor was the "Pompeian Garden," with a cobble floor, latticework pergolas and two marble mosaic fountains designed by Stanford White  for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Still visible on this level are room-sized swaths of original paint, plasterwork, relief sculptures in Roman style and brilliantly colored glass mosaic tile panels of swags of fruit topped by lions'  heads.</p>
        <p>On the fourth, fifth and sixth floors Murray left most of the McKim, Mead &amp; White rooms alone, but added some trim and giant chimney breasts in outrageously sculptured, near-caricatures of the Roman style, bursting with neo-classical heads, gods and nymphs. These rooms he rented out as private dining rooms and apartments, and its audacious scale has made Murray's one of the most famous restaurants in New York City history.</p>
        <p>It appears that all of Murray's decoration on the top three floors, including a room in the Gothic style, survive intact, although they are cluttered with defunct arcade games of the 1950's, like "Pin-Up Movies," "Dive Bomber" and "Voice-O-Graph," a telephone booth-sized recording studio complete with Art Moderne cabinet.</p>
        <p>Murray died in 1917, and the lower two floors of his gardens were erased in the 1920's for another tenant: Hubert's Museum. Today it might play as hip art at the Whitney, but Hubert's rang the death knell for respectable entertainment  on 42d Street. According to the theater historian Brooks McNamara, Hubert's combined a freak show and penny arcade with the famous flea circus of Professor  William Heckler and his son Roy. The flea circus closed around 1965, replaced by peep show videos and, in the basement, small booths with timed windows facing a  central area with nude women.  Upstairs the private rooms of Murray's Roman Gardens became a notorious brothel of young men, The Barracks.</p>
        <p>It was just such operations that spurred on New York State's 42d Street Development Project, which is now beginning to remake the street and even the neighborhood. For historic-preservation concerns, the project has continued to rely on the conclusions of a 1981 consultant's report. In evaluating the interiors and exteriors of 78 structures in the area, the investigators did not  bother to determine the designer or even the date of 59 -- one of which is the Percival.</p>
        <p>According to Rebecca Robertson, president of the project, no one has even looked at the interiors of the building above the third floor, which is accessible only by ladder. She says that the state will photograph and perhaps salvage some of the last remains of Murray's Roman fantasy, but that demolition  will proceed in August.</p>
