        <p>The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday in reaction to a bomb blast in Saudi Arabia but weakened against European currencies as optimism faded for interest rate cuts in Germany and Italy.</p>
        <p>Currency traders feared the repercussions of the Saudi blast could destabilize the Persian Gulf and hurt Japan, which depends on Saudi oil.</p>
        <p>Trading was light ahead of today's meeting of officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations in France. Traders were reluctant to make any major moves because of the possibility that the summit meeting might produce news that would affect exchange rates.</p>
        <p>"When you have all those officials in one place for a couple of days, there are bound to be some statements coming out," said Elena Shperling, chief dealer  at the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch.</p>
        <p>In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 109.42 yen, up from 108.95 on Tuesday. The dollar traded at 1.5257 marks, down from 1.5292 marks. The British pound was quoted at $1.5407, up from $1.5393.</p>
        <p>The dollar rallied in Asian dealings on the news of the deadly truck bombing  at a United States military housing complex in Saudi Arabia, a leading oil exporter. But the dollar weakened later in Europe after the governor of the Bank of Italy, Antonio Fazio, doused hopes for lower Italian interest rates, telling  a meeting of Italian bankers he wanted to see more evidence that inflation had fallen below 4 percent, as preliminary data indicated last week. Final figures are due July 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio's remarks weakened the Italian bond market and dragged down the lira against the mark and other European currencies. The strength of the mark indirectly weakened the dollar.</p>
        <p>The mark derived further strength against the dollar from the likelihood that the Bundesbank would not reduce German interest rates at the regular meeting of  its policy-making council today.</p>
        <p>That view was reinforced after Reimut Jochimsen, a senior Bundesbank policy maker and head of the regional central bank based in Dusseldorf, told a German news agency that the central bank had already taken bold steps in April to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there was a minority view that the Bundesbank might make a small reduction in its securities repurchase rate.</p>
