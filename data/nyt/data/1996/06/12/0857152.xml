        <p>The MCI Communications Corporation and the Intel Corporation teamed up yesterday to sell a combination of products and services that are aimed at helping businesses publish information on the World Wide Web. MCI planned to market the product, called NetworkMCI Webmaker, to small and medium-sized businesses. At a starting price of about $10,000, businesses could purchase preconfigured computers, based on Intel's Pentium Pro chip, and software to establish a secure Internet presence. MCI and Intel hope to save companies the trouble of assembling various communications links, computers and other products themselves.</p>
