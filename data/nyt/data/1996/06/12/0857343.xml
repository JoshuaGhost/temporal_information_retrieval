        <p>The fragile peace in Chechnya was disrupted again today when two powerful sets of explosions rocked a convoy of Chechen rebel leaders as they returned from a negotiating session with their Russian counterparts.</p>
        <p>No one was killed in the blasts, which came came less than a day after the two sides signed a peace treaty intended to hasten the withdrawal of Russian soldiers from the secessionist southern region.</p>
        <p>Although fighting has never really stopped since war broke out there more than 18 months ago, the peace treaty, and the appearance of a resolution to the ruinous conflict, has been a cornerstone of President Boris N. Yeltsin's campaign for re-election.</p>
        <p>''This was an act against the peace process,'' said Tim Guldimann, the international mediator who has been most responsible for bringing the two sides back to the negotiating table after many false starts. ''But the talks will go on.''</p>
        <p>This was intended to be a day of triumph in Chechnya. The first Russian troops began to withdraw from the region, and on Monday it was agreed that most of the other 30,000 Russian soldiers would leave by September. But as has happened many times in the past, violence left a cloud over the talks, placing Mr. Yeltsin's repeated promises of peace there in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>The first explosion came as a group of more than 50 cars drove toward Grozny, the Chechen capital, from Ingushetia, where the negotiations have been held. The second one came closer to the capital, damaging the car carrying Mr. Guldimann, who was not hurt. Six people required medical treatment.</p>
        <p>Chechen rebels, who see peace as capitualation, were blamed by Russian officials for the blasts. The Chechen separatists blamed the leader of the Moscow-installed regional government. But no group claimed responsibility for the bombings and their source was impossible to confirm.</p>
        <p>''This was a dirty terrorist act,'' said Movladi Udugov, the spokesman for the Chechen separatists. ''This was not sanctioned by our people at all.'' He said the talks would continue.</p>
