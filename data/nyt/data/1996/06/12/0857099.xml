        <p>GO ahead. Make the comparison. Chicago versus any champion previously recognized as great. I'll buy it. Any team with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the ability to relentlessly pressure the ball and the Bulls' offensive versatility can stand the test. But a matchup that might, on the whole, better define the brand of basketball played in decades past in comparison to what's being served up now would be this Seattle team against the SuperSonics of 1978-79.</p>
        <p>That's the team this city celebrates as its only champion in major professional  sports, the Sonics of Gus Williams, of Dennis Johnson, of Jack Sikma, of the league's all-time winningest coach, Lenny Wilkens. Beat the Washington Bullets in five games one year after losing to the Bullets in seven. Not a team given much historical acclaim, as it was sandwiched between Bill Walton's Portland championship in 1977 and Magic Johnson's bow in the finals with the Lakers in 1980, the standard line of demarcation between the National Basketball Association as sublime TV and a league that could not have paid its way onto network prime time. "If we hadn't gotten hurt, they probably wouldn't have gotten out of the West,"  said the old Portland coach, Jack Ramsay. "But Seattle was a very good team." Much better than this Seattle team, that's for sure. The contemporary N.B.A. hypes its athletes as better than ever, and that's certainly true if you're talking about George Mikan in 1952. But consider these  matchups from a team 17 years dead against George Karl's 64-victory crew that has one more opportunity tonight to save face against the Bulls: Sikma posting up against Ervin Johnson. Gus Williams pulling up for his jumper against Hersey  Hawkins. The young Dennis Johnson defending against Gary Payton. Lonnie Shelton  and Paul Silas beating up on Shawn Kemp. Fred Brown coming off the bench to light up Vincent Askew. No contest. That Seattle team was a far more balanced and better-functioning unit than these new-age Sonics, the touted creation of an expanded, diluted league, packaged and promoted like $140 sneakers that cost $12 to make. Kemp and Payton, to start with. These are talented young players, no question, who may or may not grow and come back to the finals some day with a real chance  to win. But they are not great basketball players right now, just because Reebok, or some other planetary enterprise, tells us they are. While Dennis Rodman has been having the playoffs of his most peculiar life and marketing himself in a dozen different hair colors, Karl had until yesterday done himself and his team no favors by counting Rodman's alleged flops as if they were carjackings. Finally, Rod Thorn of the N.B.A. office more or less told Karl to forget about Rodman and start computing his team's assist-to-turnover ratio, as compared to the Bulls'. The Sonics have 40 assists and 55 turnovers in three games. The other guys' corresponding numbers are 70 and 33. That, in a nutshell, explains why the Bulls as a team are beating the stuffing out of the Sonics as a team, and that includes the owners, front offices, kitchen help and, by George, the coaching staffs. Karl yesterday lectured the news media about dwelling on statistics and suggested we pay more attention to chemistry. All right, let's put it this way:  The experienced Bulls run their offense with poetic ball and body movement, while the Sonics are often guilty of abusing the most basic basketball tenet --  don't leave your feet to pass. The most telling play of the series, in fact, was the first-quarter sequence of  Game 3 when Payton dribbled into a trap on the left wing and went up in the air  to find an open man, before desperately turning to fire the ball back outside. He threw it right to Jordan. Making immediate peripheral eye contact with Pippen, Jordan wrapped a perfect bounce pass around his back, leading Pippen out of the pack for a breakaway stuff. To be sure, a forever highlight. Karl and the Sonics are right about one thing: The Bulls have turned the finals  into a classroom of higher education. Lesson One: The difference between 72 victories and 64 may not necessarily be just eight. "It's been a good run, with a lot of fire and a lot of happiness, and now we're  on the road to hell," Karl said, demonstrating why he was named yesterday to the N.B.A.'s All-Interview Team. His team was beaten so convincingly in Game 3 that I am prepared to speculate that if Jordan were to have brought the Bulls into the finals and then taken off for a tour of Scotland's golf courses with Richard Esquinas, this still would be a series that would handicap no better for Seattle than a tossup. Don't laugh. Two years ago, when Horace Grant was in Rodman's position, when Toni Kukoc was a rookie, when Luc Longley was just beginning the transfusion to  empty his body of Minnesota Timberwolves blood, the Jordan-less Bulls won 53 games and were one Hue Hollins breath away from beating the Knicks. They know how to play. The Sonics are student-finalists. That's the best way to measure a  team against those that came before.</p>
