        <p>Sheila Frahm, a moderate Republican who was the Lieutenant Governor of Kansas, was sworn in this afternoon to replace Senator Bob Dole. Ms. Frahm, a corn and wheat farmer from rural northwest Kansas, was appointed to fill Mr. Dole's seat by Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas, who is also a Republican. But she must run for election in November to hold on to the seat. A supporter of abortion rights, Ms. Frahm faces a challenge in the Republican primary in August from Representative Sam Brownback, an opponent of abortion who is supported by conservative Christian groups. Ms. Frahm's Washington initiation began early today with a $1,000-a-person breakfast sponsored by Mr. Graves and Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, and held in the board room of the Association of American Railroads. For political action committees, the fund-raising arms of businessess and associations, the cost of the breakfast was $2,500 to $5,000.</p>
