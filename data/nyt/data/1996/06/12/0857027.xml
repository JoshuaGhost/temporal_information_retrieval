        <p>The program was as it should have been when Alonzo King's Lines Contemporary  Ballet danced on Sunday night. Earlier in the week, this San Francisco company had scheduled a new work by Mr. King called "Handel Pas de Deux" as part of its  engagement at the Joyce Theater. But an injury sustained by Muriel Maffre, the French ballerina for whom it was created, prevented it from being shown. By the weekend, Ms. Maffre had recovered and was able to perform the duet with Benjamin Pierce as her partner. Both she and Mr. Pierce appeared with Mr. King's troupe as guest artists from the San Francisco Ballet. The pas de deux was well  worth waiting for.</p>

        <p>The program was as it should have been when Alonzo King's Lines Contemporary  Ballet danced on Sunday night. Earlier in the week, this San Francisco company had scheduled a new work by Mr. King called "Handel Pas de Deux" as part of its  engagement at the Joyce Theater. But an injury sustained by Muriel Maffre, the French ballerina for whom it was created, prevented it from being shown. By the weekend, Ms. Maffre had recovered and was able to perform the duet with Benjamin Pierce as her partner. Both she and Mr. Pierce appeared with Mr. King's troupe as guest artists from the San Francisco Ballet. The pas de deux was well  worth waiting for.</p>
        <p>Mr. King knows traditional ballet technique. But, fortunately, he does not tie himself to balletic conventions. A choreographer with a mind and imagination of  his own, he has developed a style that emphasizes rootedness as well as springy  leaps. "Handel Pas de Deux," to excerpts from Handel's Trio Sonatas (Op. 2), began with both dancers in hunched positions at the back of the stage. They moved gradually forward with measured and slightly weighted steps in misty  lighting by Lisa Pinkham. Yet she made the stage brighten as they progressed. The steps also broadened in scale and, at one point, when Mr. Pierce swung her about, Ms. Maffre displayed high extensions. Although most of the music was slow, the tempo quickened at the conclusion, and Ms. Maffre and Mr. Pierce now seemed to be two people who had successfully completed a journey toward a state  of harmony. The program included repeat performances of Mr. King's taut "String Quartet" and his more discursive "Sacred Text."</p>
