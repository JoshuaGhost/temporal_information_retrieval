        <p>Michael Jordan is not sure how to answer this one. If he says yes, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird might differ. If he says no, he is backing down. "Are we the greatest team of all time?" muses the Chicago Bulls' supernova guard. "Well . . . " How can anyone be sure after this championship series, when it is no longer Bulls versus SuperSonics, but rather Jordan and his teammates against National Basketball Association history. As Chicago looked to close out the finals with Seattle in Game 4 on Wednesday night at Key Arena, the overriding theme was not what little chance the Sonics had but how Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the hired help would be construed next to the league's other great teams. The Lakers always had the Celtics for six or seven games to measure themselves by. The Bulls of the early 90's had the Pistons and the Knicks. Ali had Frazier. Martina had Chrissie. These Bulls have . . . these Bulls. Either they're simply too polished to have their greatness quantified or no one  will ever know how good they are because they were never tested. They beat the rickety Knicks in five games, swept away some big kids in mouse ears from Orlando in four games and are on the brink of removing Seattle's voicebox, also  in four. The last playground war they took part in came three weekends ago in New York, where a split at Madison Square Garden became the only blemish on their 14-1 post-season record. "The fact that there is no comparison says it all," Pippen said. "And that is: We're the greatest team of all time. That's my opinion." It is one shared by many outside of the organization. With Nate McMillan doubtful with a strained back for Game 4 and the squawking of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp surpassing their play, the Sonics will become the second 60-victory team to be eliminated by Chicago in four games en route to a title. Only one other team in N.B.A. annals has accomplished that feat: the Bulls of 1993, who beat the Knicks (60 victories) and the Suns (62). A sweep would also mean a 15-1 post-season mark, the best during a championship run. But, really, aside from the Knicks, there were no decent scrums, no great test in the post-season for this collection of basketball players who won a league-record 72 games during the regular season. "That's not the Bulls' fault," said Bill Walton, the NBC analyst who played on the 1986 Celtic team that is considered among the league's best. "That's everyone else's fault. They have no control over who they play." Ron Harper, who did not start Game 3 because of a bruised knee, is expected to start in Game 4. Seattle Coach George Karl will sit down center Ervin Johnson in favor of Sam Perkins or Frank Brickowski, going with either more offense and physical play. In other developments today, Phil Jackson, who is essentially cashing in his last bargaining chip on Wednesday, made it clear he is not opposed to taking a year's sabbatical instead of returning to coaching next season. He did not rule out coaching in Europe or taking a job as an announcer for a year, like Pat Riley did in between coaching the Lakers and the Knicks, or merely retreating to Montana to mellow out. The options, of course, become more  diverse -- Jackson has yet to mention becoming a parasailing instructor -- the longer the Bulls wait to sign their free-agent coach to a short-term deal that would not be insulting, one for John Calipari and Riley money. Meanwhile, between diatribes on how great this Bulls team is compared with how great those other Bulls teams were, Jordan decided that "great" was being thrown around a little too freely, considering Game 4 had not yet begun. "We can taste it," Jordan said. "It's definitely there. But we still have one hurdle to go over. Sometimes that last hurdle is taller than all the others when you get to the end." Jordan, who has said he only wants to play with Jackson as his coach, went on to say that as loyal as he is, he will only go so far. "Tell Phil I'm not going to Montana," he said, with a mischievous smile. Neither the coach nor the star player of perhaps the greatest team in league history mentioned an eventual trip to Springfield, Mass. Like their blistering run through the finals this season, some things in this business you just take for granted.</p>
