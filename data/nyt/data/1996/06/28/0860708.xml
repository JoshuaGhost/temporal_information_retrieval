        <p>The Florida Supreme Court today narrowly upheld a state liability law widely  viewed as a significant legal threat to the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>In a 4-to-3 decision, the court cleared the way for Gov. Lawton Chiles to proceed with his lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers that seeks to reclaim the cost of treating Medicaid patients who have smoking-related diseases.</p>
        <p>Last year, Florida spent about $387 million on Medicaid patients with cancer, emphysema and other diseases linked to cigarettes, state officials said. The state is expected to make a claim of more than $1 billion against the major  tobacco companies when the lawsuit goes to trial in a West Palm Beach circuit courtroom in August 1997, said Harold Lewis, the Governor's inspector general.</p>
        <p>Governor Chiles, who was on a trade mission in Spain, issued a statement saying he was "elated" by the court decision to uphold the Medicaid Third-Party  Liability Act, which when last modified in 1994 stripped the tobacco industry of its traditional legal defenses.</p>
        <p>Tobacco industry officials, who had challenged the constitutionality of the law, also claimed a victory. They noted that the court ruled that the state would have to individually identify every Medicaid recipient in the lawsuit, rather than suing for damages as a group.</p>
        <p>"We are delighted that the Florida Supreme Court has agreed with our position that this lawsuit must focus on individual Medicaid recipients," said Charles R. Wall, a senior vice president for Philip Morris U.S.A.</p>
        <p>State officials said the court ruling was significant in that it left largely intact the 1994 liability law that stripped the tobacco industry of using legal  defenses like the argument that smokers assume part of the risk when they use cigarettes.</p>
        <p>The law also eliminated the defense of comparative negligence and allowed the state to use statistical evidence in making its case for repayment of the Medicaid expenses.</p>
        <p>Florida is one of nine states suing the tobacco industry to recover public health-care costs. But legal experts say Florida is unique and has the strongest case because of the state liability law.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court did strike down several provisions of the law. The justices said the state could only use the law to recover damages since July 1, 1994, rejecting the state's effort to sue for damages as far back as 1990.</p>
        <p>The court's requirement that the state identify individual Medicaid recipients in the lawsuit could complicate the legal proceedings.</p>
        <p>"It's going to be very difficult for the state to come forward with the identity of each and every Medicaid recipient that they are claiming damages for," said Jodi Chase, general counsel for Associated Industries of Florida, a major business lobby that had also opposed the liability law.</p>
