        <p>The Newark City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to confirm Joseph J. Santiago as Police Director, but some members say they need more time  to decide. On Wednesday, Mayor Sharpe James named Mr. Santiago to fill the job vacated by William R. Celester, who was indicted last week on corruption charges. Mr. Santiago, who is serving as acting chief, was convicted in 1993 of  a disorderly-person offense for assaulting a jail guard, and in 1995 of using offensive and threatening language against a subordinate.</p>
        <p>Mildred Crump, a Councilwoman at Large, said she had reservations about his  nomination. "We need to have someone who is squeaky clean," she said. Two others among the Council's nine members said they were undecided.</p>
