        <p>Breaking a chain of secular leadership in Turkey since since the founding of  the republic in 1923, the leader of the nation's Islamic party became Prime Minister yesterday.</p>
        <p>Necmettin Erbakan, the new Prime Minister and leader of the Welfare Party, formed a coalition Government with the former Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, who  will serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.</p>
        <p>President Suleyman Demirel approved the new Government after meeting with Mr. Erbakan late yesterday. Emerging from his meeting with the President, Mr. Erbakan said: "I have very good news for you. A new Government has been formed."</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Erbakan automatically assumed the mantle of Prime Minister, Turkey's Parliament must give the new Government a vote of confidence. Mr. Erbakan's Welfare Party and Mrs. Ciller's True Path Party have a majority in the 550-seat Parliament. Some True Path deputies, however, have hinted that they might vote against the coalition because they cannot bear to help bring an Islamic Government to power.</p>
        <p>A vote is expected within two weeks, and in that time there is likely to be intense pressure on members of Parliament from both supporters and opponents of  Mr. Erbakan.</p>
        <p>"I hope we can get a healthy majority, without any confidence-vote problem, to do our duty firmly, tirelessly and with belief," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan has suggested that he favors Turkish withdrawal from NATO and closer ties with Iran and with militant Islamic groups like Hamas, which is waging a guerrilla war against Israel.</p>
        <p>In a campaign speech in December, the Welfare Party leader said, "We will set up an Islamic United Nations, an Islamic NATO and an Islamic version of the European Union." He also promised, "We will create an an Islamic currency."</p>
        <p>And he has said that Turks "do not want to be represented by women." Not one  of the 158 members of Parliament from his party is a woman.</p>
        <p>Turkey's resolutely secular military, however, would look with great disfavor on actions that would turn the country away from the West.  Army officers have seized power three times since 1960 when they disapproved of elected governments.</p>
        <p>The modern Turkish state, founded in 1923, has held secularism and pro-Western foreign policies as fundamental principles.</p>
        <p>And more than 3,000 American military personnel are stationed in Turkey, with the largest group based near the southeastern town of Incirlik, where they help  direct operations to protect Kurds in northern Iraq. Others are stationed at several NATO bases around the country.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ciller's decision to join a coalition with Mr. Erbakan was startling in  view of her resolutely secularist ideals. She is an American-educated economist  who only a few months ago warned that a government led by Mr. Erbakan would "bury the country in darkness."</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan's party took first place in national elections in December, with  only 21.38 percent of the vote. Although nearly 80 percent of voters supported secularist candidates, splits among other parties left Mr. Erbakan at the top.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ciller, who had no comment on the most recent development, is fighting several corruption charges, and has refused to explain what she did with $6.5 million that she withdrew from a secret Government fund shortly before she left  office last year. The new coalition would not only give her a chance to hold a measure of power, but could also win her enough support in Parliament to head off further investigations.</p>
        <p>Turkey has been without a stable government since September, when Mrs. Ciller's coalition collapsed.</p>
        <p>After the elections, Mrs. Ciller formed a coalition with another center-right leader, Mesut Yilmaz. It collapsed after just three months. The partners supported similar policies, but their intense personal rivalry made it impossible for them to work together, and paved the way for Mr. Erbakan's rise.</p>
        <p>His critics say he poses a mortal threat to secularism and to the balance of  power in the Middle East.  Some political analysts, however, doubt that he will  move quickly to reverse Turkey's traditional course.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan is a German-educated engineer who has been active in politics for 30 years. He was a Cabinet minister in the mid-1970's, but after the 1980 military coup he was imprisoned on charges that he sought to undermine secularism and submit the country to Islamic rule.</p>
        <p>In an interview this month with the German magazine Der Spiegel, Mr. Erbakan  praised Hamas, which the United States State Department considers a terrorist group, saying it is made up of "people who want to rescue a country that is occupied and in which they must live under tyranny."</p>
        <p>"It is a typical mistake of the West to call them terrorists," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan also praised Iran for "resisting the power of the West." He described the Sudan, which is on the State Department's list of countries that actively support terrorism, as "a victim of plunder at the hands of the West."</p>
        <p>He seems to have the confidence that his coalition will survive. "The other parties are finished," Mr. Erbakan asserted. "In the first place, they have no identity, no character.  They only want to imitate the West.  That is a sickness. Their second mistake is their strongly capitalistic economic program,  which helps a very small elite and leaves the rest of our people in misery. And  their third mistake is that they are against religion. These parties have been hostile to religion for 50 years. They act as if there is no such thing as religion."</p>
