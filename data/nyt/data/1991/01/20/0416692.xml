        <p>To the Editor: Regarding Norman P. Goldman's letter and the response from Continental Airlines (Travel, Nov. 25), I too obtained a "voluntary denied boarding compensation" ticket and was never informed of the restrictions on its use.</p>
        <p>On numerous occasions I attempted to use the ticket. Each time I called (within seven days of my anticipated departure as supposedly required), I had no problem obtaining a seat until I said that I had a complimentary ticket (Continental's term for voluntary denied boarding compensation ticket), and all of a sudden no seats were available for reservation. This went on for almost a year. Because I did not want the ticket to expire, I found it necessary to fly standby. I was told that no reserved seats were available for passengers with complimentary tickets, yet each flight was less than half full.</p>
        <p>During the layover in Denver, many flights were overbooked. At different gates I heard the attendant announce the availability of free round-trip tickets good anywhere in the continental United States for giving up a seat. At no time did any of the announcements mention the restrictions. In fact, when a passenger asked if there were any restrictions, the reply was "There are no restrictions with these tickets!" NAOMI R. BERGWERK New York, N.Y. Don Welsh, staff vice president, airport services, Continental Airlines, replies: Our gate agents are to insure that each volunteer is fully aware of the restrictions associated with complimentary tickets, and our quality assurance program indicates a high degree of compliance with this policy. Use of these tickets is "capacity controlled," meaning that reservations are booked in a particular category of seats, which are limited in number. However, the appropriate category is available on more than 80 percent of flights during the seven-day window prior to departure. Moreover, the tickets can be used on nearly any flight on a standby basis, since only a very small percentage of flights depart with every seat occupied. These free tickets are a good value, as they actually carry fewer restrictions than several types of tickets purchased by travelers. They are particularly valuable to travelers who like the flexibility afforded by traveling standby, since they carry no advance booking requirements or penalties for changing travel dates.</p>
