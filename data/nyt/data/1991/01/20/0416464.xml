        <p>Prompted by concerns that live scenes from the war front might frighten children more accustomed to seeing the skirmishes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, ABC News took time yesterday morning to explain the war to youngsters during a special report on the Persian Gulf conflict.</p>
        <p>After apologizing to young viewers for pre-empting the cartoons they usually watch on Saturday, Peter Jennings, the ABC anchor, said, "Kids should also remember that this is all happening far away and that there is no danger to them at home."</p>
        <p>In the weeks leading up to the war in the Persian Gulf, ABC News executives discussed how they would deal with images that might be disturbing to children.</p>
        <p>Patrick M. Roddy of ABC, executive producer of "World News This Morning" and the news portions of "Good Morning America," said the slaying of Chinese protesters in Beijing in June 1989 had made ABC more sensitive to the effect of violent breaking news on children. The Chinese crackdown was seen at American breakfast tables.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to make sure that our coverage of this war was not only up to the minute and accurate and aggressive, but that it be all those things and still not add to the nightmares of children," he said.</p>
        <p>Twelve-year-old Kelly Greenwood, daughter of Bill Greenwood, an ABC News correspondent, helped her father edit a news segment for children that explained troop strengths and the importance of the Middle East region in the world economy while assuring children that it was normal to be upset about the war there.</p>
