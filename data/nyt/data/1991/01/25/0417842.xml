        <p>Leftist rebels today accused the Salvadoran armed forces of killing 15 peasants this week in a village north of San Salvador.</p>
        <p>"This criminal action is a typical terrorist operation of the armed forces, tending to intimidate the population," the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria said: "We reject categorically this charge. I don't think it is a serious position. It is pure speculation." Mr. Santamaria added that a full investigation was under way.</p>
        <p>The American-backed Government of President Alfredo Cristiani, the military and human rights organizations said that investigations were under way to find out who carried out the killings of seven men and eight women of the Aragon family in El Zapote, a village five miles north of the capital.</p>
        <p>At least five men, dressed in black and with their faces covered with scarfs, carried out the slayings with rifles and knives in the early hours of Tuesday, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>The rebel group presented no proof to back its accusation, but said the killings were carried out "taking advantage of the fact that world attention is concentrated on the war in the Persian Gulf."</p>
