        <p>Dr. Eugene P. Gross, a theoretical physicist who had been a professor at Brandeis University since 1956, died on Tuesday at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. He was 64 years old and lived in Waltham, Mass.</p>
        <p>He died of pancreatic cancer, the university said.</p>
        <p>At his death Dr. Gross held the Edward and Gertrude Swartz chair in theoretical physics. He had been a full professor since 1961, was twice chairman of the physics department and was a former chairman of the university's Council of the School of Science.</p>
        <p>His research, reported in more than 80 published papers, focused on ways to determine the properties of systems containing very large numbers of particles, like quantum liquids, plasmas and solids. He also conducted studies on the kinetic theory of gases and on the properties of liquid helium.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gross received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Princeton. Before going to Brandeis he was a Carnegie Fellow at Harvard, a reseach associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an assistant professor at Syracuse.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Sonja Keller, a research biochemist at the Shriver Institute in Waltham; a son, Mark, a professor of architecture and civil engineering at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and a brother, Theodore, president of Roosevelt Univesity in Chicago.</p>
