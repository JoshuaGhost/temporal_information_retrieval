        <p>Oil production by OPEC kept rising in December, and the group's output for 1990 was the highest in 10 years, despite the global boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait, according to a survey released today.</p>
        <p>Led by Saudi Arabia and Iran, several OPEC members increased production significantly in recent months to offset the daily loss of about four million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude embargoed during the Persian Gulf crisis, the Middle East Economic Survey said.</p>
        <p>The survey, published weekly in Cyprus by independent economic researchers, said Iraq's production for the year was down 27 percent from 1989. It fell from 1.75 million barrels a day before the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 to 450,000 barrels a day afterward, used only for local consumption, the survey said.</p>
        <p>Crude output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in December was estimated at 23.86 million barrels a day, up 230,000 barrels from November.</p>
