        <p>The Warner Brothers film studio said today that it had formed a partnership with a group of European entertainment companies to produce and distribute at least 20 films.</p>
        <p>Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, said the deal was the largest between American and European film makers. Under its terms, the films will be financed and produced by Regency International Pictures, a Dutch company run by Arnon Milchan, an entrepreneur who produced the hit film "Pretty Woman."</p>
        <p>Regency has agreed to spend at least $600 million to produce the films. The financing is to be provided by Regency and the two other European partners in the group, Canal Plus, a French pay-television company, and Scriba &amp; Deyhle, a German motion picture and television production company.</p>
        <p>Warner Brothers will pay for the marketing of the films in return for the right to distribute them to theaters and later in videocassette form. The companies said they were still negotiating on foreign television and pay-television rights. The marketing costs for 20 films could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The deal is the latest in a series of partnerships and financing arrangements that have brought together entertainment companies from around the world. Hollywood has been looking abroad in recent years for backing for its pictures. The industry is also increasingly seeking foreign partners in the creative end of the business, reflecting the growth of European and Asian markets for films.</p>
        <p>"This agreement unquestionably represents one of the most significant international relationships in our industry, a relationship that we all feel will serve as the model for others in the years ahead," said Terry Semel, the president of Warner Brothers. "It is also a union that represents a natural extension of Time Warner's philosophy of globalization, based on the understanding that long-term competitive success can be achieved only through major alliances and a presence in all the world's most important markets."
