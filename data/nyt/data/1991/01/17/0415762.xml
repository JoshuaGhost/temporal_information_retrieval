        <p>SOME analysts regard Nestle S.A., the world's largest food company, as a haven for investors during this period of geopolitical tension and economic slowdown, even though it has been hurt by the weak dollar and tough competition in the United States.</p>
        <p>The way these analysts see it, if recession grips the world and despite the war in the Middle East, everyone will continue to need food. This means millions of people will continue to buy Nestle products, which include Nestle infant formula, Taster's Choice coffee and Stouffer frozen foods.</p>
        <p>"If there is a worldwide recession, even food manufacturers will come under some pressure, but nothing like some other industries," said Deborah Rees, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson, a London-based brokerage.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rees sees Nestle as a good "defensive" stock, one that will be less volatile than many other stocks should the war drive down the markets.</p>
        <p>John L. Parker, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, also has a "buy" recommendation for Nestle. "The key to Nestle's short-term performance is the degree to which the markets want to be in a safe haven situation," he said. "Beyond that, over the longer term, there is a pretty positive earnings story in Nestle."</p>
        <p>Over the last year, however, Nestle, with $38 billion in 1989 revenues, has not seemed like much of a haven. The company has been bruised and beaten by the strong performance of the Swiss franc and the plunge of the dollar. One-fourth of Nestle's sales are in North America, so the company, based in Vevey, Switzerland, has been hit hard when its American sales are translated into Swiss francs.</p>
        <p>A year ago, management was dreaming of a double-digit earnings increase for 1990, but now manyanalysts expect an earnings drop of more than 5 percent. Profits are expected to slide, notwithstanding a 3 percent increase in sales volume last year. The main reason for the drop in earnings is the Swiss franc's 15 percent rise against most currencies last year. Nestle has also been hurt by Brazil's economic crisis and by soaring fuel bills.</p>
        <p>Michael Oertli, a Zurich-based analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, changed his "buy" recommendation to "hold" last November when Nestle announced that its revenues were down almost 6 percent for the first 10 months of 1990 and that its net profits would probably fall for the year. Mr. Oertli is keeping Nestle on "hold," because "the whole situation of the stock market is that you don't have to buy Nestle because Nestle will not outperform the market." While Nestle might have less downward vulnerability than some other stocks, Mr. Oertli does not see huge near-term upward potential.</p>
        <p>He forecasts that earnings per share dropped 11 percent drop for 1990, to 585 Swiss francs, or about $455, but he sees earnings per share climbing 8 percent this year, to 631 Swiss francs. Many analysts say Nestle's profits will snap back if the Swiss franc does not continue rising.</p>
        <p>"For the long-term investor, we have always said, 'Don't sell Nestle,' " Mr. Oertli said. In yesterday's trading in Zurich, Nestle shares closed at 7,010 Swiss francs, down 50 francs on the day.</p>
        <p>Despite the currency fluctuations, many analysts, including Ms. Rees and Mr. Parker, say Nestle's chief executive, Helmut Maucher, has put the company on a solid course. The company's revenues rose 21 percent, to 48 billion Swiss francs in 1989, and its profits rose 17.2 percent, or 656 francs a share, to 2.41 billion Swiss francs. Theseincreases were helped by a 12 percent drop in the Swiss franc in 1989 and a 4 percent jump in sales volume.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Nestle bought Buitoni, the pasta maker, and Rowntree, Britain's largest chocolate maker. Nestle is integrating both into its worldwide network, hoping to realize economies of scale and growth. To challenge Kellogg's dominance in ready-to-eat cereals, Nestle set up a joint venture a year ago with General Mills to produce and market cereals in Europe. Then in December it set up a joint venture with Coca-Cola to cooperate in bottling and distributing Nestea iced tea and Nescafe iced coffee in cans. Analysts say both joint ventures have great promise.</p>
        <p>Last November Nestle announced it would consolidate its American operations -- Carnation, Stouffer and Ohio-based Nestle Enterprises -- in the hope of achieving efficiencies and making its operations more responsive to the market. At the moment, Nestle's biggest headaches are coming from the United States, which has moved into a recession, while Nestle's other important markets, Asia and Europe, continue to grow. Nestle's pet food and frozen food businesses are coming under pressure as shoppers turn to less expensive alternatives and competitors turn up the pressure. Stouffer used to have 50 percent of the American market for frozen meals, but its market share and margins have been slashed because of tough competition from other frozen entrees, like Weight Watchers and Conagra's Healthy Choice.</p>
        <p>"The high margins businesses, those with convenience, are getting hit the most right now," said Bertrand Facon, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the London-based investment bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Facon's recommendation for Nestle is "hold." He is not pessimistic about Nestle's chances, but since he expects world stock markets to rebound, he says: "People may turn to more cyclical stocks. People who used Nestle in terms of protection could go back to stocks that have more upside potential."</p>
        <p>The lesson: If you see the glass half empty, you might buy Nestle. If you see it half full, you might look for more promising, cyclical stocks.</p>
