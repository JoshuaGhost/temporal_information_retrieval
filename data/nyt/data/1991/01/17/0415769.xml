        <p>A Presidential advisory group recommended to President Bush today the creation for the first time of national examinations for elementary and high school students.</p>
        <p>The President's Education Policy Advisory Committee, a diverse group of 25 educators and business leaders, met with Mr. Bush for 50 minutes to discuss their recommendations and to call on him to "regain the crown" as the education President that he has said he wishes to be. The recommendations, which are not yet in final form, carry no legal weight, and it remains to be seen what Mr. Bush can or will do with them.</p>
        <p>A White House spokesman said the meeting gave the President the opportunity to hear from a number of leaders. "He hasn't offered any position yet," the official said. "It's clear in the past that we do need to measure progress. But he hasn't made up his mind. This wasn't a decision meeting."</p>
        <p>A Department of Education background paper released last August said the Administration was willing to support some form of national testing as long as the Federal Government's role was limited.  Monitoring Report Urged</p>
        <p>The recommendations urge Mr. Bush to create and issue "a regular report on the tests" so school officials and parents would know how the various tests reflected whatever national standards the White House and the nation's governors develop.</p>
        <p>The establishment of national examinations would be politically sensitive. In Japan, Germany and most other industrial nations, student performance is driven by national examinations, but there has been longstanding resistance to such tests in the United States.</p>
        <p>Some states fear showing poorly compared to other states; others argue that such tests could lead to a national, standardized curriculum, perhaps in many subjects, and remove control of curriculum from state and local jurisdiction. Still others fear that such examinations could determine a person's educational and career future.</p>
        <p>"Teachers would teach to these standards," said Paul H. O'Neill, chief executive officer of the Aluminum Company of America and chairman of the advisory group. Without giving a breakdown of the vote, he said "the majority view of the committee" was to support such standards. Strong Dissenting Voice</p>
        <p>At least one panel member disagreed. Joe Nathan, senior fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, has argued that American students are already tested too much. He feels that the panel should be investigating new ways of motivating students.</p>
        <p>"The Federal Government can't just wave its hand and tell legislatures, 'Don't have your testing program' or tell local districts, 'Don't have your tests'," Mr. Nathan said. "Given the experience we've had with testing, a national test will end up stifling the most effective, the most creative and the finest teachers we have. I would find it ironic that an Administration that came in saying that it wanted to reduce the number of rules and regulations ended up imposing an extremely disruptive and negative set of tests on the country."</p>
        <p>But Mr. O'Neill and other members of the advisory group argue that national tests are the only way to reach the national education goals for the year 2000 set by the President and the governors last March.</p>
        <p>"The reason to have a national standard is to make sure we change," Mr. O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>William T. Brock, former Secretary of Labor, said that giving parents the right to choose the schools their children would attend, a policy favored by the Administration, required establishing national standards so parents would be able to determine where their children would get the best education. Testing for Job Skills</p>
        <p>The National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonprofit group, has also been considering plans to create a national examination to certify that young people have attained the skills and knowledge necessary for either further education or the job market. The Commisssion on the Skills of the American Workforce, a group of education and labor leaders, last June proposed that all 16-year-olds take a test to gain a certificate that employers could require as a job credential.</p>
        <p>The only current Federal examination program is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, widely known as NAEP. The program conducts tests in various subjects like mathematics, reading, writing and science at the fourth-, eighth- and 12th-grade levels, reporting what students know but making no judgments about what they ought to know.</p>
        <p>As a first step toward those judgments, NAEP is preparing to set national standards for its mathematics tests that would rank student achievement in fourth, eighth and 12th grades as "basic," "proficient" or "advanced," based on what a pupil should be able to do at those levels.</p>
        <p>Some have argued that these standards should be the basis of any future national test, but NAEP is having difficulty getting broad agreement within its ranks on what should constitute each achievement level.</p>
