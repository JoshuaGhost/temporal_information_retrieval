        <p>Four teams made it to Super Bowl XXV in 300,000 programs printed for the game. That was done deliberately because there was one fewer week to prepare the 260-page program this year. The program is the biggest ever for a Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Chuck Garrity Sr., managing editor of the NFL Properties Creative Services Division in Los Angeles, said today that only 200,000 of the 500,000 programs included the updated information on the Giants and the Bills, and most of those programs arrived on Friday from the printer in Wisconsin.</p>

        <p>Four teams made it to Super Bowl XXV in 300,000 programs printed for the game. That was done deliberately because there was one fewer week to prepare the 260-page program this year. The program is the biggest ever for a Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Chuck Garrity Sr., managing editor of the NFL Properties Creative Services Division in Los Angeles, said today that only 200,000 of the 500,000 programs included the updated information on the Giants and the Bills, and most of those programs arrived on Friday from the printer in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>The cover is a pullout double-page illustration of memorabilia of all the Super Bowls.</p>
        <p>"It came out all right," Garrity said. "It's just a little harder to put together because, in putting in four teams, you have to prepare eight teams with all the mug shots, rosters, roster changes, three-deeps, and how the teams were put together -- draft choices, free agents and trades -- on every team."</p>
        <p>The cutdown to four teams came late on Sunday, Jan. 13, when the conference championship teams were known. "A year ago we finished at 1:30 in the morning on our regular two-team edition," Garrity said. "On the four-team edition we finished at 7 in the morning."</p>
        <p>Film of the entire program was shipped with a courier by jet to Milwaukee on the following day and taken to the printing plant to be made into plates. The updated film for the second printing was shipped last Monday after the two Super Bowl teams were known and the pages on the 49ers and the Raiders were replaced by photographs and extra information. Parcells Staying, Maras Say</p>
        <p>The Giants' three leading executives have dismissed a report in The Orlando Sentinel that Bill Parcells will coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season. The denials came from Wellington and Tim Mara, the co-owners, and George Young, the general manager.</p>
        <p>Parcells has a year left on his contract with the Giants. He became their coach in December 1982 when Ray Perkins left to coach the University of Alabama. Perkins later became the coach of the Bucs, who dismissed him late this season.</p>
        <p>"They haven't talked to us to get permission to talk to him," Wellington Mara said. "It's another story. He's under contract to us. As far as I know, he has no intention of not fulfilling his contract."</p>
        <p>Tim Mara, Wellington's nephew, said: "He's under contract to the Giants. So if he's going to coach, he will coach for the Giants."</p>
        <p>Young said: "It's total speculation, an old story they're beating to death. Tampa Bay has said it's not interested in people under contract."</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, the 49-year-old Parcells would not address reports that he planned to retire after this season. He said only that he would do what he did after every season, sit down and decide what he wanted to do. Not-so-Sunny Florida</p>
        <p>The Giants and the Bills concluded their Super Bowl preparations today in a chilly drizzle.</p>
        <p>The Bills sat for a team photograph. Then they went through their usual Saturday short practice and did a little work with kicking teams. The Giants had their usual day-before-the-game walk-through of plays.</p>
        <p>Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former Bills quarterback, attended the Bills' practice and spoke briefly to the team.</p>
        <p>The Bills made one roster move, activating Matt Monger, a linebacker, from injured reserve to replace Marvcus Patton, a linebacker who suffered a broken leg in the playoff game against Miami. The Voice of Cosell</p>
        <p>To many viewers, Howard Cosell remains the symbol of pro football on ABC.</p>
        <p>Cosell is coming out of retirement on Sunday, sort of, to broadcast Super Bowl XXV.</p>
        <p>"I have no interest in the game," he said today. "But I'm calling it in memory of my wife for several hundred people."</p>
        <p>Cosell said he was announcing the game, off the TV, for an audience in New York that will be seeing the game, but without the sound. He will do it at a fund-raising event for Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Golden Oldies</p>
        <p>The calendar of special events for the Super Bowl weekend boasts plenty of entertainment.</p>
        <p>The highlights were scheduled for tonight and the lineup included Frank Sinatra appearing with Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme at the University of South Florida (top price, $50); Whitney Houston in concert at the Bayfront Center (VIP ticket price $100) and the Chita Rivera Florida orchestra (a bargain at $30 tops).  A Big Biscuit</p>
        <p>Cornelius Bennett, the Bills' linebacker, is known by the nickname Biscuit, and there's no hidden meaning to it.</p>
        <p>"I picked it up in third grade," he said. "A bunch of my friends would be sitting around eating and after everybody else finished, I'd grab for the leftover biscuits. Then I'd get a big plate, pour maple syrup over it and sop up the biscuits with the syrup. I'm a country boy. I still love biscuits." Roberts to the Pro Bowl</p>
        <p>William Roberts, the Giants offensive guard, has been named to the Pro Bowl game Feb. 3 in Honolulu. He will replace Mark Bortz of the Chicago Bears, who is injured.</p>
        <p>Six Giants will play in the Pro Bowl, the National Football League's all-star game. Lawrence Taylor and Pepper Johnson will be starting linebackers, Bart Oates the backup center, Sean Landeta the punter and Reyna Thompson the special-teams specialist.</p>
