        <p>AT the Morris Museum here there are shows by Harry Devlin, Robert Birmelin and John van Alstine. The lineup is probably fortuitous but, in the case of the two painters, seems calculated,; Mr. Devlin's theme being the suburban idyll, Mr. Birmelin's the urban nightmare.</p>
        <p>It must be Mr. Devlin's year, for he has not only this retrospective but also, at the Zimmerli Art Museum, a sizable show of children's book illustrations, most of them joint efforts with his wife, Wenda. The Morristown production, in which Mrs. Devlin makes a guest appearance with a portrait or two, fills the museum's glistening new wing to capacity, since Mr. Devlin has been focusing on Victorian architecture in all its eclectic glory for more than 30 years.</p>

        <p>AT the Morris Museum here there are shows by Harry Devlin, Robert Birmelin and John van Alstine. The lineup is probably fortuitous but, in the case of the two painters, seems calculated,; Mr. Devlin's theme being the suburban idyll, Mr. Birmelin's the urban nightmare.</p>
        <p>It must be Mr. Devlin's year, for he has not only this retrospective but also, at the Zimmerli Art Museum, a sizable show of children's book illustrations, most of them joint efforts with his wife, Wenda. The Morristown production, in which Mrs. Devlin makes a guest appearance with a portrait or two, fills the museum's glistening new wing to capacity, since Mr. Devlin has been focusing on Victorian architecture in all its eclectic glory for more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>In the styles of Queen Anne, Italianate, the Egyptian, Greek, Gothic and Renaissance Revivals, his buildings are made of stone, brick and wood, some stuccoed and shingled, others "gingerbreaded." They stand, for the most part, in sunshine; the vegetation knows its place (note the pink blossoms shyly edging into "Queen Anne Spring"), the flag is often displayed and nothing is out of place save for the paper lying in the long grass outside the house in "High Street Italianate."</p>
        <p>If, at a great distance, Mr. Devlin seems like Edward Hopper, happy, it is because he looks back in nostalgia at houses that were facts of daily life for his predecessor. Still, this was not always so. During the 1960's, the New Jersey artist (born, raised and a resident) was evidently aware of the 17th-century Dutch masters, for then he described his subjects with more painterly care and bathed them in softer light. His 1966 "Octagon House" is the best example of this, but there are many rivals of the same vintage.</p>
        <p>Around the end of the 70's, however, the color begins to get flat and bright, the technique mechanical and the compositions unduly photographic. The influence of Photo-Realism may be to blame, but the success that was beginning to rain down on the artist -- medals, awards, chairmanships, induction into the New Jersey Advertising Hall of Fame -- may also have been a factor.</p>
        <p>It's not that the paintings are untrue but rather that the world in them has in effect been preserved in aspic -- the kind used to heighten history in places like Boston's waterfront and the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. To the extent that he faithfully records the past as it now stands Mr. Devlin can be -- and has been -- applauded. Nevertheless, his mature work makes at least one of his viewers itch to start a society for the preservation of historical grime.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Devlin omits, Mr. Birmelin includes, with a vengeance. He does not identify his mise en scene but, from the garbage on the streets and the paranoia in the air, it has to be Manhattan, specifically the Manhattan that exists in the tabloids and in the minds of its visitors.</p>
        <p>In these crowded pictures men and women lurch, unseeing and unthinking; disembodied hands reach out to clutch; bodies fade in and out, jostling and eclipsing each other -- all at high speed; and the traffic is terrible.  Some of the pedestrians keep their money in hand. In "Exchange," one exchanges his for dubious goods; a man forages in a trash container, and, in a black crayon drawing, a limousine lurks at night, so does a lady of the evening.</p>
        <p>A Weegee in paint and crayon, Mr. Birmelin comes at the scene from photojournalist angles and without much interest in the appearance and character of the players. He works rapidly and streakily in reds, browns, yellows and an occasional loud green or blue. As well as Mr. Devlin's images, these are half-truths passing for whole truths.</p>
        <p>Displayed inside the museum and out, Mr. van Alstine's sculptures are the same or similar to those that appeared in his 1990 solo at the Nohra Haihme Gallery in Manhattan. The artist, a recipient of several awards and fellowships, practices his own form of Surrealism by combining unlikely shapes and materials. Plates and curving rods made of smooth steel or bronze intersect with slabs of granite and slate that seemingly have "faulted" of their own accord from their matrixes. Actually, the juxtapositions are carefully calculated and the stone, so farfrom having materialized, is rigorously carved. "Ara," a tetrahedron levered up on one side by a bronze cylinder, supports on its pinnacle a bronze anvil with a ball on it. The rock stands more than six feet tall, but, in a Magritteish way, it seems lighter than the anvil. In other works, the artist treats his materials as if they were masonry fragments and their armatures retrieved from demolished buildings. Cool and elegant sculptures, accompanied by pastoral drawings, they remain on view through Feb. 24, likewise Mr. Birmelin's paintings. Mr. Devlin's architecture stays through March 3.</p>
        <p>The museum is at 6 Normandy Heights Road. Hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday through Saturday and 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday.  ART</p>
