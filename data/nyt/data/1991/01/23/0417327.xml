        <p>Earnings increased to almost $1.24 billion, from $1.17 billion in the last quarter of 1989. And its revenues rose to $17.2 billion from $16.2 billion.</p>

        <p>The General Electric Company said yesterday that its net income and revenues both rose by 6 percent in the last three months of 1990.</p>
        <p>Earnings increased to almost $1.24 billion, from $1.17 billion in the last quarter of 1989. And its revenues rose to $17.2 billion from $16.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Although G.E. did not discuss the fourth-quarter performance of any of its businesses, which include the NBC Broadcasting group, as well as the investment firm Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, the conglomerate indicated that the gain represented a continuation of trends evident throughout much of last year.</p>
        <p>Strong growth at businesses like aircraft engines and power equipment that operate with long lead times continued to compensate for declines in other groups, notably plastics and the NBC Broadcasting group. Report Due Next Month</p>
        <p>G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., releases more detailed information on the performance of its businesses with its annual report at the end of next month.</p>
        <p>The company's earnings per share for the quarter rose faster than net income -- by 9.2 percent, to $1.42, from $1.30 last year -- because General Electric bought 41.7 million of its common shares since November 1989, as part of a five-year, $10 billion buyback program.</p>
        <p>G.E. took a $100 million charge against its earnings in the quarter to pay for a previously announced restructuring, which included some layoffs, to improve margins in several critical businesses, including aerospace, aircraft engines and appliances. The charge was largely balanced in the quarterly figures, the company said, by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Ladd Petroleum unit to Amax Inc. for $515 million plus working capital.</p>
        <p>"It was a reasonably solid quarter, considering what's going on in the economy," said Robert W. McCoy Jr., who follows the company for UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.</p>
        <p>General Electric said its net income for 1990 rose by 9.4 percent, to $4.30 billion, from $3.93 billion in 1989, while its earnings per share rose by 11.2 percent, to $4.85 from $4.36. Its revenues totaled $58.4 billion, up by nearly 7 percent from $54.6 billion in 1989.</p>
        <p>John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive, said companywide productivity improvements played a leading role in helping G.E. overcome the pressure on earnings from rising oil prices, the sluggish domestic economy and declining consumer confidence.</p>
        <p>GE Financial Services was also a major contributor to earnings, reporting a 15 percent gain from the 1989 quarter, excluding GE Americom, a satellite carrier that was transferred to the Financial Services operation from Technical Products and Services. The GE Capital Corporation, which accounts for most of the financial group, recorded strong gains despite troubles in its investments in leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate. Data Lacking on Units</p>
        <p>Financial services also includes the company's insurance unit, ERC, and the 80 percent stake in Kidder, Peabody, but General Electric declined to discuss the performance of either subsidiary, both of which are operating in troubled industries.</p>
        <p>The company said that overall operating margins reached 11.6 percent in 1990, a company record. General Electric's shares fell 75 cents each yesterday, to $56.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
