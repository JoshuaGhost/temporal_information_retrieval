        <p>Working overtime when most other people were taking time off, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, appeared to solidify another fifth of the team's starting rotation yesterday. He didn't say so, but Michael's words indicated that the Yankees had reached agreement on a new contract with Mike Witt, their new-look free agent.</p>
        <p>"We won't do anything today; it's too hard getting in touch with everybody," Michael said. "We think we're coming close."</p>

        <p>Working overtime when most other people were taking time off, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, appeared to solidify another fifth of the team's starting rotation yesterday. He didn't say so, but Michael's words indicated that the Yankees had reached agreement on a new contract with Mike Witt, their new-look free agent.</p>
        <p>"We won't do anything today; it's too hard getting in touch with everybody," Michael said. "We think we're coming close."</p>
        <p>How close? "Pretty close. We're just not going to do anything today. We'll do it tomorrow if we're going to do anything."</p>
        <p>Michael's comments were similar to those he made last Sunday in discussing the status of the Yankees' effort to acquire Scott Sanderson. They announced the agreement Monday, but they actually had agreed on a two-year, $4.5 million contract Sunday and held the announcement for 24 hours. 3-Year Pact Likely</p>
        <p>It seems very likely that they are operating the same way in the case of Witt, putting off until today an announcement that they have signed him to a three-year contract worth more than $6 million.</p>
        <p>"You don't want to lose your own if you can avoid it," Michael said.</p>
        <p>Adding to the likelihood that an agreement has been reached, a lawyer not directly involved in the negotiations said that the Yankees and Nick Lampros, Witt's agent, had reached the stage where they were discussing guarantee language.</p>
        <p>Lampros said last night that he thought an announcement today was possible. "There are some things that need to be done before a deal can be completed," he said by telephone from his home in California. "We should be able to accomplish them."</p>
        <p>After Sanderson accepted the Yankees' offer Sunday, he telephoned Witt and encouraged him to re-sign with the Yankees. "If I'm going be part of this team, I want to make it as good as I can, and having Mike would mean having a better pitching staff," Sanderson said.</p>
        <p>Witt, whom the Yankees obtained from the California Angels last May 11 for Dave Winfield, was one of 15 players -- free agents following the 1987 season -- who were granted free agency last month as part of the collusion settlement between the owners and the players.</p>
        <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have also been trying to sign the 30-year-old right-hander. They have more to offer as far as being a stronger team, but they have talked of using Witt the way they used John Cerutti the past few years -- as a starter if they needed him as a starter, otherwise as a reliever.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, on the other hand, urgently need Witt for their shaky starting rotation, and he clearly prefers the starting role. He was happy to leave the Angels because they had demoted him to the bullpen after using him only as a starter the previous six seasons.</p>
        <p>In 10 relief appearances before the trade, Witt had a 0-3 record, one save, a 1.77 earned run average and a two-inning share of a no-hitter. With the Yankees, he was strictly a starter, compiling a 5-6 record and a 4.47 e.r.a in 16 games. He missed two months with a sore elbow.</p>
