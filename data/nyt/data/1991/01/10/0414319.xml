        <p>As one might expect, Bill Blass designed a red, black and white houndstooth suit. Pat Kerr whipped up an ivory lace and tulle wedding dress, replete with a fake white dove.</p>
        <p>These slipcovers, posing as clothes, are among the 25 created by fashion designers for the Fourticq Chair Dress Show, which opens Wednesday at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ranging from opulently romantic to sleekly tailored, most of the slipcovers mirror the designers' clothes.</p>
        <p>The idea for this show -- merging fashion with furnishings -- was born a year ago in Houston. Gregory Fourticq, the owner of a home furnishings store there, had noticed that fashion and interior design often follow identical paths. "A few years ago," he said, "we saw Christian Lacroix's clothing, which had swags, silk flowers and feathers, and in interior design a return to more opulence, more swags, tassels, fringe, velvet and gilded pieces."</p>
        <p>In June, he invited 35 designers to make slipcovers for a folding chair, and 25 accepted. The show opened in Houston in November; F.I.T. is the second stop, under the sponsorship of Elle Decor magazine.</p>
        <p>Most of the designs have extravagant details, like flowers, tassels and bows. Zandra Rhodes said, "I used all the essentials I'd use on a dress: my pleated rosettes, which are like the edges of my jackets; my old green satin with my signature on it." The green satin seat is edged with pleated rosettes in ruby, purple and red. Murray Arbeid's peach silk chiffon slipcover is, he said, "over the top." The chiffon is covered with silver glitter and trimmed with peach ostrich feathers and silver tassels.</p>
        <p>For his spring collection for Anne Klein, Louis Dell'Olio designed clothes with color blocks: sleeves in one color, the bodice in another. His slipcover echoes this design; the seat is white, and the back and sides are draped in red and magenta. A black swag holds round gold buttons.</p>
        <p>The show runs through Feb. 9 at F.I.T.'s Shirley Goodman Resource Center, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street in Manhattan. Hours are 9 A.M. to 8 P.M. Monday through Friday and 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday. Admission is free.</p>
