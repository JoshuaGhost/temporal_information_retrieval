        <p>In the archeology of discarded foreign influence here, Soviet artifacts now sit atop the multilayered trash heap of history. But the fascination with America, if it ever disappeared, is re-emerging.</p>
        <p>Jean Nguyen Khac Doan is one of this still-sophisticated city's best gauges of fashion, selling and recycling the detritus of foreigners. A northern-born Roman Catholic who speaks excellent French, he moved to the south in 1951. He was a teacher, then served in the South Vietnamese Army as a political officer, learning a working English. Russian, he says, he never took the time to learn.</p>
        <p>In some ways, it didn't matter. The Russians, military and civilian advisers both, never had very much to sell or barter. But what they did have, especially caviar and the suddenly modish wristwatches of Soviet officers, are among Mr. Doan's best-selling items.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doan's shop -- just off Dong Khoi, the old Tu Do in the American time, and Rue Catinat for the French -- is a way to see the movement of history, or at least its flotsam.</p>
        <p>At a quick glance, it is a sort of junk shop: lots of clocks and watches, silver and crystal, old pens and cameras and books in many languages, Buddhas and Khmer heads (almost assuredly fake), a few of Vietnam's inescapable porcelain elephants and an ever-ready pot of tea. A Sort of Order</p>
        <p>But there is a sort of order. What the Russians are now leaving behind has pushed back on the shelves what the Americans left, as much of what the French left before them is relegated to a back room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doan's wife, Madeleine Huynh Thi Thuan, works with him and their two remaining children. A daughter died of an asthma attack, in part because of inadequate medical care; their eldest son disappeared at sea in 1982, after fleeing by boat to seek resettlement in the West.</p>
        <p>"Every family in the south of Vietnam has been touched, has one or two who have died at sea, who have disappeared or were in jail," Mr. Doan said. Now 53 years old, he spent two years and two months in a re-education camp after 1975 and tried numerous times himself to escape by boat. "But each time I was betrayed," he said. "Finally I had only enough money to send my son."</p>
        <p>The hard hand of the Communist Government has loosened considerably here since the first few years after South Vietnam fell, he says. Private enterprise is encouraged. Crackdowns are intermittent, of course, particularly after the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. But mostly, the police now leave people like Mr. Doan alone.</p>
        <p>He caters both to Vietnamese, with treasures to sell or money to buy, and to foreigners looking for an unusual memory or souvenir. Sometimes, he says, they are seeking to repurchase the past. Some Popular Clocks</p>
        <p>An American veteran comes in, looking for the night-vision binoculars he remembers. He nearly buys a French officer's saber for $70. A German journalist examines an old Rolleiflex camera. A French banker arrives to pick up a heavy, round, 24-hour clock the Americans used on their patrol boats. Repaired by Mr. Doan and his staff and often mounted in wooden boxes, they are very popular, as are the smaller ones pulled out of American helicopters.</p>
        <p>Most of these key-wound ship's clocks were made by the Chelsea Clock Company of Boston. After oiling and adjustment, they keep on ticking. Mr. Doan sells them for $100 to $200. The brass ones are the most expensive. "I discovered this market a year ago," Mr. Doan said, and he has since sold more than 50 clocks.</p>
        <p>"People like them, especially French tourists," Mr. Doan said. "They like things from the American army. Many ask me to find them leather flight jackets." Swedes, he says, like United States Navy binoculars. "The Swedes think they are all sailors and navigators."</p>
        <p>Old Swiss watches, especially Rolexes, are very popular, too, but more scarce. Fakes are proliferating, Mr. Doan says, with some of the best now made in China and Vietnam. Many of the Rolexes for sale -- about $400 for steel, $700 for steel and gold and about $2,000 for solid gold -- never belonged to Americans at all, he says, but to Vietnamese who had Americans buy them at the P.X. and who now need the money.</p>
        <p>Ah, but Soviet watches -- "these are one of the best things to sell," Mr. Doan said. "They're not beautiful, and they're heavy, but they are good watches and cheap, with many decorations. And they are the fashion now in Europe." Caviar Sells Well</p>
        <p>Soviet army officers' watches are particularly prized, bearing a star. Naval officers' watches have a blue face and an anchor. Tank officers' watches display a tank. "Americans like these a lot," said Mr. Doan, who has sold more than 300 of them at prices ranging from $5 to $30. "They make good Christmas presents."</p>
        <p>Russian caviar, too, sells well, but with fewer Soviet advisers here the price has doubled in a year. A 95-gram tin of pasteurized Beluga is now $15, while a 600-gram tin is $80, but hard to find. At the moment, there is a 1.5 kilo (3.3 pound) tin of fresh caviar for $120. Most of the stock now originates with Aeroflot pilots.</p>
        <p>"Just watches and caviar," Mr. Doan says. "There's nothing else Russian that people want."</p>
        <p>Outside, the archeological process continues. On the streets, the Soviet Volgas and Ladas are being replaced by Toyotas and Nissans. A few Peugeot 404's and ancient Citroen sedans, last seen in French gangster movies, still putter along, as do the incongruous bulks of much-repaired Ford Fairlanes, Chevy trucks, DeSoto buses and International Harvester jeeps.</p>
        <p>Japanese autos are part of the inevitable transition from isolationism toward hard currency, however much they choke on bad Soviet gasoline. But there is something of a resurgence of American influence, too, which is more a matter of stylishness, itself a quiet political gesture.</p>
        <p>It is not just that so many young people are learning English. The Cuu Long Hotel is now, once again, the Majestic. For a week, the Continental Hotel, its famous open-air bar now glassed in, had a freshly painted American jeep out front. Near the airport is a stunningly modern discotheque called Superstar. And then, almost inevitably, there is the newly opened Ca-li-pho-nia Ham-bu-go restaurant.</p>
