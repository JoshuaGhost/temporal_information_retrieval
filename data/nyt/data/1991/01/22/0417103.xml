        <p>A seven-member delegation that came to China from foreign countries to express concern about political prisoners had its own run-in with the law today, as the police detained the seven and ordered them to leave the country within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The seven delegates, including members from the United States, Canada, Britain and the Netherlands, were released this evening after being detained for nearly five hours. A CBS News cameraman, who was on the scene and whose television camera and film were forcibly confiscated, was toldto return on Tuesday to inquire about recovering the camera.</p>
        <p>The police went to the delegates' hotel this afternoon and took them to the police station. There they were told that they were engaging in activities incompatible with their visa status as tourists. After several hours, they were released and told to leave China by 6 P.M. on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The delegation had come to China to try to observe and express concern about the fairness of a series of trials that are under way for university students and intellectuals involved in the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement. The trials are officially described as open, but admission is by ticket only and court officials refuse to give out the tickets.</p>
        <p>Only nine people have been sentenced so far in this round of trials -- to terms ranging from suspended sentences to four years in prison -- but the best-known and most prominent dissidents have yet to be sentenced. Longer terms are expected for them.</p>
        <p>As they stood on the chilly street tonight, after being released, members of the delegation said the expulsion order did not affect their plans, as they were already scheduled to fly out of China on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The delegates had arrived in Beijingon Thursday and had gone from ministry to ministry to inquire about the political prisoners and urge that they be treated fairly. In most cases they were allowed to meet with low-ranking officials and make their views known.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to say that people around the world are concerned about the trials," said Simon L. Jones, who was representing a British group called the Chinese Political Prisoners Campaign. Mr. Jones said that the officials generally gave few answers to their questions, but that one cadre in the Justice Ministry said that Wei Jingsheng, an essayist and advocate of democracy who has been in prison nearly 12 years, was alive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wei, who is serving a 15-year prison term, is rumored to be suffering from mental problems, partly because he is reported to be kept in solitary confinement and not allowed to talk even to the guards. Mr. Wei's teeth are believed to have fallen out as well, from gum disease or poor diet.</p>
        <p>"Our treatment today seems very strange, because we've been received elsewhere in the Government, and we felt that we had opened some kind of a dialogue about the prisoners," Mr. Jones added.</p>
        <p>A Chinese studying in Canada also tried to return to Beijing to express concern about the trials, but was turned back at the airport on Saturday and put on the first plane out of China. And last month, a Chinese studying in Texas returned to Beijing to try to help a friend who is facing trial, but he had to go back to the United States without seeing his friend or meeting any senior officials.</p>
