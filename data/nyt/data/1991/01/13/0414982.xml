        <p>DICKENS By Peter Ackroyd. Illustrated. 1,195 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $35.</p>
        <p>This new biography of Dickens waddles along like a maudlin elephant that has attached itself to us against our will. When it speaks, it is liable to say things like this: "There are certain people who seem doomed to buy certain houses. The house expects them. It waits for them." Or this: "Can we not say that Dickens captured the soul of the English people . . .?" Or this: "Familial love can find an echo in our own hearts just as it did in that of Charles Dickens." All in all, maybe not the voice we were hoping for, even if we were hoping for another life of Dickens.</p>
        <p>Peter Ackroyd is a novelist and biographer of considerable talent, but why he turned that talent in this direction is not clear. Of course, the Dickens story is a great one -- the driven, uproarious genius caught in a psychic drama of misery and injustice he is also enjoying and exploiting -- but we have heard the story before, several dozen times over the years and even within the last decade. To make matters more peculiar, Mr. Ackroyd's is not exactly a Dickens for the 90's, at least not the 1990's. Mr. Ackroyd lumbers along with no concern at all for 20th-century modes of understanding the self: post-structuralist suspicions have made no inroads, and even Freud causes no alarm. Instead, he works in the old style and with the old tools, recalling the boozy-familiar tone of G. K. Chesterton at the turn of the century and the sturdy unsubtlety of John Forster, Dickens's first biographer. As they say in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," "Let's do the time warp again!"</p>
        <p>Sane people do not attend "Rocky Horror" or seek out time warps, and there would be little reason to tolerate this biography if it were no more than peculiar. But, though it is maddening in its smugness, arises from a field of vision almost preposterously narrow, seems relentlessly self-absorbed and is couched in prose that often slithers and simpers, the book still finds a way to insinuate its importance. It does so, I think, not because it is itself peculiar but because it is so open to the peculiarity of its subject. Mr. Ackroyd's "Dickens" demands our attention precisely (and only) because it is so open to the strange.</p>
        <p>On one level, this openness manifests itself in Mr. Ackroyd's willingness to let his own uncertainty out of the bag, admitting that for all the research he has done -- and it is massive -- he cannot hope to domesticate his subject, cannot properly understand him. "One senses," he says, "the essential strangeness of the man," a strangeness that Mr. Ackroyd allows to take center stage: "He never realised how strange a writer he was." We find ourselves with such mysteries on our hands for several obvious reasons: Dickens was an unusually self-enclosed and secretive man; much is lost in the way of information; the intimate details that count are never recoverable. Mr. Ackroyd is open about that sort of thing, lamenting the fact that we cannot even guess at what has been so completely erased by time. Even when he has material with which to work, it is often dubious hearsay, gossip that he can only say "rings true" or "has an air of authenticity" about it. It's all a bit like Bram Stoker's "Dracula," where the story is constructed with the aid of "hardly one authentic document."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ackroyd's own evocation of the bizarre produces more than bats. By refusing to shoo away the strangeness in his subject or in his project, he provides for us a variety of possibilities for understanding that are engaging just because they remain uncontrolled, even unexplained. His treatment of Dickens's broken marriage is a fine example. There he can only point again and again to what he does not understand about its basis and its collapse, blocking easy explanations: "But matters are never . . . simple in any marriage, let alone that of Dickens." We are, of course, given a great deal of data, all that exist, one supposes. But still we do not</p>
        <p>know,</p>
        <p>and that not knowing, paradoxically, keeps us from closing off the issue with easy judgments. Similarly with Dickens's mother, whom Dickens has traditionally been supposed to despise: Mr. Ackroyd suggests, gently, that one might just as well construe the evidence we have into a portrait of one who cared deeply for her son and attended to him with affection, providing the boy (and man) a part in a complex drama where he could play out, with great and painful satisfaction for himself, a script of "guilt and rejection" combined with "a kind of hopeless love."</p>
        <p>Best of all, Mr. Ackroyd presents us with the oddest explanation yet of Dickens's strange and long alliance with the actress Ellen Ternan, suggesting that he idealized her as he did his wife's dead sister Mary Hogarth, brother-sister friendships and a whole host of saintly virgins in his fiction; and that it is therefore "almost inconceivable" that the two became sexually enwrapped. He means it has become far too easy to think in terms of adultery, the terms presenting themselves to our common sense and common experience. What we gain by allowing full oddity to Dickens, in this matter and in others, is the capacity not simply to refigure the Ellen Ternan affair but to reach outside our own secure common conclusions and find again a strange uncertainty. Mr. Ackroyd's great achievement is that he reinvests Dickens, that familiar figure of hearth and home, with an alien, slightly repellent mystery.</p>
        <p>And there are other rewards for undergoing the companionship of a book whose full complement of annoyances has not yet been hinted at. Mr. Ackroyd often tells anecdotes very well, and there are hundreds of these. He has a firm and complex view of Dickens's need not just for order but for mastery of everything about him, people and objects alike: he would even rearrange hotel furniture to conform to his view of the world and his control of it. Mr. Ackroyd is equally impressive in his analysis of Dickens's extraordinarily personalized view of public affairs. He shows us a man who was bitterly reactionary as regards penal policy but filled with terror and pity as soon as he could imagine himself in the place of the prisoner, who had interest in individual workers in whom he could see himself but none at all in the working class.</p>
        <p>He never sentimentalizes Dickens's views, bluntly calling him "a 'racist' of the most egregious kind" and noting that he possessed "a striking inability to see his conduct on anything other than his own terms," consistently seizing the wrong end of the stick and using it to belabor everyone in sight. Finest of all is Mr. Ackroyd's tactful portrayal of the way Dickens exploited and was trapped within an infantile drama of abandonment, an "imaginative orphanhood" that gave him a sense of being uncaused, inimitable, but also a horrible fear of being vulnerable, a sense that everyone was watching him, everyone was talking about him. In all of this, Mr. Ackroyd is smart, persuasive, even fun to be with.</p>
        <p>But there are times in this 1,195-page slog when he is a bore and a nag. Worst of all is that he won't go away, droning on for so long that the reader may start to root for death to come to Dickens just to get it over with. The length might be justified if we received some fine literary criticism, but what we get is lousy, on the order of how Dickens's affection for his monsters makes them "so vividly alive" or how he seldom writes about sex "for the simple reason that sex renders people all alike." Speak for yourself! At least Mr. Ackroyd speaks very little about the novels, saying he is sick of academic literary criticism and wants to write not a "life and work" but a life and times. What this really means is that, apart from three powerful and valuable pages on disease and sanitation in midcentury London, Mr. Ackroyd now and then allows to bloom sickly little sprigs of pseudohistorical weedy generalization -- "He embodied the period from which he sprang" -- or even startling hothouse inventions of his own: "Child molestation was not infrequent in the period." In other words, Mr. Ackroyd has no more to say as a social and intellectual historian than he does as critic.</p>
        <p>Given the brevity of Dickens's life, then -- he died at 58 -- Mr. Ackroyd is left with a dangerous amount of room in which to chat away. Into all this he pours a lot of invented nonsense -- giving us nine full lines, for instance, of a song Dickens may have sung as a child (though there is no evidence he did), simply because Mr. Ackroyd has unearthed it. One often gets the feeling he has resolved that none of his quite commendable work will have been in vain and that whatever he has on hand he will give to us. Readers will start to recognize the file cards spilling out of the pigeonholes every time we come to a new key term. Let St. Paul's Cathedral be mentioned and here we go for a paragraph on what characters said about it in novels; mention water and we get all of Dickens's reflections on it and the names of all his favorite rivers and seaside hotels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ackroyd also has space for lots of personal opinions, no matter how pointless or bubble-headed: he feels that fecklessness may be inherited (though it usually skips a generation); he thinks cities "do not change over the centuries"; he thinks William Morris and John Ruskin were "less complete men" than Dickens because they did not join him in celebrating the advance of technology. And Mr. Ackroyd loves to tell us things, the same things, several times, even (or especially) if they were not worth mentioning the first time: how many times need it be observed that many 19th-century illustrators were neurotic or that Dickens had "a real sense of the numinous"?</p>
        <p>Add to this that the work seems unsure of its audience, providing no footnotes or exact references, but concluding with a bizarre parade of bibliographical essays running to 59 pages; that it gives the date only about once every 100 pages (and then not always the right date -- Dickens left the law firm of Ellis &amp; Blackmore in 1828, not 1838) and leaves us feeling as if we were wandering purblind in some deep cave; that it contains six quite ghastly interludes featuring imaginary meetings of such figures as Mr. Micawber, Dickens, Peter Ackroyd, Little Nell, Oscar Wilde and T. S. Eliot -- complete with weird dialogues. I have left to censure only the book's style, a style meant, I suppose, to be "evocative," filled with atmosphere and flavor: "The want of something; the ache; the loneliness; the closeness to tears." That's a complete sentence, but there are equally poetic fragments too, along with several thousand rhetorical questions.</p>
        <p>One is haunted by the book and its images of oddity nevertheless. Whether the estranging is worth the price extracted from us is a question I cannot answer. But then I have no sense of the numinous at all.</p>
