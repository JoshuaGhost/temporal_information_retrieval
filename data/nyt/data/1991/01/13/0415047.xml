        <p>Dashing hopes for a drop in South America's highest rate of political violence, Peru's internal war has claimed 1,500 lives in the six months since Alberto Fujimori was inaugurated President.</p>
        <p>Overall, 3,384 people -- civilians, soldiers, policemen and Marxist guerrillas -- were reported killed in 1990, according to figures issued this week by a commission on violence of Peru's Senate. The toll represents a 10 percent increase over 1989.</p>
        <p>"I estimate that 25 to 40 percent of the national territory is now under the open or semi-clandestine control of the Shining Path," said Gustavo Gorriti, a Peruvian journalist. The Shining Path, a Maoist group, and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a rival, Castroite group, are Peru's main guerrilla organizations.</p>
        <p>"The change of government in Lima was completely irrelevant to the insurgent violence," said Mr. Gorriti, referring to the inauguration in July of Mr. Fujimori.  Campaign Vows Unrealized</p>
        <p>At the time, hopes were high for the start of a gradual pacification. An agronomist of Japanese descent, Mr. Fujimori received strong electoral support from Peru's rural Indian and mixed-race voters, a politically, racially and economically disenfranchised group that has provided the Shining Path with much of its support.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fujimori has been unable to translate into reality his campaign vows to fight guerrillas through rural development and a more professional army.</p>
        <p>Instead, Peru's violence has not skipped a beat. In Lima, guerrillas have carried out dynamite attacks against the embassies of Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States. A car bomb damaged a luxury shopping center four days before Christmas. In mid-November, guerrillas shot to death a prominent judge four blocks from a tourist hotel where President Fujimori was attending a banquet.  Lima Without Power 66 Days</p>
        <p>Attacks on electric power pylons left this city of seven million people without power for 66 days last year.</p>
        <p>In late November, a Shining Path guerrilla squad killed Javier Puiggros Planas, an agronomist who wrote a farm column in a leading Lima newspaper. In another rural incident in late November, Shining Path guerrillas killed a Japanese tourist, Wakamiya Makamori. A note left on the body said Mr. Makamori was killed "for being Japanese, like Fujimori."</p>
