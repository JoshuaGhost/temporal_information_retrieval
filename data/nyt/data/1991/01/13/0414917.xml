        <p>A GROWING interest in spicy food has led to the emergence of three Indian restaurants in Stamford alone. The latest to arrive is Gandhi, in Ridgeway Shopping Center space that was formerly occupied by Bonani (which has moved farther downtown, on Summer Street). Gandhi, a storefront restaurant has kept Bonani's Indian motifs and has created the illusion of spaciousness by using smaller tables.</p>
        <p>The menu will look comfortingly familiar to those who like Indian food; it has an ample assortment of lamb, beef, seafood, biryani rice and vegetarian dishes. One puzzling category, though, is "tandoori superb," featuring several tandoori dishes; the puzzle stems from the fact that the restaurant has no tandoor oven.</p>

        <p>A GROWING interest in spicy food has led to the emergence of three Indian restaurants in Stamford alone. The latest to arrive is Gandhi, in Ridgeway Shopping Center space that was formerly occupied by Bonani (which has moved farther downtown, on Summer Street). Gandhi, a storefront restaurant has kept Bonani's Indian motifs and has created the illusion of spaciousness by using smaller tables.</p>
        <p>The menu will look comfortingly familiar to those who like Indian food; it has an ample assortment of lamb, beef, seafood, biryani rice and vegetarian dishes. One puzzling category, though, is "tandoori superb," featuring several tandoori dishes; the puzzle stems from the fact that the restaurant has no tandoor oven.</p>
        <p>The appetizer list is small, but one of the better dishes was banana pakora, consisting of four large puffs of banana fritters in a crispy batter. The fritters were enhanced by dipping in tamarind sauce, a tart and sour condiment, the best of several served gratis. Also pleasant as a starter was the chef's special appetizer: pieces of chicken breast marinated in spices and cooked in a sauce of green peppers, onions and tomato cream and served with a single large vegetable samosa (a deep-fried patty) and a spicy, paper-thin, brittle lentil wafer called pappadum.</p>
        <p>Probably the best way for a novice to experience a variety of Indian starters is to order the assorted hors d'oeuvres -- which includes a samosa, several pakoras, two kebabs (spicy ground-meat patties) and a pappadum. One order serves two people nicely. Assorted vegetable pakora gave a sampling of deep-fried fritters, filled with vegetables (cauliflower, potato and peas), but several were darkly overcooked.</p>
        <p>Entrees of note included chicken shahi kurma, pieces of white meat of chicken cooked in a gently seasoned cream sauce. Along with a generous platter of fluffy rice, it made a satisfying and moderately priced dinner. All entrees are served with rice, dal (a traditional lentil dish in Indian meals, usually eaten with the rice) and assorted condiments. The dal at Gandhi was unusually thin and watery.</p>
        <p>Another appealing entree was lamb vindaloo, one of the most incendiary items on any Indian menu. At Gandhi it was medium-hot, but with abundant chunks of lamb. It is also available with chicken, beef, shrimp, crabmeat or lobster. Less satisfying was shrimp shag, a mixture of spinach and small shrimp that was curiously lacking in flavor. Normally, Indian chefs have such a way with spinach that those who have not liked the vegetable quickly become fans. A vegetarian entree, pallok paneer, proved the point. It was an aromatic, delicious mixture of freshly cooked spinach and cubes of white cheese.</p>
        <p>Certain other vegetarian entrees were disappointing, none more so than vegetarian thali.  Normally it is a dish presented with some elan -- several vegetables offered individually on a round tray, with raita (cucumber yogurt) and condiments. At Gandhi, the thali consisted of three small sauce dishes filled with indifferent renderings of mottor paneer (cheese and peas in a mild sauce), alu mottor gobi (potatoes, peas and cauliflower in a bland sauce), and a third, undistinguished mixed vegetable dish. With the thali came a puffy poori (deep-fried bread inflated like a pint-size volleyball) and a pappadum. At $12.95 this was a rare example of overpricing. One of Gandhi's better breads was keema paratha, stuffed with chopped meat and peas, which tasted freshly made.</p>
        <p>Desserts are usually unnecessary at an Indian restaurant, but Gandhi offers a sampling of two. One, firni, was delicious, a delicate custard creation with sultanas in it. The other was gulab jamen, round cheese balls soaked in sugar syrup, but served too cold, a poor rendering of this Indian favorite. A cup of tea (spiced with cardamom) made a fine finale.</p>
        <p>In a land of the blands, an Indian restaurant like Gandhi might be king, but unfortunately for the amicable, well-intentioned place, the competition in Stamford is tough, with Gandhi the least successful.</p>
        <p>A three-course meal for two cost $34.40, with tax, tip and drinks extra. Wine and beer are the alcoholic options; an imported Indian beer, Golden Eagle, made a flavorful accompaniment. A non-alcoholic alternative might be a refreshing glass of mango lassi (a yogurt-based classic).  Gandhi</p>
