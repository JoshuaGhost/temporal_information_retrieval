        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Much more important events have been on all of our minds in the last 10 days, but I am commenting now on "America's Duty to New York; Fighting for Fairness: I" (editorial, Jan. 6).</p>
        <p>You suggest that Congress should spread the burden of your needy residents among suburbanites and Midwest farmers. I am a Midwesterner and do live on a farm, but am not a real farmer. Your conclusion may indeed be correct. What is "wrong" is the clear image that Midwesterners, agribusiness people and otherwise, have of the New York milieu.</p>
        <p>The day after your editorial appeared a lead article in The Wall Street Journal cited a young investment banker who made $23 million last year; a few days later there was mention of another who made $20 million. The obscene incomes of the Boesky-Milken era may be behind us, but the image sticks.</p>
        <p>I know of no Iowa farmers who make incomes anything like that and doubt if there are more than a handful with seven-figure incomes. When they were suffering from the malaise of the early 80's (and drought in the late 80's) they did not seek -- or expect -- New Yorkers to come to their rescue.</p>
        <p>There is a different mind-set out here; different values pervade the landscape. Your editorial writers -- as well as your politicians -- would do well to spend some time with people for whom $20 million incomes are the stuff of "Bonfire" and "Wall Street." You may be right, but you have a long way to go to convince people in rural Dubuque, Durham and Duncan to help. RICHARD KOLCK Dubuque, Iowa, Jan. 15, 1991</p>
