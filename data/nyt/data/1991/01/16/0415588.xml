        <p>As the United Nations deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait expired, taking with it virtually all hope for peace in the Persian Gulf, the people of this desert kingdom and the fighting men and women who have journeyed so far to defend them seem to share a single thought, a single fear: how terrible will war be?</p>
        <p>"In our minds, the war has started," said Clint Esarey, 32 years old, an Army captain from Indianapolis who spent much of Tuesday dictating his will on a cassette tape and drafting a note for his wife saying he would understand if she chose to remarry.

        <p>As the United Nations deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait expired, taking with it virtually all hope for peace in the Persian Gulf, the people of this desert kingdom and the fighting men and women who have journeyed so far to defend them seem to share a single thought, a single fear: how terrible will war be?</p>
        <p>"In our minds, the war has started," said Clint Esarey, 32 years old, an Army captain from Indianapolis who spent much of Tuesday dictating his will on a cassette tape and drafting a note for his wife saying he would understand if she chose to remarry. The tape included instructions for his burial.</p>
        <p>"If I don't make it back, I want to be buried in my military uniform," Captain Esarey said. "I'm a soldier. It's my life. The uniform is part of me."  Mood Is Called Somber</p>
        <p>On what may be the eve of war in the Persian Gulf, he described the mood of troops under his command as somber: "They're mulling this stuff around in their minds."</p>
        <p>As of midnight Eastern Standard Time -- 8 A.M. today here in the vast deserts of Saudi Arabia -- American-led forces in the gulf were authorized under a United Nations resolution to go to war to force Iraq out of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>In the hours before the deadline, an anxious quiet settled over the deserts of northeastern Saudi Arabia, the region that would be most vulnerable to Iraqi attack.</p>
        <p>The tension among American-led troops and their Saudi hosts could certainly not be disguised as they went about the final preparations for war, but there was no panic in the places it might have been expected.  'A Hint of Chaos'</p>
        <p>"We thought there would be trouble, maybe a hint of chaos," said a Saudi official who has been involved in civil defense planning. "God has granted us a calm before battle. Many of the people most worried about a war are already gone."</p>
        <p>In recent days and weeks, thousands of Saudi families packed up their belongings and left the area closest to Kuwait, many heading to the relative safety of the western Saudi coast near the city of Jidda, along the Red Sea.</p>
        <p>The streets of Dhahran, the large eastern oil-industry city that is within the range of Iraqi Scud missiles, were quiet Tuesday afternoon and, in some neighborhoods, largely empty.</p>
        <p>Although shops and gas stations in Dhahran were open, others were shuttered. At some shops, hand-lettered signs in Arabic taped to the window announced they would be closed "until further notice."  Lines for Gas Masks</p>
        <p>In desert cities near the Kuwait border, tens of thousands of Saudis and expatriate workers lined up patiently at civil defense offices Tuesday afternoon to buy government-issued gas masks.</p>
        <p>The Soviet-made rubber masks will, they voiced hope, keep them safe from attack by the chemical and biological weapons that Iraq has threatened to unleash.</p>
        <p>The Government is loaning out the masks for a fee of 100 Saudi rials, about $29, each. They are supposed to be returned to the Saudi Civil Defense Directorate when the crisis ends.</p>
        <p>"We think this area is very safe," said Abdulrahman Abulhassan, who was waiting in line in Al Khobar, a city along the Persian Gulf about 180 miles from Kuwait, within the range of Iraqi missiles. "There are American weapons everywhere to protect us."</p>
        <p>Mr. Abulhassan, a Saudi businessman, wanted 15 gas masks for employees of his car dealership. The day before, he said, he rented masks for his wife, his four children, his housekeeper, his driver and himself.  'I Think They Will Be Safe'</p>
        <p>"My employees were nervous, but I calmed them down," he said. "I think they will be safe. I want these masks to be certain that they are safe."</p>
        <p>Romeo Tarraya, a 42-year-old Filipino warehouseman at Dhahran's international airport, had been in line for a mask for about an hour, and he appeared almost serene as he discussed the threat of chemical warfare.</p>
        <p>"As a Christian I don't think I have anything to be afraid of," he said. "I am here because my company told me to be here to get a mask."</p>
        <p>Ziaul Hasan, 29, an accountant from Hyderabad, India, said he had delayed getting a gas mask, hoping that the crisis would somehow end without war. "Until now, I had thought there would be peace," he said.  Crowds Jam Airport</p>
        <p>There was no panic late Tuesday night even among the crowds that jammed into the Dhahran airport, seeking any flight out of the city.</p>
        <p>Several of the Saudi national airline's jumbo jets sat on the tarmac, waiting to ferry thousands of passengers on hastily scheduled flights to Riyadh or Jidda, cities considered safe from Iraqi attack, at least for now.</p>
        <p>Many of the passengers in the check-in lines were tearful women and children being sent from danger by their husbands and fathers or brothers. Several of the fleeing passengers appeared to have stuffed their life's belongings into suitcases ready to burst.</p>
        <p>"I've never seen so many people at this airport," said Berthold Schimmer, a 39-year-old Bavarian who works in Dhahran for Mercedes-Benz, the German auto maker.  'It Is Not Safe Here'</p>
        <p>He looked about nervously as he waited in a long check-in line, explaining that the other passengers in line "know it is not safe here."</p>
        <p>Mr. Schimmer had come to the airport to see off his wife, Regina, 33, who was booked on a flight to Jidda, and then on to Ghana, where she expects to stay with relatives until the war, or the threat of war, has passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schimmer clutched his wife's ticket as if it held the power of life or death.</p>
        <p>"She wanted to stay, but I'm forcing her to go," he explained, saying he had made the decision to send his wife out of the country after peace talks between the United States and Iraq collapsed last week in Geneva.</p>
        <p>"It's so sad," said Mrs. Schimmer, her eyes fixed on her husband's anxiety-ridden face. "It's really unfair for me to leave him. But I think there will be war. And there is no safety."</p>
