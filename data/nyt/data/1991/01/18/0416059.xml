        <p>Steel industry executives said the war in the Middle East would not affect their business prospects in the near term.</p>
        <p>"Very little of what we produce goes into war materials," said Robert Lefley, a spokesman with Inland Steel Industries. "The biggest impact will be what it does to the overall economy and consumer confidence, which will enable consumers to buy durable goods."</p>

        <p>Steel industry executives said the war in the Middle East would not affect their business prospects in the near term.</p>
        <p>"Very little of what we produce goes into war materials," said Robert Lefley, a spokesman with Inland Steel Industries. "The biggest impact will be what it does to the overall economy and consumer confidence, which will enable consumers to buy durable goods."</p>
        <p>Other steel executives and analysts said a disruption in crude oil supplies, or higher prices, would have a damaging effect in the long term. Energy costs for steelmakers and other manufacturers have climbed by as much as 50 percent since the Persian Gulf crisis began last summer.</p>
        <p>"When the problem is resolved and tension eases, we can expect investment in plant and equipment to accelerate and the industrial expansion phase of the business cycle to continue," said Frank W. Luersson, chairman and chief executive of Inland Steel and chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group.</p>
        <p>A long war would be disastrous for the steel industry, analysts said, because interest rates and inflation would likely remain high.</p>
        <p>"The steel industry needs lower interest rates to help stimulate capital spending," said Christopher Plummer, a steel industry analyst with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., a research concern. "The construction industry and capital spending in manufacturing accounts for 60 percent of the demand for steel."</p>
