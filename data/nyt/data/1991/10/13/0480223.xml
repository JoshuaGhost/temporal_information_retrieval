        <p>A big-city mayor is secretly filmed in a hotel room snorting cocaine with a woman who is not his wife. Another mayor, grasping at the last spoils before his political machine collapses, is guilty of complicity in the death by arson of two squatters whose makeshift home stood in the way of a lucrative land deal.</p>
        <p>Given the seemingly boundless greed and venality that periodically mar American politics, art faces stiff competition trying to imitate, much less outdo, life. The cocaine incident really happened. The corrupt land deal is the crux of "City of Hope," the John Sayles film that opened Friday.</p>
        <p>"City of Hope" weaves together disparate plots, glossing over some and depicting others perhaps too simplistically. But measured against reality as defined by today's headlines, the film is strikingly accurate in its portrayal of events and, more significantly, of the personal motivations that inspire them.</p>
        <p>The film explores some troubling truths. Those truths are personified by Nick (Vincent Spano), the son of a well-connected contractor (Tony Lo Bianco) who fights to escape the political system that enriched his father. (That same political system can rationalize murder to advance its agenda.)</p>
        <p>Another totemic figure is Wynn (Joe Morton), a black city councilman who resists the mayor's entreaties to get along by going along, forges a tenuous alliance with black militants and wrestles to reconcile conscience and ambition as he fights his way</p>
        <p>into</p>
        <p>the system. The wavering needle of Wynn's moral compass veers further when two black teen-agers mug a white professor, touching off a chain of events that evokes the Tawana Brawley hoax.</p>
        <p>"City of Hope," which Mr. Sayles wrote, directed and edited and in which he plays Carl, a nefarious fixer, echoes a theme of lost innocence that reverberates through his previous films, including "Matewan" and "Eight Men Out." In the latest one, Mr. Sayles has produced a bleak portrait of ethnic succession in a generic "changing city" in New Jersey where, he says, "the population has changed, but the politics hasn't." The film pits the remnants of an Irish and Italian political machine against a coalition of black and Hispanic political novices. The newcomers are struggling to find their voice and, having found it, to force the city's white establishment to listen.</p>
        <p>Events surrounding the proposed land deal, immodestly dubbed Galaxy Towers, provide the nexus at which raw greed, organized crime, grass-roots community advocacy, power, passion and racial tension intersect. Mayor Baci (Louis Zorich) of Mr. Sayles's fictional Hudson City hasn't gone to jail only because he hasn't got caught.</p>
        <p>Some of the film's sleazebags may seem too bad to be true. But Mr. Sayles says that his political friends disagree: "The only things they didn't believe," he says, "were the positive things."</p>
        <p>Like the director's previous films, "City of Hope" stretches members of a community to their limits as they confront almost as many mini-crises as punctuate an Arthur Hailey novel. And like politics itself, the movie is largely about compromises rather than profiles in courage.</p>
        <p>In many ways, "City of Hope" is a gritty composite of "Goodfellas" and "The Last Hurrah," the 1958 film about Boston politics directed by John Ford. Interspersed are dozens of characters who connect in an incestuous web: Joe, the successful contractor being squeezed by the mayor and the mob; Joe's foundering son Nick and Nick's pals, Bobby and Zip; Asteroid, the homeless man who mindlessly mouths slogans from television commercials; Levonne and Malik, the local black community organizers.</p>
        <p>These individuals are as vivid as the Congressmen who were conned by Federal agents posing as Arab sheiks and as unabashed as the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been accused of exploiting racial incidents for political purposes.</p>
        <p>Despite its title, moments of moral enlightenment are in short supply in a film whose characters would feel at home in most city halls. "You don't put in</p>
        <p>time</p>
        <p>, Gus," an official chides a goof-off city inspector. "How can you put in</p>
        <p>over</p>
        <p>time?"</p>
        <p>When the councilman seeks a menial job for his brother-in-law from an influential businessman, the merchant replies, Godfather-like: "You're my representative on the council -- someday I got a matter that needs representing -- quid pro quo."</p>
        <p>Two women meander through "City of Hope" periodically whining about a school system that teaches English as a</p>
        <p>second</p>
        <p>language and about the police being handcuffed. They reflect Mr. Sayles's concern about eroding confidence in government and the declining political support for America's cities.</p>
        <p>Before settling part-time in historically corrupt Hudson County, Mr. Sayles lived up the Hudson River in Albany, where the county Democratic machine, led for decades by Dan O'Connell, had the grace to install a patrician, Erastus Corning 2d, as Mayor. Mayor Baci, however, was modeled more on Mr. O'Connell and colorful Jersey City Mayors like the legendary Frank Hague or the incumbent, Gerald McCann.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sayles was conducting a reality check on his screenplay last year by scanning the political blotter in The Jersey Journal and the now-defunct Hudson Dispatch, confirmation came quickly: a mayor went to jail; the son of another politician was charged with drunken driving; a construction union boss was indicted; a rally was called to protest police brutality. "Every day," Mr. Sayles recalls, "there were headlines right out of the movie." (Mr. McCann, the Mayor of Jersey City, where Mr. Sayles monitored council meetings as part of his research, was not indicted until after the film was completed -- for mail, wire and bank fraud in connection with a hotel and marina project.)</p>
        <p>In "The Last Hurrah," Frank Skeffington, the fictional anti-hero played by Spencer Tracy, acknowledged his shortcomings only in a deathbed confession when a loyal ward boss whispered: "You've done grand things. Grand, grand things." To which Skeffington replied: "Among others."</p>
        <p>Mayor Baci evokes no such ambivalence. Nor does he demonstrate any self-doubt. Surveying the spoils within his grasp, he confides to Joe: "We take care of our own. That's natural. The next couple years in this town is gonna be one big yard sale, and then anybody with half a brain makes tracks and lets the blacks and Spanish duke it out over whatever's left." Then it will be their turn.</p>
        <p>"Ninety years ago, the Irish ran this town," he says reflectively. "Now I run the place. America, huh?"</p>
        <p>One consequence of indiscretions by party bosses of the past is that standards and scrutiny by the media and by government monitors have become more rigorous. The film ignores the media's sometimes erratic performance as public watchdogs, which is related to the public's even more erratic appetite for government reporting. (A credo of local television news: "If it bleeds, it leads.")</p>
        <p>The film touches on another manifestation of media influence: a local black newspaper's political agenda. Also, in one revealing reminder that no group can claim ethical superiority, Errol, the retired black mayor, concedes that he had covered up corruption in the final days of his own administration "because we'd lose more ground by cleaning house in public than by sweeping it under the carpet."</p>
        <p>The overarching theme of "City of Hope" is less the last fling of the old party machine than the ethical questions posed by the lurching birth of a new one: when does compromise become the first step on an inexorable path to corruption? The white liberal who deserts Wynn and a Hispanic councilwoman to oppose the school bond issue whispers a convenient rationalization: "So we'll lose 7-to-2 instead of 6-to-3 like we always do."</p>
        <p>Wynn insistently tells Errol that "if we're going to take power we have to take responsibility, too." Wynn's most profound moral quandary is prompted by the reflexive exploitation of a mugging. When Wynn's wife asks whether he believes that the white victim provoked the attack with a homosexual overture, as the muggers claim, Wynn replies: "Politically speaking, that doesn't really matter."</p>
        <p>Caught amid conscience and ambition, Wynn grapples with the kind of ethical dilemma that real-life politicians are forced to confront. Between a rationalization and a lame excuse lies a political mine field that cynics can navigate by invoking a largely insincere defense: if the ends don't justify the means, what does?</p>
        <p>"A true believer can be just as dangerous as a total cynic," Mr. Sayles says. "Cynical would have been Wynn knowing what happened and supporting the boys anyway. Heroic would be saying, 'I don't believe it and no way I can pursue it.' He finds a third way to harness that energy."</p>
        <p>At the film's surreal finale, Nick, the contractor's troubled son, "hasn't turned into Mario Cuomo," Mr. Sayles says, "but he at least realizes the negatives of the old way of you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours." While Nick and a few others inspire a modicum of hope, Mayor Baci provides the irony. He is the only protagonist to actually speak the title phrase -- "With your help, we will once more be a city with a future, a city on the move, truly, a city of hope," he proclaims, as angry advocates for the poor burst uninvited into a banquet hall, in a confrontation more realistic than the one recounted in "The Bonfire of the Vanities."</p>
        <p>The film is open-ended, Mr. Sayles says, precisely because in politics, "not only don't you ever start from scratch, you never win." Rather, politics is a continuum consisting of one struggle after another.</p>
        <p>"City of Hope" was filmed through a wide-angle lens, which gives viewers an advantage over political reporters: the camera suggests the comings and goings of the protagonists, sometimes before even they realize that they are falling or rising as a result of their ambitions.</p>
        <p>"Heroism in movies is generally not about compromise," Mr. Sayles says. Heroism in politics, rarer still, is often about knowing when to compromise and when not to.  FILM</p>
