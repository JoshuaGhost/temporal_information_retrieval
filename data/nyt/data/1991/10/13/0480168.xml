        <p>For the Pirates, it is no idle figure of speech. It is the literal truth. Their prayer has been reduced to a man called Whisper.</p>
        <p>The Pirates, whose character pitcher was sidelined with an injury in Game 1 and whose statistical ace was exiled today because of ineffectiveness, will have to send Randy Tomlin, a.k.a. Whisper, to the mound for Game 4 of the National League playoff against the Braves Sunday night at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.</p>
        <p>A loss of composure by Tomlin will likely mean the Pirates will be poised for disaster, a single defeat removed from elimination.</p>
        <p>"I've heard for too long how the pressure is on Andy Van Slyke, Bobby Bonilla and Barry Bonds, because if ever there was a time for pressure to be pointed at a pitching staff, it is now," said Andy Van Slyke, the center fielder for the Pirates, whose 10-3 loss to the Braves today left them trailing in the playoff, two games to one. "We can't come to Atlanta and put up an earned run average of over seven and expect to win. We just ain't that good."</p>
        <p>Today, John Smiley was plenty bad. The left-hander, who went 20-8 for the Pirates during the regular season, lasted all of two innings against the Braves. The war drums in the stands hadn't even found their rhythm before Smiley utterly lost his on the mound, hatcheted into the ruins of bad mechanics, bad pitches and a 5-1 deficit before the game was a third done.</p>
        <p>"I don't like talking about it, but I let the team down," said Smiley, who couldn't keep many of his pitches down against the Braves. "I wish I could have kept us in it. Instead, I took us out of it."</p>
        <p>Chiefly because of a first inning he couldn't escape. After a pair of harmless outs, the Braves smacked three straight doubles off Smiley for a 2-1 lead before Greg Olson cranked a two-run blast to left. A 1-0 lead had crumbled to a 4-1 deficit, and the Pirates never climbed out of the rubble. In his career, Smiley is 1-4 with an earned run average of 6.76 in Atlanta. And the Pirates are 0-7 in Atlanta in 1991.</p>
        <p>"We didn't look like a good club today," said Manager Jim Leyland. "Smiley wasn't sharp, and we never held them once. Can't let people put two and three runs up on the board an inning against you. We're going to have to get with it."</p>
        <p>But get with it with what? Doug Drabek, whose injured left hamstring might be repaired enough to allow him to pitch in Game 5, is still only a hope. And their prayer for competence on the mound and thus a shot in the game for Sunday is Tomlin, the starter who was ordered to the bullpen before the start of the series. The left-hander with the strange delivery and underused vocal cords was 8-7 this season, with four of his eight triumphs coming against the Mets. He has never appeared in post-season play, and pitched only two innings against the Braves in 1991.</p>
        <p>Whisper better keep a lot more than himself silent, starting with the right-handed bats of Ron Gant, Terry Pendleton, Greg Olson and Brian Hunter.</p>
        <p>"I think it will work to my advantage," Tomlin said of his lack of a track record against the Braves. "But I haven't faced them much, either."</p>
        <p>Will Drabek ever face the Braves again? That is the most urgent question in the Pirates' clubhouse after whether Tomlin will hold up in the face of the Atlanta bats and the stadium's tomahawks. Drabek threw in the outfield today before the game, but not off the mound. The team's trainer said that Drabek still felt the problem in his hamstring, but that the right-hander who was so masterful against the Braves in the 5-1 victory in Game 1 no longer suffered pain.</p>
        <p>"Monday is what we're shooting for," said Drabek. "That's the target."</p>
        <p>If he misses, Leyland could have to go with the random firing of right-hander Bob Walk or left-hander Zane Smith on short rest.</p>
        <p>"We'll wait and see what happens," said Leyland.</p>
        <p>Smiley couldn't bear watching what happened today, unable to stomach his own failure and then left with the distasteful assignment of watching Bill Landrum give up a run-scoring single to the harmless Rafael Belliard, Bob Kipper yield a bases-empty homer to Gant and Rosario Rodriguez be victimized for Sid Bream's three-run monster shot in the eighth.</p>
        <p>"Do I feel a sense of deja vu?" Smiley said when asked about having lost to the Reds last season in the playoffs after taking Game 1. "I don't think so. I don't like to think so."</p>
        <p>With a two-games-to-one deficit, a 10-3 loss in a game begun by their 20-triumph left-hander, the prospect that the season's most important game in the hands of its least seasoned pitcher, there wasn't much the Pirates liked to think about tonight.</p>
