        <p>IN OLDER and remodeled houses, ceiling lights above staircases or in rooms with two doors are sometimes controlled by just one wall switch. That means having to negotiate a dark stairway or walk through a dark room to turn on the light.</p>
        <p>The problem can be solved by adding a second switch at the head or foot of the stairs or at the entrance to the second doorway, and by making each switch a three-way switch.</p>
        <p>Before starting, find out from your Building Inspector whether electrical work by amateurs is permitted and what code regulations apply. Also plan the easiest route for the new cable from the existing switch to the new one.</p>
        <p>On a ground floor, cable can often be led through the floor by drilling a hole in the base of the wall and routing the cable across the basement ceiling, where by drilling another hole it can be fed upward to the new switch.  Up and Across the Attic Floor</p>
        <p>On a top floor, the cable can be led up to and across the attic floor and then fed down to the desired location. When adding a switch near a staircase or in a room on a middle floor, cable can be routed behind baseboard or other molding.</p>
        <p>Begin by cutting an opening in the wall for the new switch box. Plastic and metal switch boxes are available, but this writer assumes that a metal box is being installed.</p>
        <p>The box should be at the same height as the others in the house. The usual procedure is to trace the outline of the box on the wall and cut along the outline with a drywall saw, a short, pointed handsaw with coarse teeth. Pry a knockout from the box to admit the cable and install the box with screws or bendable metal side brackets.</p>
        <p>Feed the cable into the box and direct it along the planned route toward the existing switch. Cable for lighting switches should be 14 gauge. For three-way switches, it must have three conductor wires -- black, white and red -- plus a ground wire, which is usually bare copper.</p>
        <p>Where necessary, cut access holes in the walls to bend cable around corners or to thread it through holes drilled in framing pieces. To route cable most easily, draw it between outlet boxes and access holes with electrician's fish tape, springy steel ribbon that can be rented.</p>
        <p>Before taking the new cable to the existing switch box, shut off the electricity to the switch by tripping the breaker or removing the fuse for the circuit. Unscrew the wall plate covering the switch and touch the wires with the probes of a circuit tester to make sure the power is off. A circuit tester is a small bulb attached to two wires.</p>
        <p>After making sure the power is off, unscrew the switch from the box and free the wires attached to it by clipping off their ends. Pry out a knockout in the box and draw the end of the new cable into it.</p>
        <p>Clip the new wires so that each is about four inches long, and strip about three-quarters of an inch of insulation from all the wires, new and existing.</p>
        <p>Buy two three-way switches and a supply of wire nuts. To connect the first switch in place of the existing one, examine the wiring in the switch box carefully.</p>
        <p>If two existing cables enter the box, one cable from the power source and the other leading to the light fixture, use a wire nut to connect the black wire in the cable from the source to the black wire in the new cable. Also connect the white wire in the new cable to a light-colored terminal screw on the new switch.</p>
        <p>Next connect the black wire in the cable leading to the light fixture to the dark-colored terminal on the switch and connect the red wire in the new cable to the remaining light-colored terminal.</p>
        <p>Connect the ground wire in the new cable to the other ground wires in the box or, if there are none, to the box itself.</p>
        <p>The white wire in the cable from the power source and that in the cable to the light should be already connected with a wire nut.</p>
        <p>To connect the second switch, attach the black wire in the cable to the switch's dark-colored terminal. After attaching the white wire to a light-colored terminal and the red wire to the other terminal, fasten the ground wire in the new cable to the box.</p>
        <p>To show that the white wires attached to both switches carry current from the power source, paint their ends black or wrap them with black electrician's tape.</p>
        <p>If only one cable is in the box, indicating that power flows first to the light fixture and then to the existing switch, connect the black wire in the existing cable to the dark-colored terminal of the new switch.</p>
        <p>Paint or tape the end of the white wire in the existing cable black and attach it with a wire nut to the black wire in the new cable.</p>
        <p>Paint or tape the white wire in the new cable black and fasten it to a light-colored terminal on the new switch. Next attach the red wire in the new cable to the second light-colored terminal.</p>
        <p>Join the ground wire from each cable with a short length of copper wire attached to the box and connect all three wires with a wire nut.</p>
        <p>To connect the second switch, attach the black wire in the cable to the switch's dark-colored terminal. Paint or tape the end of the white wire black and attach it to a light-colored terminal. Attach the red wire to the remaining light-colored terminal and fasten the ground wire in the cable to the box.</p>
        <p>Push the switches carefully into the wall boxes and secure them with screws. Restore the power and test your work. Then reattach the wall plates and patch the walls.  HOME CLINIC</p>
