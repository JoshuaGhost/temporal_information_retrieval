        <p>After agreeing in the spring to end 16 years of civil war, the Angolan Government and the main rebel movement have brought their rivalries to this country, with both sides soliciting support from the United States Government, the American business community and the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Jonas Savimbi, the United States-backed guerrilla leader of the civil war against the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Angolan Government, accused the Government in Luanda of seeking to delay a national election and has asked for American and U.N. support to insure a "free and fair" vote in September 1992.</p>
        <p>In a weeklong visit scheduled to end this weekend, he also presented his plan for the structural rehabilitation of the devastated Angolan economy and urged foreign investment there.</p>
        <p>Declaring that the cease-fire in Angola was holding up, except for "minor problems," Mr. Savimbi said on Thursday that contrary to a pledge to President Bush last month, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had recently hinted to European leaders that elections planned for September might be switched to October or November or delayed 36 months. Mr. Savimbi added that Mr. dos Santos told the National Assembly in the Angolan capital, Luanda, this week that the date of elections was not important, and that what mattered was a stable economy.</p>
        <p>Frank Da Cruz, spokesman for the Angolan mission to the United Nations, said that President dos Santos plans to announce a date for elections on Nov. 11, Angola's national day, which marks 16 years of independence from Portugal. He said he believed that the date would be sometime between September and November 1992, as stipulated in the peace agreement.</p>
        <p>In meetings with Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders last month, President dos Santos pledged that Angola's commitment to democracy and a free-market economy was "irreversible" and asked for help with the electoral process. He met with American business leaders to discuss trade and other economic matters, according to the Angolan Mission to the United Nations. 'Firm Commitment' to Peace</p>
        <p>In talks with both Angolan leaders, Mr. Bush repeated his "firm commitment" to the peace process outlined in the peace accords signed in May, the White House said. After a meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Savimbi this week, the White House noted that Mr. Bush repeated that he would prefer September elections.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with more than 100 American businessmen and bankers, held by the U.S.-Angola Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Mr. dos Santos detailed changes in the Angolan economy and encouraged American investments in his country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savimbi, in his meetings in Washington and with the Business Council for International Understanding in New York, questioned the Angolan Government's commitment to reform. He accused Mr. dos Santos of trying "to lure American capital" to improve his party's image and warned that without outside pressure, elections might not be held before 1993.</p>
        <p>Calling for U.N. and American observers to be involved in the electoral process, and not only in the last two months of campaigning, Mr. Savimbi accused the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola of endangering the election with acts of intimidation, denying freedom of movement and limiting access to news media.</p>
        <p>A highlight of Mr. Savimbi's visit was a meeting on Thursday with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. Mr. Savimbi said he thanked the Security General for humanitarian aid to Angola and asked for his commitment to the peace process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savimbi expressed confidence that his organization, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, generally known by its Portuguese acronym Unita, could win a free and fair election because it was seen as "resisting Communist domination." Trying to deflect long-standing criticism for accepting military aid from South Africa, he said the aid was necessary because of the heavy Cuban support of the current Angolan Government.</p>
