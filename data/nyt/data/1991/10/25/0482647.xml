        <p>Saying that First Amendment guarantees outweighed the right to privacy, a Florida judge ruled here today that the state had no right to bring criminal charges against a weekly supermarket tabloid that published the name of the woman who has accused William K. Smith of raping her.</p>
        <p>The decision came as prosecutors and lawyers for Mr. Smith, a 31-year-old nephew of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, began their final round of pretrial hearings in the rape case. Mr. Smith, accused of raping a 30-year-old Florida woman at the Kennedy family's Palm Beach estate in March, is scheduled to go on trial here on Dec. 2, but selection of a six-member jury is scheduled to start Oct. 30.</p>

        <p>Saying that First Amendment guarantees outweighed the right to privacy, a Florida judge ruled here today that the state had no right to bring criminal charges against a weekly supermarket tabloid that published the name of the woman who has accused William K. Smith of raping her.</p>
        <p>The decision came as prosecutors and lawyers for Mr. Smith, a 31-year-old nephew of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, began their final round of pretrial hearings in the rape case. Mr. Smith, accused of raping a 30-year-old Florida woman at the Kennedy family's Palm Beach estate in March, is scheduled to go on trial here on Dec. 2, but selection of a six-member jury is scheduled to start Oct. 30.</p>
        <p>County Judge Robert V. Parker dismissed all charges against The Globe, the tabloid newspaper that had been accused of violating a Florida law that prohibits publication of the names of victims of sex crimes. Although several newspapers, magazines and television networks in the United States and abroad, including The New York Times, have published the name of Mr. Smith's accuser, The Globe was prosecuted because it is published in Florida. Concerns Called 'Overblown'</p>
        <p>Judge Parker ruled that the 1911 statute under which The Globe was charged is both "unconstitutional on its face and as applied" in the Smith case. "However desirable shield laws may be, the enforcement of such laws collides with First Amendment claims of the press to comment freely on a matter of public interest," he wrote in a 21-page opinion.</p>
        <p>"The state's expressed concerns about a victim's safety and privacy are somewhat exaggerated and overblown," Judge Parker continued. He said that Mr. Smith's accuser "was not in any real, potential danger and surely she must have realized that charges would be filed and that she would have to testify in public."</p>
        <p>In fact, Judge Parker said, the alleged victim's identity was "a matter of public record" and was widely known to both the press and the public before The Globe published her name.</p>
        <p>Florida is one of four states that prohibit publication of the names of victims of sex crimes; the others are Georgia, South Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for David H. Bludwsorth, the state attorney who is the chief prosecutor in the case, said an appeal of Judge Parker's ruling would be filed.</p>
        <p>In a related development, the circuit court judge presiding over the Smith case ruled today that some parts of upcoming hearings involving three women who say Mr. Smith sexually assaulted them in separate incidents in the 1980's will not be held in public. That procedure is warranted, said the judge, Mary Lupo, by provisions of Florida's rape shield law and the need to limit pretrial publicity.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Smith also argued today that the charges against their client be dismissed. In a motion filed nearly five months ago, they cited prosecutorial misconduct and publicity encouraged by the state as factors that made it impossible for Mr. Smith to receive a fair trial.</p>
