        <p>Stepping up their pressure for a freeze on New York City property taxes, major real estate groups charged yesterday that any further increases would not only be a bad idea but would violate a ceiling set by the State Constitution. They have also filed a lawsuit seeking to block any increases.</p>
        <p>City officials promptly dismissed the claim as overblown. They said the city could raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars without hitting the constitutional ceiling set in 1953, though they acknowledged the city will approach the limit in coming years.</p>

        <p>Stepping up their pressure for a freeze on New York City property taxes, major real estate groups charged yesterday that any further increases would not only be a bad idea but would violate a ceiling set by the State Constitution. They have also filed a lawsuit seeking to block any increases.</p>
        <p>City officials promptly dismissed the claim as overblown. They said the city could raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars without hitting the constitutional ceiling set in 1953, though they acknowledged the city will approach the limit in coming years.</p>
        <p>In any event, the suit by the Real Estate Board of New York, the Rent Stabilization Association and other landlord groups added new firepower to an anti-tax campaign that is shaping up as a major element of the fight over how to balance the city's budget over the next three years. It has already used a flood of postcards to city officials, a re-enactment of the Boston Tea Party and newspaper ads urging New Yorkers, "Don't take a hike, say no to higher taxes."</p>
        <p>Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Finance Commissioner, said: "This is a political lawsuit, brought by a coalition for lower taxes, but clearly not by a coalition for credible lawsuits, because it has no merit."</p>
        <p>Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board, acknowledged the suit is "a pressure tactic."</p>
        <p>The suit argues that the city is using unrealistic estimates of real estate values, prepared by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, to calculate how much it can levy in taxes. Under the State Constitution, the annual yield from the property tax cannot exceed 2.5 percent of the average value of all taxable property in the city for that and the preceding four years. Warning to the City</p>
        <p>But a survey has not been done since 1986, when property values were rising, and the current estimates are based on annual growth projections developed in the boom years of the 80's that purport to show that values have more than doubled since 1986. In fact, the suit contends, values have declined so much in that time that the city is deriving the cap from an artificially inflated base, and property taxes may even be exceeding that ceiling.</p>
        <p>"We believe we're at that cap, or close now," Mr. Spinola said at a news conference on the steps of City Hall to announce the suit against the city and the state board filed in State Supreme Court in Albany.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Cleireacain acknowledged that property values had declined, but said the city had to await the results of a new state survey due next month, and that in any event, values had not declined as much as the suit alleges.</p>
        <p>Joseph Pierson, a spokesman for the assessment board, said calculating the rolling five-year averages required appraising many properties and that in the meantime the board had to rely on the statistical projections. "Their argument is they're not as current as they should be," he said. "Given our limits, they're as current as they can be."</p>
        <p>In its August report, the State Financial Control Board, a watchdog group, warned that current estimates of the city's real estate values were artificially high. It said the city risked using up its leeway by 1996 if it went ahead with plans for $500 million in annual property tax increases in the coming years.</p>
        <p>But Mayor David N. Dinkins has said he intends to hold increases far below those earlier plans, and he has left open the possibility of a freeze.</p>
