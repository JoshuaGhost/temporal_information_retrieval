        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Afghanistan, Still Bleeding" (editorial, Sept. 17) correctly states that despite the agreement ending military shipments to Afghanistan, the potential for continued bloody conflict there is still great. While Washington and Moscow have agreed to end their proxy war, the Afghan people need assurances from us that credible leadership can now come forward.</p>
        <p>The dogmatic adherence during the 1980's by Moscow to the Brezhnev Doctrine and by Washington to containment theory prompted both to support fringe elements of the Afghan political spectrum. Neither the leadership in Kabul -- kept in power for years by Soviet troops, tanks and billions in scarce hard currency -- nor the resistance nurtured in Peshawar by Pakistan with United States financing and acquiescence has credibility with the Afghan people. They cannot lead the country out of this bloody civil war.</p>
        <p>The announcement by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Boris D. Pankin, supporting "negative symmetry" (front page, Sept. 14) may portend that Washington and Moscow now wish to walk away from the bloody morass and leave the cleanup to the United Nations. Without continued high-level United States and Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, our Afghan proxies (each with more than a two-year supply of weapons) will continue to fight. You advocate the United Nations cease-fire and transitional government plan being pushed by the Secretary General's special envoy Benon Sevan as the best hope for peace. That may be, if credible leadership that speaks for the Afghan people can emerge.</p>
        <p>At the outset of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan, then under the rule of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, allowed only seven of some 40 Afghan political "parties" to use Pakistan as a base for military and political operations. They received all military aid. They grew in military power, but have thus far failed to win the trust of the Afghan people. Many Afghans believe that an Afghanistan under the seven resistance parties would be little better than that under the butchers of Kabul. The seven parties are in the best interests of Islamabad, but not of Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>United States support of the United Nations effort for intra-Afghan dialogue must stipulate that dialogue include more than those Afghans who have grown fat through years of feasting on the spoils of United States and Soviet assistance. There are Afghan personalities who, if provided superpower assurances of protection from assassination and intimidation, could lead the Afghan people. Washington and Moscow can best avert continued bloodshed by making it clear to our respective clients that room in the dialogue must be made for personalities who command the respect of the majority of the Afghan people. JOHN BALBACH  Palo Alto, Calif., Sept. 23, 1991 The writer was staff director of the Congressional Task Force on Afghanistan.</p>
