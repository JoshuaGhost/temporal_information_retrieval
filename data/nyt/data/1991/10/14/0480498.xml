        <p>Traditionally considered a healer, time is proving a scourge to a distressing number of the Kennedys of Massachusetts. As monumental tragedy continues to collide with shabby scandal, once shining Camelot looks more and more like dingy old Peyton Place.</p>
        <p>The Kennedys are returning to prime time this week in still another mini-series putting them under a microscope searching for truth, presumably, and entertainment values. The new vehicle, running for six hours over three consecutive nights through tomorrow, is "A Woman Named Jackie," on NBC. That woman is, of course, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, who over time has gradually emerged from the Kennedy "myth" as probably the most astute and certainly one of the more dignified of the Camelot survivors.</p>
        <p>The Kennedy images have gone through stunning transformations in television dramas. In 1973, "The Missiles of October" gave us John F. Kennedy and his "best and brightest" staff as idealized heroes facing down threats from Russian and Cuban bullies. The dominant Kennedy image was hardly dented by such fawning treatments as 1977's "Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye" or 1981's "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy." Americans took eagerly to a magical world of princes and princesses, all the more so for the tragic aura that seemed to haunt them. By 1990, "The Kennedys of Massachusetts" was somewhat gingerly suggesting that there were signs of trouble in paradise.</p>
        <p>"A Woman Named Jackie," adapted from a 1989 best seller by C. David Heymann, wastes no time in alleging that reality was considerably less shimmering than many Americans realized. Jackie, played quite convincingly and impressively by a young Irish actress named Roma Downey, is the unquestioned centerpiece, but her portrait sticks fairly close to already established facts. Here is the poor little rich girl with prim and pushy mother and a drinking, carousing daddy whom she adores. Later, married to John F. Kennedy and confronted with her own marriage problems, Jackie will tell a friend: "You forget. I grew up with one of the greatest philanderers of all time, and I know exactly how it's done."</p>
        <p>This Jackie is hardly a candidate for canonization. She's ambitious and can be a pretentious snob (after her husband's assassination, she calls President and Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson "Colonel Cornpone and his Li'l Pork Chop"). She spends money with alarming insouciance. And at least as far as the Roger O. Hirson script is concerned, she is irritatingly narcissistic, given to breathy musings like "Who am I and what am I doing with my life that's worth a damn?" And she is depicted as being coldly calculating in her subsequent marriage to Aristotle Onassis, one of the world's richest tycoons.</p>
        <p>For Onassis, the widowed Jackie is seen as "the most desirable woman in the world" precisely because of her internationally renowned stature in the Kennedy story. But this television version of that tragic story is considerably less starry eyed than usual. As in some recent investigative books, the figure of John F. Kennedy is hardly noble or even admirable. Played this time by Stephen Collins, Kennedy is a calculating father-driven politician, an irresistible charmer and an obsessive womanizer.</p>
        <p>The Kennedys in general are depicted as relentless schemers, consumed with maintaining vote-grabbing images. Joseph Sr. (Josef Sommer), the family patriarch, bluntly tells his future daughter-in-law that "we are a family of winners and we marry winners." Actually this Jackie admires the old man, telling him, after a crippling stroke, that "we understand each other, we're both tough guys." Rose Kennedy (Rosemary Murphy) is a rather peripheral character here, wondering if Jackie isn't "too refined" to give birth.</p>
        <p>John Kennedy's extramarital dalliances are not examined in detail. No Mafia mistresses or Washington socialites here. But Marilyn Monroe (Eve Gordon) is used -- and that's the apt word -- to convey the point tellingly. Kennedy is depicted as dining with her publicly on the eve of the 1960 convention, amused when she giggles to his friends that "I always make his back feel better." Later the actress will phone the President at the White House and hear an angry Jackie on the other end of the line.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the affair is ended by the F.B.I.'s legendary snooper J. Edgar Hoover, who, according to Robert Kennedy (Tim Ransom), has "hours and hours" of tapes starring the President and the actress. John sends Bobby to tell Marilyn that it's all over, warning his younger brother that "she can be very hard to resist" and that he should be careful. Bobby, somewhat sheepishly: "I know." John, knowingly: "I had a feeling you did." The scene ends with the President saying: "Let's talk about something less complicated. What are we going to do about Castro?" The actress commits suicide soon after. Tawdry days are here again.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is nothing more than that the excessive burnishing of images inevitably invites, indeed demands, tarnishing, occasionally by the principals themselves. In any event, the process is saddening, at the very least. Few sights are more painful these days than that of Edward M. Kennedy, currently enmeshed in a Florida date-rape case involving his nephew, sitting uneasily through the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings looking into sexual harassment. The dimming of Camelot's promise is just about complete.</p>
