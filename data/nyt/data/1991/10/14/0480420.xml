        <p>In the first large demonstration in Manhattan by mainstream Jewish groups since the racial disturbances in Crown Heights last summer, about 5,000 people attended a rally in Madison Square Park yesterday to protest anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>But a small group of extremist demonstrators, yelling through bullhorns to make themselves heard over the crowd, tried to shout down speakers at the rally, asking, "Where were you during Crown Heights?"</p>
        <p>The protesters, followers of Kahane Chai, a group founded by the son of the slain Zionist leader Meir Kahane, were referring to the evenhanded approach that many mainstream Jewish groups took after angry blacks chanted "Heil Hitler!" in the Crown Heights disturbances in August. A Day-by-Day Rundown</p>
        <p>On the platform in the park north of 23d Street yesterday, the president of the Jewish Community Relations Council, Kenneth J. Bialkin, looked up from his notes as the heckling continued. "If the loudmouths will shut up for one second," he said, "let me tell you where we were in Crown Heights."</p>
        <p>Then he gave a day-by-day rundown of the statements and appearances he had made during the disturbances in the Brooklyn neighborhood. He concluded by saying, "Don't tell me we weren't there." He also called the Kahane Chai group "hooligans" and "loudmouths."</p>
        <p>"We are here because we heard cries of 'Heil Hitler!' and 'Kill the Jews!' on the streets of New York," Mr. Bialkin said.</p>
        <p>In the first few days after a black child, Gavin Cato, was killed by a Hasidic driver in Crown Heights and a Hasidic student, Yankel Rosenbaum, was killed in apparent retaliation, many Jewish organizations deplored the violence but stopped short of accusing the black protesters of anti-Semitism. Since then, Jewish organizations have criticized the racial violence as a dangerous manifestation of anti-Semitism and not just a byproduct of local Hasidic-black tensions. 'Instigated by Outsiders'</p>
        <p>Yesterday some of the speakers accused those involved in the Crown Heights disturbances of deliberate acts of hate against Jews. "What happened in Crown Heights was not an isolated incident," said Rabbi Shmuel Butman, a spokesman for the Lubavitcher sect. "It was part of a planned pogrom that was instigated by outsiders. When we Hasidim are attacked, we represent all of you: every single Jew."</p>
        <p>The "outsiders," he said, were "preachers without pulpits and lawyers without clients."</p>
        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins did not attend the rally or a march up Park Avenue South earlier in the day. But City Hall issued a statement in which he condemned anti-Semitism and urged state lawmakers to pass legislation setting penalties for hate crimes.</p>
        <p>"As the Mayor of the city with the largest Jewish population of any city in the world," the Dinkins statement said, "my voice will continue to be heard and I will continue to do everything necessary to insure that our Jewish residents and all New Yorkers can lead happy and productive lives free of crime and incidents of hatred."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bialkin, on the platform yesterday, was surrounded by more than 20 politicians, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican, and one of Mr. D'Amato's Democratic challengers in the 1992 Senate campaign, Attorney General Robert Abrams. Also at the rally were Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former United States Attorney in Manhattan; Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President; Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker; Elizabeth Holtzman, the City Comptroller, and Representative Bill Green.</p>
        <p>Former Mayor Edward I. Koch called for New Yorkers to denounce the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum with the same fervor that they denounced the killing of Yusuf K. Hawkins, a black youth shot by a group of whites in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, two years ago.  'A Collective Responsibility'</p>
        <p>Dennis Walcott, the president of the New York Urban League, told the crowd that "race baiting and Jewish bashing" had become commonplace, both in the nation and in New York City. "We have a collective responsibility to change that situation," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott appealed for improved relations between black and Jews. "There will be many occasions where we will have our differences, our disagreements and our arguments," he said. "But at the same time, there will be many times when we agree, and we cannot allow the negative to dictate our relationship."</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the rally, Mr. Bialkin successfully prevailed upon the Kahane Chai members for silence so the cantor could sing for Mr. Rosenbaum. "We are mourning our dead, you bunch of louts," he said.</p>
