        <p>Last month New York State's Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, delivered a roundhouse punch: a state lawsuit demanding that the Governor and Legislature provide more money for the courts. On Monday, Gov. Mario Cuomo came back with a sharp uppercut: a Federal suit challenging Judge Wachtler on constitutional grounds.</p>
        <p>Confronted with state officials behaving like schoolyard gladiators, U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein advised them to work with a distinguished mediator, Cyrus Vance. That's sound advice, but it doesn't require a Federal judge to point out what should be obvious to both Governor Cuomo and Judge Wachtler. This dispute simply doesn't belong in court.</p>

        <p>Last month New York State's Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, delivered a roundhouse punch: a state lawsuit demanding that the Governor and Legislature provide more money for the courts. On Monday, Gov. Mario Cuomo came back with a sharp uppercut: a Federal suit challenging Judge Wachtler on constitutional grounds.</p>
        <p>Confronted with state officials behaving like schoolyard gladiators, U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein advised them to work with a distinguished mediator, Cyrus Vance. That's sound advice, but it doesn't require a Federal judge to point out what should be obvious to both Governor Cuomo and Judge Wachtler. This dispute simply doesn't belong in court.</p>
        <p>Judge Wachtler's suit asserted that the Governor and the State Legislature, facing a budget crisis, had neglected a duty to provide enough money for court operations. Mr. Cuomo argues in his suit that citizens have a constitutional right to have taxing and spending decisions controlled by elected officials. The Chief Judge, Governor Cuomo asserts, improperly seeks that power for the judicial branch.</p>
        <p>However interesting those arguments may be, the dispute remains more political than legal. It ought to be resolved, as Judge Weinstein asserted, "through discussion, negotiation and compromise," rather than by "an unseemly conflict" in court.</p>
        <p>There is, furthermore, still some room for negotiation on the issue of court funding. Judge Wachtler says $23 million of cuts imposed on the courts in the spring forced crippling layoffs and court closures. Those cuts were finally approved in hasty budget talks; perhaps the Governor and Legislature went too far.</p>
        <p>And if, as the Governor argues with some reason, there now is no money to give back, why not devise some self-funding mechanism, like assessing a small percentage of damage awards to pay for court administration?</p>
        <p>While Judge Weinstein designated a magistrate to hear pretrial matters, he added his hope that "no further steps will need to be taken" in the courts. He urged that in talks with Mr. Vance, a former Secretary of State and a respected lawyer, Governor Cuomo and Judge Wachtler could find a way to settle their differences.</p>
        <p>There is real danger, Judge Weinstein noted, that "the litigation will take on a momentum of its own, exacerbating differences, distracting the parties from their work on behalf of the public, and creating new grievances." The Governor and the Chief Judge, in other words, already have enough more important work to do -- a point they should be the first to understand.</p>
