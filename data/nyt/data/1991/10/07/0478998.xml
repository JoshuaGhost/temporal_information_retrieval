        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Contrary to Dr. Irving Bieber's "important finding," as Dr. Myron Glucksman alleges (letter, Sept. 19), the claim that "homosexuals who wish to change their sexual orientation can through psychoanalytic treatment" has no scientific merit.</p>
        <p>While certain therapies have variable "success" in suppressing homosexual behavior through behavioral techniques, not a single scientific study shows that any form of psychotherapy can change sexual orientation. Anecdotal reports of such "cures" stand in stark contrast to the psychological trauma done to many homosexuals unfortunate enough to attempt such therapy.</p>
        <p>Such claims about the efficacy of psychoanalytic treatment in changing sexual orientation is as unethical and irresponsible as the assertion that antidepressant medication, an excellent treatment for some forms of depression, will turn a man into a fish. It does a disservice to psychoanalysis, which offers rich and valuable insights into the human mind.</p>
        <p>Homosexuality, like heterosexuality, represents complex and deeply ingrained patterns of thinking, feeling and behavior, which are not well understood. The assumption that homosexuality is an illness that needs to be "cured" is a judgment that reflects deeply held esthetic and moral biases of Western culture.</p>
        <p>Homosexuality is not an illness by any of the usual criteria in medicine, such as an increased risk of morbidity or mortality, painful symptoms or social, interpersonal or occupational dysfunction as a result of homosexuality itself. Nor do homosexuals have higher rates of mental disorders such as major depression, schizophrenia or personality disorders compared with heterosexuals.</p>
        <p>However, it is little wonder that many gay men and women come to psychiatrists in pain and turmoil about their sexual identity, given the hostile treatment they receive in our society. Generalizations about the nature of homosexuality drawn from patient populations are extremely limited and apt to be flawed because these patients are by definition suffering from mental problems and are not representative of the majority not in therapy.</p>
        <p>Intellectually open dialogue about sexual orientation is difficult, given the strong feelings that the topic of sexuality engenders. But psychiatrists have an ethical responsibility to be aware of their own biases and assumptions as they have a profound impact on the welfare of their patients. The basis of sound medical treatment must be scientific data, not the esthetics or beliefs of the physician. RICHARD A. FRIEDMAN, M.D. Assistant Professor of Psychiatry Cornell University Medical College New York, Sept. 20, 1991</p>
