        <p>The leaders of Croatia and Serbia met here for five hours today under the auspices of the European Community, but they left for Yugoslavia afterward apparently no closer to agreement than before.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands, acting for the community-sponsored peace conference, outlined at a news conference a proposed settlement under which Yugoslav Army forces would withdraw from Croatia "hopefully within one month from now" while political negotiations were conducted on the future shape of Yugoslavia.

        <p>The leaders of Croatia and Serbia met here for five hours today under the auspices of the European Community, but they left for Yugoslavia afterward apparently no closer to agreement than before.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands, acting for the community-sponsored peace conference, outlined at a news conference a proposed settlement under which Yugoslav Army forces would withdraw from Croatia "hopefully within one month from now" while political negotiations were conducted on the future shape of Yugoslavia. This optimistic scenario is similar to the one the community has been advancing since it began taking an interest in the Yugoslav civil war at the end of June.</p>
        <p>Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, sitting on Mr. van den Broek's left, said the proposal was "realistic" as long as Serbia's idea of a centralized Yugoslavia was prominent in the political negotiations.</p>
        <p>Franjo Tudjman, the President of Croatia, sitting at Mr. van den Broek's right, retorted that the question of a loose federation or a centralized government was irrelevant since Croatia had declared its independence from Yugoslavia on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>As he hurried from the news conference later, Mr. Tudjman was asked if the session today represented an advance in the peace process. "It is if the army withdraws," he replied. "I know they should withdraw but I don't know when or how many." He said he had received no assurances of a withdrawal.</p>
        <p>Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, the Yugoslav Defense Minister, who also attended the meeting, stood aside from the controversy. "The responsibility is on all parties," the general said. "The army never had any intention of imposing any political decisions on the country."</p>
        <p>The peace conference is to resume at the Hague on Monday. The foreign ministers of all six Yugoslav regions are to attend.</p>
        <p>There has been a lull in combat in Yugoslavia since cease-fire arrangements began in Croatia on Tuesday.  But scattered mortar fire on Wednesday killed four members of a Serbian television team and more firing was reported today from the besieged Croatian cities of Vukovar and Osijek.</p>
        <p>Croatian radio said nine people had been killed and 32 wounded in clashes in and around Vukovar, The Associated Press reported. The radio said that army tanks supported by infantry had advanced on the Croation stronghold, but that the force had been beaten back four hours later.</p>

        <p>Gorbachev Invites Leaders</p>
        <p>MOSCOW, Oct. 10 (Reuters) President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today invited the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia to Moscow for peace talks.</p>
        <p>"President Gorbachev has already invited the two to come to Moscow in the nearest future," a spokesman, Vladimir Tumarkin, said.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Gorbachev would probably meet the two leaders individually rather than in joint talks, but gave no indication whether either had accepted the invitations.</p>
        <p>More than 1,000 people have been killed since Croatia declared independence in June and the republic's Serbian minority rebelled. Mr. Gorbachev has said events in multi-ethnic Yugoslavia are a portent of what the Soviet Union faces if it continues to disintegrate.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union had kept a low diplomatic profile on the Yugoslav crisis while calling for a cease-fire and negotiations.</p>
