        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>According to a House Banking Committee report, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's decreased supervision of smaller banks and other questionable practices have resulted in billions of dollars in losses to this country's deposit insurance fund.</p>
        <p>Readers should be aware of another potentially misguided initiative by the Comptroller of the Currency, which could have serious financial consequences for lower- and middle-class homebuyers and taxpayers, and the United States banking system.</p>
        <p>In late August, the Comptroller of the Currency proposed to alter rules governing real estate appraisals by raising the current $50,000 threshold on real estate transactions to $100,000. Under this proposal, national banks would not be required to obtain real estate appraisals from licensed or certified appraisers for transactions of less than $100,000.</p>
        <p>Congress has found that appraisal deficiencies contributed significantly to many failures in the savings and loan industry. What makes this rule so ominous is that if adopted by other bank regulatory agencies it would effectively exclude more than half of all this country's residential real estate mortgage loans (approximately 4.1 million home sales a year) from the appraisal requirements.</p>
        <p>It could be especially troubling for savings and loan-plagued cities like Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, where the median sales price for a home falls well below $100,000. Commercial transactions below $100,000, which represent additional risk to the banking industry, would also be exempt under the proposal.</p>
        <p>Appraisals provide vital market information, helping assure safe underwriting practices and that adequate collateral stands behind each loan. A floor of $100,000 only increases the likelihood that many properties will not be accurately appraised, thereby leading to imprudent loans that jeopardize the solvency of financial institutions and threaten taxpayers with future bailouts.</p>
        <p>The House Banking Committee report documents the results of the hands-off approach to financial regulation of the 1980's. Isn't it ironic that the Comptroller of the Currency is again proposing to decrease financial oversight of our banks by exempting more than half of residential real estate and many commercial transactions from proper appraisal guidelines? RICHARD G. PIETROWITZ President, Appraisal Institute Hackensack, N.J., Sept. 27, 1991</p>
