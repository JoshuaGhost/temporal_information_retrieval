        <p>"Therapists See Religion as an Aid, Not an Illusion" (Science Times Sept. 10) discusses the increasing attention of psychologists to religion and rejection of Freud's opinion that religion is a neurotic illusion. You cite eight psychologists, a child psychiatrist and two Freudian psychoanalysts who look favorably on religion's role in emotional wholeness. You refer to Job's communion with God and quote a psychoanalyst saying when he was in training, "the attitude was that if a patient brought up religion, you either ignored it or tried to show him it was neurotic." He adds: "But religion is not necessarily neurosis. It may be something that helps people come to terms with an unkind reality."</p>

        <p>"Therapists See Religion as an Aid, Not an Illusion" (Science Times Sept. 10) discusses the increasing attention of psychologists to religion and rejection of Freud's opinion that religion is a neurotic illusion. You cite eight psychologists, a child psychiatrist and two Freudian psychoanalysts who look favorably on religion's role in emotional wholeness. You refer to Job's communion with God and quote a psychoanalyst saying when he was in training, "the attitude was that if a patient brought up religion, you either ignored it or tried to show him it was neurotic." He adds: "But religion is not necessarily neurosis. It may be something that helps people come to terms with an unkind reality."</p>
        <p>C. G. Jung dismissed Freud's pathologizing of religion in the early part of this century. Jung's "Answer to Job" and his role in founding Alcoholics Anonymous ("spiritus contra spiritum") grew out of his deep concern for the religious nature of healing. The belief in a classical Freudian doctrine is losing hold on today's wiser, less rigid Freudian analysis.</p>
        <p>"In Modern Man in Search of a Soul," published in the United States in 1933, Jung wrote, "Religions, in my opinion, with all they are and assert, are so near to the human soul that psychology least of all can afford to overlook them." He also said, "Religions are psychotherapeutic systems in the most actual meaning of the word, and in the widest measure" (1934), and "No matter what the world thinks about religious experience, the one who has it, possesses the great treasure of a thing that has provided him with a source of life, meaning and beauty, and that has given a new splendor to the world and to mankind" (1931).</p>
        <p>Jung's ideas are being rediscovered by lay people and also by Freudians. HARRY A. WILMER, M.D. Salado, Texas, Sept. 20, 1991 The writer is a senior analyst, Interregional Society of Jungian Analysts.</p>
