        <p>THE WRIGHT BROTHERS: How They Invented the Airplane. By Russell Freedman. With original photographs by Wilbur and Orville Wright. Holiday House. $16.95. (Ages 8 and up) If, as it's been said, the airplane was the first invention fully documented by photographs, the success of this engrossing book comes from its intelligent text and its selective use of some of those memorable images.
