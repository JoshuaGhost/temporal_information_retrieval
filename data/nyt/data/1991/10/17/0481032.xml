        <p>The Northrop Corporation reported today that its third- quarter net income rose 26.8 percent, helped by strong sales of its B-2 bomber.</p>
        <p>Northrop said it earned $53.8 million, or $1.14 a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $42.4 million, or 90 cents a share, in the 1990 period. Sales rose 22 percent, to $1.55 billion, from $1.27 billion.</p>

        <p>The Northrop Corporation reported today that its third- quarter net income rose 26.8 percent, helped by strong sales of its B-2 bomber.</p>
        <p>Northrop said it earned $53.8 million, or $1.14 a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $42.4 million, or 90 cents a share, in the 1990 period. Sales rose 22 percent, to $1.55 billion, from $1.27 billion.</p>
        <p>Operating profit was higher in each of the company's three main businesses: aircraft; electronics, and missiles and unmanned vehicle systems, said Kent Kresa, the chairman.</p>
        <p>Growth in sales of the radar- evading, B-2, which is shaped like a bat, caused the overall profit increase, more than offsetting lower margins on the aircraft parts Northrop builds for fighter and passenger jets.</p>
        <p>Besides increased B-2 production, the company's revenue rose in its missile and unmanned vehicle systems segments. But those from its electronics business declined.</p>
        <p>Northrop had hoped to lead the team building the Air Force's next-generation advanced tactical fighter. With the loss of the program to a team led by the Lockheed Corporation, and future B-2 financing uncertain, the company's future big-ticket programs are uncertain, although profits and sales are high for now.</p>
        <p>Net debt was down, to $559 million in the quarter, 42 percent below the year-earlier figure of $964 million and down 56 percent from its peak of $1.28 billion in June 1989.</p>
        <p>Northrop's stock lost 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange today, to $23.875.</p>
