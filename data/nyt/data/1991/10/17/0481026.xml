        <p>"Many details of the music disappeared because the sound track was imperfect, very faint," he said yesterday at the beginning of a 10-day visit to New York from England, where he is a sculptor.

        <p>OLEG PROKOFIEV was always upset when he saw "Alexander Nevsky," the 1938 film whose score was composed by his father, Sergei Prokofiev, because he could barely hear the music.</p>
        <p>"Many details of the music disappeared because the sound track was imperfect, very faint," he said yesterday at the beginning of a 10-day visit to New York from England, where he is a sculptor. "In addition, they had to finish the film urgently: Comrade Stalin wanted to see it in a hurry."</p>
        <p>No one will have to strain to hear the score when the Sergei Eisenstein film is shown with new subtitles at Avery Fisher Hall on Oct. 25.</p>
        <p>Accompanying the movie -- a depiction of the victory by Alexander Nevsky and a band of peasants over invading Teutonic knights in 1242 -- will be the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus conducted by SEIJI OZAWA.  Mr. Prokofiev, whose translation of his father's diary is about to be published in Britain, will talk at an "Offstage Conversation" this evening at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>The score for the film, he recalled yesterday, was his father's first work upon returning to the Soviet Union after 18 years abroad, and "is something truly Russian." Though Oleg was only 7 years old when the movie came out, it had a direct impact on him.</p>
        <p>"It was quite hard for me to adapt to life in Russia, and I remember that my fellow pupils teased me a lot because I dressed differently, because of my accent," he said. "When the film came out and suddenly my father's name was all over the place, they continued to tease -- but with a sense of respect."</p>
