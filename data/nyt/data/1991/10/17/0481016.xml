        <p>Breaking months of official silence about Japan's scandal-ridden financial markets, a senior American Treasury official said today that Japan could not "go on with business as usual" and that the United States would use the mounting evidence of improper behavior to press for a far more open financial system in Tokyo.</p>

        <p>Breaking months of official silence about Japan's scandal-ridden financial markets, a senior American Treasury official said today that Japan could not "go on with business as usual" and that the United States would use the mounting evidence of improper behavior to press for a far more open financial system in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>The official, David C. Mulford, the Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, also told reporters tonight that "everyone knew what was going on" in the Tokyo market, "and they tolerated it."</p>
        <p>He appeared to be referring to Japan's Ministry of Finance, which has been sharply criticized for failing to take enforcement actions against nearly all of the country's biggest brokerage houses. The securities firms have admitted that they secretly compensated their biggest clients for market losses. Steered Clear of Scandal</p>
        <p>Until now American officials have steered clear of public criticism of how Japan has handled the scandal, saying that it is largely a domestic affair for the Japanese financial authorities to handle. But Mr. Mulford's comments to a small group of reporters tonight appeared a clear indication that that position was changing although the new position had not been expressed to Japanese officials yet. It now appears the United States will use the scandals to back up demands for a far more "transparent" market "where everyone knows what the rules are."</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulford's comments came two days after Japan's Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, stepped down in what he said was an act intended to take responsibility for the Government's failure to oversee the biggest brokerage houses. But Mr. Hashimoto's term was within two weeks of termination, and most political analysts here viewed his move as largely an empty gesture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulford also arrived just as the biggest Japanese brokerage houses were locking the doors at many of their branch offices for several weeks, as ordered by the Finance Ministry as punishment.</p>
        <p>Starting Thursday, Mr. Mulford will meet with officials of the ministry to urge much broader deregulation and access to Japan's financial markets, and he clearly plans to use the scandals as ammunition. But there may be a shortage of powerful conferees.</p>
        <p>Japan is not only without a finance minister for a few weeks, but it is also without a leadership. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was pushed aside a week ago, and a new prime minister -- mostly likely Kiichi Miyazawa, who was forced to resign as finance minister in 1989 -- will not take over until next month.</p>
        <p>Thus, it is unlikely that Mr. Mulford will receive much of a blueprint for change, at least for several months. Rules Are Unwritten</p>
        <p>"We have scandals of our own, of course, like Salomon Brothers," he said. "But Salomon broke clearly laid-out rules. Here in Japan they were playing by rules that were never written down, and no one knew exactly what they are."</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulford refused to take sides explicitly on one debate that is dividing the bureaucracy and political worlds here: whether Japan should create its own version of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The idea has been vigorously opposed by the Finance Ministry, which has killed several of the proposals that would require it to shed some of its current powers in favor of an independent regulatory body.</p>
        <p>"We have an open mind, and we want to hear if they are willing to take on this problem aggressively," Mr. Mulford said. "It is a question of attitude. And if they won't take this on aggressively, the Government should think about creating an organization that will." Later he added that "if the ministry's approach is that you can put this on the back burner and go on with business as usual, then I think we may press for another institution."</p>
