        <p>Detectives at the 68th Precinct in Brooklyn who thought they had seen everything say it is a New York City first: a killing apparently committed for bear gallbladders, which have sold for as much as $45,000 in Asia.</p>
        <p>The 39-year-old victim, identified by the police as Haeng Gu Lee of 170 72d Street in the Bay Ridge section, was a Korean-American trader who apparently exported animal parts to the Far East, where black bear gallbladders are prized as powerful medicine.</p>
        <p>The detective in charge of the investigation, Capt. William Plackenmeyer, said that Mr. Lee was found stabbed to death in his apartment Saturday night. Captain Plackenmeyer said the apartment had been ransacked and chunks of bear fur were scattered around.</p>
        <p>The killer apparently stole an undetermined number of gallbladders from the three freezers in Mr. Lee's apartment that he had used to store animal parts, Captain Plackenmeyer said.</p>
        <p>Captain Plackenmeyer said the 68th had never handled a case like this. "We have a lot of learning to do," he said.</p>
        <p>Others confirmed the idea that bear gallbladders are valued as medicine in Asia. Ground into tablets, the gallbladders are taken as pain relievers, "probably the same way we use aspirin," said Ed Espinoza of the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service. "The reason they are so valuable is they are believed to be a panacea."</p>
        <p>Grizzly bear gallbladders are hard to come by because fewer than 1,000 grizzlies are left in the continental United States. The Fish and Wildlife Service says grizzly gallbladders can bring $10,000 on the black market.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Espinoza said that black bear gallbladders are even more sought after in Asia, and that the trade has been increasing recently, driving up prices. "A gallbladder which will sell in Idaho for about $15 will sell in Hawaii for $1,500 and in Korea for $15,000," he said. One gallbladder is known to have sold for $45,000, he said.</p>
        <p>Ed Feldmann, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said that selling and shipping bear gallbladders is legal in New York State as long as the bears have been hunted legally, during the hunting season by hunters with permits. The bear-hunting season in the Adirondacks began on Saturday, but state officials maintain that many animals are killed out of season.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espinoza raised a question about whether the stolen gallbladders were what Mr. Lee would have wanted his customers to be think. . "In studies we've done, about 16 percent of the bear gallbladders in the United States tend to be fakes. They're really from pigs. So there is enormous fraud."</p>
