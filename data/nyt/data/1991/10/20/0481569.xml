        <p>For a team dressed in silver and blue that too often finishes simply blue, this was to be the season in which the Detroit Lion with the biggest heart and insurmountable courage would lead his teammates to the light.</p>
        <p>Yes, in 1991, the Detroit Lions, who finished 6-10 last year, were going to ride Barry Sanders's bulky shoulders and wondrous legs out of the darkness to a winning record, the playoffs and, with a touch of his magic, possibly beyond.</p>
        <p>But on the first day of September, in the first game of the season for this newly dedicated and more talented bunch, Sanders came up hurt. His ribs were sore. At first, he said he could play against the Washington Redskins. And then, minutes before the game, he said he could not.</p>
        <p>The Lions were routed, 45-0.</p>
        <p>Same old Lions. Same old heartbreak.</p>
        <p>"I had hurt my ribs a couple of weeks before the game," Sanders, the 1988 Heisman Trophy winner from Oklahoma State, said recently. "I had played in the last preseason game and I went to Washington sure I was going to play. The whole team was under the impression I was going to play. The game plan had been structured around me.</p>
        <p>"I warmed up and I felt the soreness. I talked to Coach Fontes. He said to go in there and take the first run and see how it felt. I went back out to loosen and I knew I couldn't go at all.</p>
        <p>"I'm sure a lot of guys were upset. I'm sure it was an unpleasant surprise. That's where a lot of different stories were made."</p>
        <p>One story had the owner of the Lions, William Clay Ford, alleging that Sanders had no heart. There were whispers that some of his teammates questioned his courage.</p>
        <p>Had they been wrong all along about Sanders, a third-year pro who was the Lions' top draft pick and third over all in 1989? all along? Had his desire been tempered by his new contract, reportedly calling for an additional $4.2 million and an extra season appended to his five-year, $5.9 million deal of 1989?  Was he really worth it? Had his teammates placed their trust in wimp? Bouncing Back</p>
        <p>The answers are known now. Sanders says he knew them then. He was not surprised and was certain he would "make the critics eat their words" in Detroit's second game, against Green Bay, and he scored a touchdown as the Lions rebounded with a victory. Then, as the Lions won their next four games, Sanders rushed for more than 115 yards in each game.</p>
        <p>He is not shocked that the Lions (5-1) lead the National Conference Central Division. And he fully expects that they will beat the San Francisco 49ers (2-4) on Sunday afternoon in Candlestick Park and keep their high hopes alive.</p>
        <p>His teammates will now tell you without reservation that Sanders is to the National Football League what Michael Jordan is to the National Basketball Association and Wayne Gretzky is to the National Hockey League. In a football season short on superstars with quarterbacks Randall Cunningham and Joe Montana out, Sanders is No. 1. He is the talk of his peers in N.F.L. locker rooms and will be showcased today by CBS in a nationally televised game. Better Than Payton?</p>
        <p>Sanders is already better than Walter Payton ever was, said Payton, the league's leading career rusher. He is the Lions' soul and inspiration. He is their light.</p>
        <p>And he is much more.</p>
        <p>Sanders is a remarkable mix of thundering talent and low-key personality. After winning the Heisman, he left Oklahoma State as a junior after the school was placed on probation. He was determined to eradicate the hard times that his family, including 10 siblings, had suffered. He was dedicated to becoming All-Pro on the inside, and turned to Christianity as his source of inspiration. He receives a visit here once a month from the Rev. Greg Ball, a minister from Austin, Tex., who helps him remain spiritually fine-tuned.</p>
        <p>The player conducts Bible study every Wednesday night, a chapel service on Sunday mornings before games and relentless Bible study at home in between. He gives 10 percent of his income to his church back home in Wichita, Kan., and gave $200,000 to the church when he first signed with the Lions. He is unmarried, and he says he practices celibacy.</p>
        <p>Sanders views himself simply as a "seed," adding in explanation that a seed can be planted in hard ground and become thorns or grow bright. "I always want to be a seed on good ground," he said softly.</p>
        <p>Sanders, at the ripe age of 23, speaks with deep conviction. His teammates have no doubts about his words.</p>
        <p>"This is a very inspirational young man, and 'young' is the key word here," said Eddie Murray, the Lions' 35-year-old 12th-year kicker. "Heck, I was 24 when I was a rookie, he was only 21. Now he's in his third year, but he's light years ahead of most people in the league his age in maturity."</p>
        <p>"He lifts us up," said the Lions' coach, Wayne Fontes. "On the bus, on the plane, in practices, in games, in warm-ups."</p>
        <p>Jerry Ball, the Lions' fifth-year nose tackle, said of Sanders: "In work ethic, character, discipline, in every way, he sets a standard for each and every one on this team. I want a championship. Everyone here wants one. Barry is the biggest factor in us getting one on the field and off the field. He has the standing now to speak up, to voice his opinions and make some heads roll. This is the next step for Barry and he has to make it."</p>
        <p>It is a huge step for Sanders. The Van, Please</p>
        <p>By nature, he is so unassuming and quiet and modest that it is difficult to imagine he will become a spokesman of any kind. Millions of dollars are at his doorstep in possible endorsements, but Sanders has yet to cash in. Back in 1989, Fontes was prepared to send a limousine to the airport when Sanders first arrived. Sanders wanted to ride in a van like the 2d- and 3d- and 11th-round draft picks.</p>
        <p>Sanders, however, brought a cruising running style.</p>
        <p>In his rookie season, he gained 1,470 yards, finishing 10 yards shy of tying the Chiefs' Christian Okoye for the league rushing title. He averaged 5.3 yards a carry, with 14 touchdowns. Last year, he won the title, gaining 1,304 yards, with an average of 5.1 and with 13 scores.</p>
        <p>He can start and stop faster than any other back and he is able to read defenses on the move. He cuts and slashes and explodes and changes directions with ease. He glides. The Lions have revamped their run-and-shoot offense to insure that Sanders gets the football more frequently.</p>
        <p>Going into Sunday's game he has 640 yards, which puts him on track to win the rushing title again.</p>
        <p>But everything with Sanders starts on the inside.</p>
        <p>"There is a notion that being a Christian makes an athlete soft, passive and limp," he said. "I believe a real man is a man of God. There is so much hypocrisy out there, though. I understand those who doubt."</p>
        <p>Sanders is frugal. Last summer, he paid a visit to Barney's, the men's clothing store in Manhattan, and he said later that he almost fainted when he saw the price tags for suits at $800 and $900. But he is giving. After last season, he spent $60,000 on Rolex watches for his linemen. His new contract provides $10,000 for each starting offensive lineman if Sanders rushes for 1,000 yards this season. The linemen's goal is to get him 2,000.</p>
        <p>He believes there is something left for him to do after football, something different, something that will fulfill his desire to have an impact on people's lives. But for now, he is serious about the game he plays. Listen closely, because this is probably the closest one will come to hearing a boast from Barry Sanders:</p>
        <p>"I have every confidence I will have a championship before I am done with pro football," he said, "and the ring that goes along with it. Who knows? Maybe even two."  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
