        <p>THOUGH it may seem academic to many gardeners, it should be pointed out that there is a huge difference between fall and spring gardens. What seems prolific and filled with foliage now will be barren and empty come spring.</p>
        <p>All this is another way of saying to think spring when planting bulbs now. Too many gardeners, especially those who are new to the experience, forget that many of the plants they see now will not be there in spring, because the plants have reputations as lazy risers. And if there are no plants to fill these voids, the bare spots will remain until the late risers begin to push up from the soil.</p>

        <p>THOUGH it may seem academic to many gardeners, it should be pointed out that there is a huge difference between fall and spring gardens. What seems prolific and filled with foliage now will be barren and empty come spring.</p>
        <p>All this is another way of saying to think spring when planting bulbs now. Too many gardeners, especially those who are new to the experience, forget that many of the plants they see now will not be there in spring, because the plants have reputations as lazy risers. And if there are no plants to fill these voids, the bare spots will remain until the late risers begin to push up from the soil.</p>
        <p>One of the laziest of these plants is the popular perennial platycodon. The delightful blue flower, though magnificent when it blooms in late June, has the bad habit of appearing at its own pace come spring. The shoots never seem to poke above ground until everything else has started to appear and many gardeners have thought the perennial was lost forever.</p>
        <p>The solution is to make those bare patches attractive in spring by planting bulbs near the perennial. A perfect candidate is daffodil. These fine spring flowers poke up with a collar of foliage and splendid blooms. Because the platycodon stalks are there now, the bulbs can be planted without doing any harm. When the platycodon stalks brown off later in the season, they can be cut to the ground, and the daffodil bulbs will not be disturbed.</p>
        <p>Another perennial with a similarly lazy reputation is astilbe. It, too, has the bad habit of pushing up late, and because the plants are visible now, bulbs can safely be planted in between. Tulip bulbs do a serviceable job of showing off in spring, and their foliage ripens rapidly to be out of the way long before the astilbes decide to push up and bloom.</p>
        <p>But the slowest of all to wake up in spring is hosta. This perennial is so snug in its underground harbor come spring that many gardeners forget exactly where the plants are. Bulbs to select for these perennials are the late-blooming tulips.</p>
        <p>To plant the bulbs, simply lift the huge collar of foliage and tuck the bulbs around the stems. But be careful not to dig too close to the stems, since the hostas do thicken with time, and there is danger of smashing into the tender underground shoots with a trowel. In the spring, however, there will be color in that part of the garden in spite of the fact that the hostas are late to appear. Since the hostas need to have room to spread their huge, showy leaves, bulb plantings can be generous.</p>
        <p>Peonies are not quite as tardy, since the red-pink tips of their shoots do appear. But these huge plants take their time to form and flower. Crocus, because they are early to flower, are ideal bulbs to tuck around them. What is more, crocus bulbs multiply generously, and once established with the peony plantings, they are great show-offs. The low-growing crocus flowers and the bulb foliage are long gone if the peonies have to be sprayed because of botrytis problems.</p>
        <p>Although they are handsome now, two low-growing ornamental grasses will disappear by the first few hard frosts. These are the Japanese grasses hakonechloa and blood grass, which have gained prominent places in garden landscapes. Both of these grasses are showy now with either golden or red-blood leaves. But these grasses will all too soon "go down," as British gardeners often say, and there will be nothing in their places until quite late next spring. The trick? Lift the showy leafy arches of these grasses and tuck a few bulbs underneath.</p>
        <p>Excellent candidates for these places are the low-growing daffodils. The bulbs will poke up their foliage early enough to show where they are, and they will bloom easily. Then when the grasses start to push up, their abundant leaves will cover the ripening daffodil foliage that remains for a long time.</p>
        <p>One word of caution though, particularly when planting underneath the handsome hakonechloa. This excellent grass is slow to establish, but when it settles in, it spreads quickly by runners. If these runners are found underneath the handsome leaves, they can be cut out and used to plant elsewhere or given to friends. But be careful when planting bulbs that the roots of these runners have not been damaged, since they are quite near the surface.</p>
        <p>Although most gardeners think of the main spring bulbs as tulips, daffodils and crocus, the often forgotten Alliums, bulbs of the onion family, are neglected. Since most of these fine bulbs bloom a few weeks later than the more familiar spring-flowering bulbs, more of them could be included. Particularly delightful are Allium cernuum, often called the nodding onion, with rosy blooms or the perky Allium moly with its yellow balls of color that were often included in European gardens for good luck. Both of these bulbs are diminutive and would fit neatly under the foliage of grasses or near perennials, where they will display blooms in spring.  GARDENING</p>
