        <p>The arm looked real, but it was the blood that did it. Certainly the blood was real. A muscular left arm with the sleeve of a New York Yankees jersey on one end and a pitcher's glove on the other. It lay across the black leather seat of a Porsche 941 parked on Riverside Drive. Within the pitcher's glove was a bloody baseball and a piece of paper. Frankie Skoyles didn't bother with the paper. All he knew was he wanted to get away quick. It was 11 P.M. and there were still people about. But first he'd pull the hook on the fire alarm box to bring the law. He might steal cars for a living, but that didn't mean he wasn't a fan. The way Frankie saw it, if baseball was a four-season sport, he wouldn't steal cars at all.</p>
        <p>Of course he recognized the Porsche, but it was the vanity plate that tipped him off: MALONE, for Hooker Malone, star New York Yankees pitcher, who tomorrow night would start the seventh game of the World Series against Cincinnati. Not that Malone had been a star so far. He had won Game 1 by a single run, then clutched in Game 4, got pulled in the fifth inning and the Yankees had lost by three. But that morning in The Post he claimed to be "psyched" and in The Times he said he was "prepared." He'd been seeing a shrink and was eager.</p>

        <p>The arm looked real, but it was the blood that did it. Certainly the blood was real. A muscular left arm with the sleeve of a New York Yankees jersey on one end and a pitcher's glove on the other. It lay across the black leather seat of a Porsche 941 parked on Riverside Drive. Within the pitcher's glove was a bloody baseball and a piece of paper. Frankie Skoyles didn't bother with the paper. All he knew was he wanted to get away quick. It was 11 P.M. and there were still people about. But first he'd pull the hook on the fire alarm box to bring the law. He might steal cars for a living, but that didn't mean he wasn't a fan. The way Frankie saw it, if baseball was a four-season sport, he wouldn't steal cars at all.</p>
        <p>Of course he recognized the Porsche, but it was the vanity plate that tipped him off: MALONE, for Hooker Malone, star New York Yankees pitcher, who tomorrow night would start the seventh game of the World Series against Cincinnati. Not that Malone had been a star so far. He had won Game 1 by a single run, then clutched in Game 4, got pulled in the fifth inning and the Yankees had lost by three. But that morning in The Post he claimed to be "psyched" and in The Times he said he was "prepared." He'd been seeing a shrink and was eager.</p>
        <p>It had tickled Skoyles to steal the pitcher's Porsche. Hadn't Reggie Jackson had his Porsche stolen a few years ago? Among thieves, stealing fast cars from sports figures was a minor art form. But he should have been suspicious when he found the door open, and even more suspicious when the alarm didn't go off. Then there was that bloody arm lying across the front seat. "My heart sunk," he later told his girlfriend, Babs.</p>
        <p>And so Skoyles had fled empty-handed, or almost empty-handed; it hurt his crooked pride to tiptoe away with nothing. In the glove box he found a hard-cover edition of "Saratoga Hexameter," which was almost his favorite book, and this he cherished, because, although he already owned the paperback, the hardback was rare and valuable. He paused a moment to read the first few wonderful paragraphs, then he pulled the hook.</p>
        <p>In her two years as a sports reporter, Bridget Belfry had got used to being the one with the questions. Indeed, she had penetrated some of the most private locker rooms in the country in pursuit of masculine mounds of muscle, protected only by a small towel, with leading questions about their athletic prowess. But here she was, pinned in a straight chair while four men shook their fists at her and shouted. Couldn't she take them to court? Unfortunately, it was court with which she was being threatened: a long jail term, in fact.</p>
        <p>And who were these men? The Commissioner of Police, a top honcho in the F.B.I., a vice president in the Yankees organization and her own managing editor. And why were they so angry?</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. honcho, Prosper Gibbons, waved a bloody severed arm at Bridget -- an arm that had turned out to be plastic. "You have a private interview with Hooker Malone at 9 P.M. in an Upper West Side bar. By 11 he's been kidnapped. And you say you know nothing about it?"</p>
        <p>The Police Commissioner waved a bloody piece of paper on which was written, "We want a million smackers by tomorrow or we'll send you the real one." His face was a deep purple. "I'm tired of pushy reporters! This trick will land you in jail!"</p>
        <p>And the Yankee vice president shouted, "We all know how low you'll go for a story!"</p>
        <p>Chuck Verity, her managing editor, kept silent but bore the expression of a man who finds a mouse paw floating in his soup. Part Two</p>
        <p>"We're kicking the Belfry woman."</p>
        <p>Sgt. Art Huck nodded and waited for the rest of it. Gibbons, the local F.B.I. bureau chief, was a holdover from the Hoover years and even looked like J. Edgar, down to the shaven temples and distended eyes like black rubber door bumpers. Just the fact that there was a bureau chief who still wanted to resemble Hoover told Huck all he needed to know about Gibbons before he'd ever opened his mouth.</p>
        <p>"Washington gave us a possible on that partial print your boys lifted from the door handle of Malone's Porsche," the Federal man went on. "It belongs to a professional car thief named Franklin Skoyles. Do you know him?"</p>
        <p>"No, I'm general service, not grand theft auto. You want us to pull him in?"</p>
        <p>Gibbons smiled. It wasn't an expression that lived comfortably on his face. "We're ahead of you there, Sergeant. One of our field agents who used to be a public defender recognized him this morning from the old days and arrested him on the street. We're holding him downstairs."</p>
        <p>The stairs belonged to the Federal Building, on the 16th floor of which the two were facing each other from opposite sides of a desk the size of Huck's apartment. The Commissioner had gone outside department protocol to appoint Art Huck as liaison between the N.Y.P.D. and the F.B.I. in the Malone kidnapping. Huck had been told the decision was based on the three years he had spent in Triple A ball before joining the department -- "You speak the lingo, Art" -- but he knew that if the thing turned out to be a publicity stunt, which was more than likely, a sergeant from general service made cheaper wolf bait than, say, a lieutenant from bunco.</p>
        <p>A gangling man of 36, with red hair and a permanent squint from a youth spent chasing balls in the sun in left field, Huck had welcomed the chance to get away from his desk and breathe the sweat-and-mildew air of the Yankees' locker room, an aroma he preferred to the interior of a new car -- even a car like Hooker Malone's Porsche. The odorless, air-conditioned atmosphere of Federal bureaucracy had him out of sorts. "What's a car thief got to do with a snatch?"</p>
        <p>"He claims he didn't steal it. He thought about it, but the arm on the front seat dampened his enthusiasm. He says. Instead he took a book."</p>
        <p>"A literate perp. Well, well. What was it, 'Ball Four'? 'The Boys of Summer'? 'Baseball Joe in the World Series'?" Malone's file said he had basket-weaved his way through N.Y.U. on an athletic scholarship.</p>
        <p>"A whodunit. Something called 'Saratoga Hexameter.' "</p>
        <p>"I read it. So what are you holding Skoyles on, besides bad taste in literature?"</p>
        <p>"Material witness for now. Complicity in kidnapping and extortion if he doesn't cooperate." Gibbons placed a manicured finger alongside his short sharp Hoover nose. "I smell a break."</p>
        <p>"So Bridget Belfry's off the hook?"</p>
        <p>"We want her to think so. I'm still convinced she's involved. It's just a broader conspiracy than we thought at first. Skoyles is a compulsive gambler; our organized crime unit picked him up twice in betting-parlor raids just last year. Suppose he got in so deep with his Sicilian creditors the only way he could pay them back was to ditch the Porsche after the kidnapping? We're talking a major scheme by gamblers to change the odds on the World Series book."</p>
        <p>"With the Belfry woman putting just the right spin on the story in the press." Huck fingered his long rectangular jaw. "It's a theory. But where's the book fit in, the one Skoyles stole?"</p>
        <p>Gibbons sneered, a more natural arrangement of the muscles of his face than the smile had been. "There never was a book. He made it up to explain the fingerprint on the car."</p>
        <p>"Did you toss his place?"</p>
        <p>"Of course. Skoyles claims his apartment was broken into last night. The only thing the thieves took was 'Saratoga Hexameter.' " Part Three</p>
        <p>Bridget Belfry met Juanita Charles at the World Series. Bridget was a stand-in reporter covering the games for an important New York daily. Juanita was a consultant from Pinkerton, helping ball-park security. That year an urban terrorist group had threatened to disrupt the games. The threats proved unfounded. Juanita and Bridget spent most of their time putting up with childish pranks pulled off by the security team and the ballplayers.</p>
        <p>One evening the entire ball team, including their 300-pound coach, came to a private banquet at an uptown hotel, totally nude. Juanita and Bridget were the only women at the banquet, and as Juanita said later that night, "It wouldn't have been so bad if they had at least showered before dinner."</p>
        <p>As security liaison Juanita set Bridget up to get photographs of certain important players in the rather compromising circumstances of a victory orgy. This story, coupled with Bridget's exceptional coverage of the four-game sweep, made her career as a sports reporter. Neither the ballplayers nor the ball club ever complained, because Bridget didn't send in the pictures of the illegal drug use at the bash. Juanita, however, was fired.</p>
        <p>Juanita was part black, part Puerto Rican and a descendant of a notorious white private detective who worked New York City before World War II. She was streetwise and beautiful in a gap-toothed, big-boned kind of way. She had little use for white people in general, or men in particular. But she kept employed because she wasn't afraid of gunfire and because she could get information out of a corpse.</p>
        <p>"I'm glad you could come," Bridget said. She stood to about shoulder height on the tall detective. They had agreed to meet at a small delicatessen on West 57th Street.</p>
        <p>"Five hundred dollars, honey." Juanita pursed her lips and held out her hand.</p>
        <p>Bridget handed the detective an envelope and Juanita sat down to count her money. She held up two $100 bills to the light, making sure they weren't queer.</p>
        <p>"I'm in big trouble," Bridget said.</p>
        <p>"That's what you said on the phone. So what is it?"</p>
        <p>"Hooker Malone."</p>
        <p>Juanita stood up while shoving the envelope into her shoulder bag.</p>
        <p>"Hey, what about my $500?"</p>
        <p>"</p>
        <p>My</p>
        <p>$500. I told you that's what it would cost for me to sit down with you. I didn't say nothin' about Hooker Malone or murder."</p>
        <p>"I met with him two hours before he disappeared."</p>
        <p>Juanita's eyes were light brown, almost golden. Bridget could see them shine.</p>
        <p>"He told me that he was under serious pressure to throw the game," Bridget said, and Juanita sat back down. "He said that he had a plan to fool them, to fix it so that he wouldn't have to play."</p>
        <p>"Fake a kidnapping?"</p>
        <p>"He didn't say. All he did was give me an address and a phone number that he wanted me to check out if he didn't call me by 6 this morning."</p>
        <p>"And?"</p>
        <p>"The police let me go at 8. There was no message at work or at my answering service. Nobody answered the phone. So I decided to go out there."</p>
        <p>"Where?"</p>
        <p>"A little house on the Island. It's out in the woods, you couldn't even find it without directions."</p>
        <p>"And?"</p>
        <p>"Nobody was there. There had been a fight. Furniture everywhere and, and. . . ."</p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>"The kitchen sink was full of blood. Dried black blood." Bridget gagged and covered her face with her hand.</p>
        <p>"Why'd he tell you where he was?"</p>
        <p>"I knew about the gambling already. I'd written a story but then buried it when he'd convinced me that he'd stopped. We'd been close a few years ago."</p>
        <p>"That's all?"</p>
        <p>"No, no. . . . There was a phone call. . . . I answered it. The voice at the other end, a man's voice, said, 'Babs?' And when I said 'yes' they hung up. Can you help me, Juanita?"</p>
        <p>"Why didn't you tell the cops when you had the chance?"</p>
        <p>"I promised him. If the cops found out about his plans the mob would know in half an hour. They'd kill him." Part Four</p>
        <p>"O.K.," Juanita said, letting her breath out slowly. "I'll help."</p>
        <p>"You'll help?"</p>
        <p>"You hard of hearing? Let's head on out to that place on the Island where you saw blood in the sink."</p>
        <p>"Just the two of us?"</p>
        <p>"Don't be silly. There's going to be</p>
        <p>five</p>
        <p>of us. First thing, I'll get hold of Doc Manyshoes."</p>
        <p>Doc Manyshoes was the team's physician. His real name was Emanuel Shulman, the first name having been shortened long ago to Manny. Because he often prescribed a change of footwear for a player with knee or ankle problems, Manny Shulman had been shortened by the players to "Manyshoes."</p>
        <p>"Wait a sec," said a bewildered Bridget. "You said there'd be five of us."</p>
        <p>"That's right. You, me, Doc Manyshoes and two other companions" -- here, Juanita reached into her purse and pulled out a gleaming blue-black .38-caliber revolver -- "Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson. It's a Clint Eastwood line, but I like it so much I borrow it once in a while."</p>
        <p>They picked up Doc Manyshoes a half-hour later. "Anything to help one of my boys," he said. The orthopedist was almost like a father to the younger players -- and he was especially fond of Hooker Malone.</p>
        <p>On the drive out to the Island, Doc Manyshoes asked Bridget a lot of probing questions on what she'd seen at the cabin.</p>
        <p>"So," Doc Manyshoes said, "even though there was furniture all over the place, making it look like there'd been an all-out struggle, there was blood only in the sink."</p>
        <p>"Yes," Bridget said slowly. "That is odd, isn't it?"</p>
        <p>"Maybe yes, maybe no," Doc Manyshoes said cryptically. "And the man on the phone said 'Babs?' and hung up?"</p>
        <p>"Yes," Bridget said.</p>
        <p>Juanita looked at Doc Manyshoes out of the corner of her eye. His hair was steel gray, and he was still handsome, although the whites of his eyes had gone to pink from too many postgame beers. Juanita caught the smile beneath his neat salt-and-pepper mustache. The smile was shrewd and thin.</p>
        <p>When they entered the cabin, Bridget recoiled at the smell. Belatedly, she remembered that the smell, somewhere between cruddy and funky, had been there the first time. Now it was overpowering.</p>
        <p>"No matter how many times I smell it, I can't get used to it," Doc Manyshoes said grimly.</p>
        <p>Bridget's blood went to ice. "It's the smell of a rotting corpse, isn't it?" she said, her voice breaking.</p>
        <p>"Huh? Oh, no," Doc Manyshoes said. "It's the smell of bad bachelor cooking. Terrible, terrible thing. . . ."</p>
        <p>"But what about the blood in the sink?" Juanita said.</p>
        <p>Doc Manyshoes looked into the sink, studied the blood. "Just what I thought," he said, reaching into the sink to pick up something translucent. Smiling thinly and shrewdly, he held it up for the women to see. "A fish scale," he said.</p>
        <p>"A fish scale?" Juanita said.</p>
        <p>"You hard of hearing?" Bridget said.</p>
        <p>"Hooker loves to catch bluefish," Doc Manyshoes said. "Of course, he gets in trouble when he tries to cook 'em. Sometimes he forgets to take the insides out. Then he gets frustrated and has a tantrum. . . ."</p>
        <p>"Funny," Bridget said. "I thought I knew him. But he never told me about his passion for bluefish."</p>
        <p>Doc Manyshoes smiled thinly. "A man has to keep some things to himself. Besides, he was afraid that if the word got out, he'd be stuck with a stupid nickname, like Bluefish Hooker."</p>
        <p>"Where is he?" Juanita said. "What's with this kidnapping?"</p>
        <p>Bridget had been standing a few feet away. She'd always believed in the truth of body language, and Doc's was giving her a strong message. "You know more than you're saying," she accused the doctor. "And you've been here before."</p>
        <p>Doc Manyshoes looked into Bridget's eyes and nodded. "Hooker likes to come here to escape," he said. "Comes here with a case of beer and a book or two. Mysteries, mainly. Nothing too deep. Ocean's only a couple miles away. Hooker feels right at home in Oceanspray, especially in an old waterfront saloon. It serves fresh bluefish, and right out the back there's a fish boat that leaves twice a day. Plenty of times, Hooker makes both trips." Doc hesitated.</p>
        <p>"Trust us," Bridget said.</p>
        <p>"I warned Hooker," Doc went on. "There's always been a smell around that saloon, and I don't mean from the fish. Word is there's gambling in the back room, and the bartenders all take bets. Not only that, but the mob sometimes uses the fishing boats to relocate witnesses."</p>
        <p>"Relocate?" Juanita said.</p>
        <p>"Splash," Doc said. "The Feds have been watching the place for a long time.</p>
        <p>"Anyhow," Doc said, "when Hooker couldn't find the plate the other night, he complained about his chewing tobacco. Thought maybe it had been spiked to throw off his rhythm."</p>
        <p>"Something to slow his reflexes?" Bridget asked.</p>
        <p>"No. Hooker likes to pitch with a couple shots of bourbon in him. Makes him calm, he says. If anyone wanted to ruin him, they'd soak his tobacco in coffee."</p>
        <p>"So what</p>
        <p>really</p>
        <p>happened?" Juanita said. "And where is he now?"</p>
        <p>"My guess," Doc said, "is that the people at the saloon have the answers. They may even have Hooker."</p>
        <p>"Do we call the cops?" Bridget said.</p>
        <p>"No," Doc said. "Cops would just scare everyone off. We'll go there ourselves, right now." He smiled grimly, thinly and shrewdly. "We're not the first people to go to a saloon for answers." Part Five</p>
        <p>"Bluefish put up a hell of a fight," said Juanita. She had turned her back on the sink and was surveying the broken furniture.</p>
        <p>Doc Manyshoes chuckled. "Hooker was probably drunk when he was cleaning it."</p>
        <p>"Hooker doesn't drink the night before he pitches," Bridget said. "His weakness is poker. And come to think of it, he hates fish -- won't eat anything that healthy. He's strictly a beef and french fries guy. What's going on here, Manyshoes? You know where Hooker is, don't you?"</p>
        <p>"I didn't say he liked to eat them -- just that he liked to catch 'em. He was probably making a party for his friends."</p>
        <p>"It doesn't compute, Doc," Juanita said. "Malone was with Belfry here last night. You know where he is. Just a question of letting us in on it."</p>
        <p>Manyshoes' right hand strayed toward his pocket. Almost wearily Juanita pulled the Smith &amp; Wesson from her shoulder bag.</p>
        <p>"Don't try anything, white boy. I'm not in the humor. Besides, I got two hundred riding on Hooker tonight. You don't tell me where he is they'll be fitting you with a prosthesis -- for your head."</p>
        <p>The doctor's face distorted itself in a paroxysm of fury. "You got $200 on the game? I don't want to hear from you and every other goddam Yankee fan in New York. I grew up in Boston. I'm a Red Sox fan. I'll die happy if I know I kept those damned Yankees from winning another World Series."</p>
        <p>Juanita cocked her head at Bridget. "Boy means it."</p>
        <p>"I can't believe it," Bridget said. "All these years the boys have been trusting him, and he's been doing his damnedest to make them lose. . . ."</p>
        <p>"No time for</p>
        <p>Sturm und Drang,</p>
        <p>" Juanita said. "You got anything else to lead you to Malone?"</p>
        <p>Bridget shook her head, trying to think about Hooker, instead of Manny Shulman's cruel betrayal. Suddenly she remembered Franklin Skoyles. He'd been brought in for questioning about the time the cops let her go.</p>
        <p>Juanita nodded at the name. "Two-bit car thief. I know his girlfriend. Babs Salazar. Keep telling her she should stay away from trash like Skoyles. Of course, you ask me, they're mostly all trash. She's a masseuse, but this time of day she'll be at her mom's, changing her oxygen bottle. Old lady has emphysema. You go find her. I'll baby-sit Hippocrates here."</p>
        <p>Bridget set a new speed record on the expressway. Back in the city she jumped lanes and ran red lights with an abandon unusual even in New York, screeching to a halt in front of a five-story building on East 138th. She brushed her way through a handful of jeering teen-agers and pounded on Mrs. Salazar's door.</p>
        <p>It took a while to explain the situation to Babs, to get her to believe Bridget wanted to talk to Skoyles in the hopes of finding Hooker Malone, rather than to frame him for the cops. Once Babs accepted Bridget, though, she wasted more precious time screaming over Doc Manyshoes' perfidy. Bridget finally got Babs to take her to Skoyles.</p>
        <p>They found the car thief shooting pool on East 120th, drinking beer and desperate for good news about Hooker. Babs introduced Bridget.</p>
        <p>"You gotta talk to her, Frankie. Tell her what you know."</p>
        <p>"I don't know nothin'," Skoyles said listlessly. "So it was a fake arm. It fooled me. If I'd known Hooker was O.K. I would have taken the car."</p>
        <p>"But you took a book," Bridget said.</p>
        <p>"Yeah. Only it was stolen from my place this morning. While I was still talking to the Feds. Do they believe me? Of course not."</p>
        <p>"I believe you. You must have looked at the book."</p>
        <p>"Yeah. My favorite book. First edition hard-cover, and some jerk has to go writing on the endpaper."</p>
        <p>"What did it say?" Bridget was scarcely breathing.</p>
        <p>" 'Meet me on the island. Doc.' " Skoyles spat the words out bitterly.</p>
        <p>"So it was Manyshoes' book. He forgot it in Hooker's car and broke into your apartment to get it back!"</p>
        <p>"But where is Hooker?" Babs wailed.</p>
        <p>"I don't know," Bridget said. "But we can try the Doc's place. Maybe we'll find some sign there."</p>
        <p>Manyshoes lived in a self-service apartment in Gramercy Park. Frankie, urged on by Babs, used his special skills to open the doors. They found the Yankee ace in his underwear, chained to a radiator in the kitchen. "Bridget!" Tears ran down his cheeks. "I should've known you'd be on the case."</p>
        <p>"You got a lot of explaining to do, Hooker," Bridget said when Frankie had popped the lock.</p>
        <p>"Let me rub some life back into the boy," Babs said. "He's gotta be ready to start in four hours."</p>
        <p>They trooped into Manyshoes' bedroom. While Babs pummeled the pitcher's shoulders he talked. His gambling losses had been so high this year that he'd sold his condominium, his Ferrari and his Palm Springs winter home. Even so, he still owed half a million. The mob had agreed to overlook the losses -- if he blew the Series.</p>
        <p>"Didn't have to in the first. Rijo just outpitched me. But I stunk so bad in the fourth -- I dunno. I was sure you'd smell a rat, Bridget, knowing me the way you do. I just couldn't do it again tonight. So I told Doc Manyshoes. He staged the fake kidnapping, so I wouldn't have to show up at the park. He used one of the plastic arms he keeps for body mechanics demos. And then when I showed up at the Island he went off his head. We had a big fight, but he stuck me with a needle. When I came to I was here, chained to the radiator. You gotta help me, Bridget."</p>
        <p>"I can do a lot of things," Bridget said, "but taking on the Mob isn't one of them."</p>
        <p>She did what she could, though, getting the Yankee management, the baseball commissioner, the city and the Feds into an emergency meeting. Hooker's ordeal had shaken him so badly he went straight from Manyshoes' apartment to a Gamblers Anonymous meeting. This sign of good faith persuaded the commissioner to allow him to start the seventh game -- on condition he spent the winter in a rehab program. Prosper Gibbons bowed to Yankee front-office pressure and picked up the men who had threatened Hooker.</p>
        <p>By the time Art Huck and the rest of the law reached the shack on the Island where Bridget had left Juanita, they found Manyshoes had shot himself in the head.</p>
        <p>"He knew you'd find the message he'd left in the book," Juanita told Bridget that night over a hot dog in the press box. "He said he couldn't take another bunch of crowing pinstripers."</p>
        <p>He shouldn't have worried. Hooker, drained by his ordeal, gave up five runs in the first. He was pulled before the inning was over, but his teammates couldn't overcome the depression they felt from Manyshoes' betrayal. The final score was 11 to 2, Cincinnati.</p>
