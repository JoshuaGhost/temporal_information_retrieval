        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The hearings before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee concerning Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court were indeed personal tragedies for the two protagonists. These hearings have, however, brought to light the pressures women have lived with in the workplace for generations. Prior to Prof. Anita F. Hill's testimony, our society refused to recognize and address these issues.</p>
        <p>The activities described by Professor Hill are nothing new to women. My mother has often described the efforts of secretaries in the 1920's, who were forced to repel advances of the men for whom they worked. These women would insert straight pins in the shoulders of their clothes with the pins facing upward. Those pins became a powerful disincentive for a boss to place his hand on his secretary's shoulder.</p>
        <p>In recent years studies of gender bias in the courts have been published in New York, New Jersey and my own state of Connecticut. All have found evidence of gender bias in the courts of those states. Sexual harassment is a significant segment of gender bias, which includes other types of prejudicial behavior as well.</p>
        <p>We must learn from this last week, in which our country began to recognize the problems many women face in the workplace. We must not forget what we have learned. We must continue to educate both women and men if we are ever to transcend such tragedies. SUSAN W. WOLFSON  New Haven, Oct. 16, 1991</p>
        <p>The writer is president of the Connecticut Bar Association.</p>
