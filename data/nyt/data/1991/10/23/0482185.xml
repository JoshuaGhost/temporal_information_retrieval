        <p>To bridge a budget gap caused in part by its problems in overbilling the Federal Government for research costs, Stanford University plans to cut $43 million over the next two years by reducing academic and administrative expenses, delaying building projects and scaling back some student financial aid.</p>
        <p>The financial rescue plan, announced yesterday by university officials, sets broad goals for reducing the university's $362 million budget. Administrative expenses would be cut by an average of 13 percent and academic expenses in six of Stanford's schools by an average of 7.6 percent. A Difficult Centennial Year</p>
        <p>To meet these goals, each of the schools must make specific cuts, including possible layoffs of teachers and the elimination or merger of small departments.</p>
        <p>The final package will be submitted to the university's board in April and, if approved, will take effect next in September 1992.</p>
        <p>The budget cuts are the latest in a series of difficulties that Stanford has confronted in this, its centennial year. In July the university's president, Donald Kennedy, announced his resignation after 11 years in office. Mr. Kennedy was at the center of a controversy over accusations by Federal auditors that Stanford had overcharged the Government millions in research-related expenses.</p>
        <p>As a result of the audits and subsequent investigations, Stanford returned more than $1 million to the Government for ineligible research expenses. The Government has also substantially reduced the rate at which Stanford is paid for those research costs, a move that will cost the university more than $20 million and that has added to its deficit.</p>
        <p>Because the department-level cuts have not yet been made, Stanford officials could not estimate how many of the university's 9,000 employees might be laid off.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Faculty Senate, James J. Sheehan, said professors had expressed concern about the effect the announced cuts would have on academic standards.</p>
        <p>"They've told us Stanford's commitment to excellence will not be compromised," said Mr. Sheehan, a professor of history. "The question of whether they honor that will be answered as we move from principled statements to specific application." 8.8% Cut in Education</p>
        <p>The School of Education stands to lose the most among the six schools facing cuts -- 8.8. percent of its operating budget. The Graduate School of Business would get the smallest budget cut, 7.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Besides the academic and administrative cuts, Stanford is delaying a number of construction projects and scaling back repairs to buildings damaged in the 1989 earthquake.</p>
        <p>The university also plans to cut financial aid for students who can afford to pay more. It will do this by including the income of both parents in a divorced family when it calculates the family's ability to pay. The university's offer of financial aid to the student would then be reduced accordingly.</p>
