        <p>Penn Yards Associates, a New York limited partnership and affiliate of Donald J. Trump, has acquired 10 percent of Lifschultz Industries' common stock on a fully diluted basis, Lifschultz said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Penn Yards received the stock in exchange for amending a lease agreement with Lifschultz. The amendment allows Lifschultz to sublet its New York trucking terminal to generate revenue to pay legal costs in Lifschultz's antitrust and RICO lawsuit against Consolidated Freightways, Yellow Freight System and Roadway Express.</p>
        <p>Lifschultz, a scientific instrumentation and real estate concern, sued the three trucking companies in 1987, charging they collaborated with the teamsters' union to force smaller truckers out of business. Lifschultz is seeking $1.8 billion in the suit.</p>
        <p>In a release, Mr. Trump said the Penn Yards stock had been acquired for investment purposes only. He said he had "great confidence in the suit's merits."</p>
        <p>David Lifschultz, the chairman of Lifschultz, said the agreement with Penn Yards allowed Lifschultz to rent the New York terminal for about $11 million over 11 years. Since Lifschultz has tax-loss carry-forwards of $15 million, the rental proceeds will help pay its legal costs, which have reached about $10 million to date, he said.</p>
