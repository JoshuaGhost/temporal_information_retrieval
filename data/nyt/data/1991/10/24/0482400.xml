        <p>On NBC at 9:30 tonight, "Funny Women of Television" could be just another one of those excursions into broadcasting's past via artful clip collages. But it's not. The difference this time can be traced to the 90-minute show's subtitle: "A Museum of Television and Radio Tribute." The standard name dropping is spiked with a sense of perspective about television itself, with an awareness of the medium's ability over decades to absorb and reflect major social and cultural changes. And that can happen even in seemingly dizzy sitcoms.</p>
        <p>Taped before a formally dressed audience in a Los Angeles theater, the proceedings open with Mary Tyler Moore, still clearly capable of turning the world on with a smile, describing the transition from the virtual invisibility of radio, where stars were usually tied to a single character, to the glaringly public showcases of television. Some -- Gracie Allen, Gertrude Berg -- made the leap successfully. Many of the newer performers, though, became "women of many faces": Imogene Coca, Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin, Tracey Ullman. Boundaries were expanded, if not demolished.</p>

        <p>On NBC at 9:30 tonight, "Funny Women of Television" could be just another one of those excursions into broadcasting's past via artful clip collages. But it's not. The difference this time can be traced to the 90-minute show's subtitle: "A Museum of Television and Radio Tribute." The standard name dropping is spiked with a sense of perspective about television itself, with an awareness of the medium's ability over decades to absorb and reflect major social and cultural changes. And that can happen even in seemingly dizzy sitcoms.</p>
        <p>Taped before a formally dressed audience in a Los Angeles theater, the proceedings open with Mary Tyler Moore, still clearly capable of turning the world on with a smile, describing the transition from the virtual invisibility of radio, where stars were usually tied to a single character, to the glaringly public showcases of television. Some -- Gracie Allen, Gertrude Berg -- made the leap successfully. Many of the newer performers, though, became "women of many faces": Imogene Coca, Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin, Tracey Ullman. Boundaries were expanded, if not demolished.</p>
        <p>Serving as host for a segment on the "battle of the sexes," Ms. Tomlin traces the very first sitcom to the Garden of Eden, featuring "a cast of three and a voiceover." Her bag of illustrations includes "The Honeymooners," with Jackie Gleason's Ralph bellowing at Audrey Meadows' Alice: "I'm the boss and you're nothing." "Big deal," counters Alice, "you're the boss over nothing." Looking at depictions of "moms and kids," Betty White gets to include that wonderful moment when Murphy Brown and her mother, played by Candice Bergen and Colleen Dewhurst, attempted with exquisite awkwardness to embrace the way a mother and daughter supposedly should.</p>
        <p>The clips for these thematic tours are well chosen, ranging from "Father Knows Best" and "The Donna Reed Show" to "The Cosby Show," "Roseanne" and "The Simpsons." Perhaps in a bit of quid pro quo maneuvering, the longer clip segments seem to be lavished on the show's hosts, who also include Ms. White, Marlo Thomas, Jasmine Guy, Ms. Burnett, Ms. Ullman and, on tape, Ms. Bergen. In any event, the scope is broad, managing to encompass, along with the laughs, recovering alcoholics, abortion and AIDS.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burnett offers a special tribute to Lucille Ball, describing "one face, one name, one lady who stands out from the crowd." She and Ms. Ball are seen doing a duet of "Up the Lazy River." Ms. Ball is seen alone confiding to a museum seminar her secret about performing comedy: "You have to believe it, no matter how absurd the situation is." Also included is a memorable example of her unflappability when, in an "I Love Lucy" episode with William Holden as guest, her putty nose suddenly goes up in flames.</p>
        <p>This being the Museum of Television and Radio's first outing on a television special, the institution slips in a deserved plug for itself. Mike Wallace toasts "America's newest museum" and provides a brief tour of its handsome new Manhattan building, designed by Philip Johnson. And of course he mentions William S. Paley, founder of CBS, whose determination and largess were crucial in the very existence of the museum.</p>
        <p>As this kind of retrospective packaging gets increasingly popular these days, dipping into everything from the Ed Sullivan show to "60 Minutes," having the museum around as a producer with broader objectives should prove to be of considerable value. Funny Women of Television A Museum of Television and Radio Tribute Directed by Louis J. Horvitz; written by Rhea Kohan and Buz Kohan; produced by Michael B. Seligman; Jack Haley Jr., executive producer. At 9:30 P.M. on NBC. WITH: Mary Tyler Moore, Lily Tomlin, Betty White, Tracey Ullman, Marlo Thomas, Carol Burnett, Candice Bergen, Justine Bateman and Jasmine Guy, hosts.</p>
