        <p>A number of readers have written recently with questions about mutual funds that they already own or are thinking of buying. Here are some of their queries.</p>
        <p>Question: I have been investing in the Value Line Tax-Exempt High-Yield Fund since 1984. I bought shares until mid-1987; after that, I reinvested the interest earned. Even though interest rates are substantially lower today than in the mid-1980's, which means bond prices are higher than they were then, the average price of my shares is less than what I paid. Is this fund a loser?</p>

        <p>A number of readers have written recently with questions about mutual funds that they already own or are thinking of buying. Here are some of their queries.</p>
        <p>Question: I have been investing in the Value Line Tax-Exempt High-Yield Fund since 1984. I bought shares until mid-1987; after that, I reinvested the interest earned. Even though interest rates are substantially lower today than in the mid-1980's, which means bond prices are higher than they were then, the average price of my shares is less than what I paid. Is this fund a loser?</p>
        <p>Answer: On the contrary, this fund has been a decent performer among municipal bond funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. While the share prices now are not much better than your initial purchase prices, the fund has provided you with excellent income over the years.</p>
        <p>It is true that at the time of your letter the fund's shares were selling at less than your average share price. Since then the price has risen to about $10.50, which is still not much higher than the average price of your shares.</p>
        <p>This was caused in part by an odd event in the bond market several years ago: in 1986, Congress considered eliminating municipal bonds' tax-exempt status. This had a dampening effect on your shares not long after your first purchases, and it has taken a long time for the prices to climb back.</p>
        <p>But you seem to be overlooking the fact that the interest paid by this fund over the years has allowed you to buy hundreds of shares you otherwise would not have owned.</p>
        <p>Lipper calculates that the fund has had an annual average total return -- which is defined as principal plus income -- of 10.5 percent for the seven years ended Sept. 30. Of that, the fund's annual increase in principal only was just 1.9 percent. But the fund's yield has been much higher. It exceeded 10 percent in 1985, and it has reached as high as 7.5 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Most bond funds are designed primarily for dividend income, not capital gains. So shareholders should keep in mind that total return and principal-only return for these funds can differ dramatically.</p>
        <p>Q: I have a problem with one of my mutual funds. When I called the fund's portfolio manager and others at the fund group, they were less than helpful. What can I do now?</p>
        <p>A: Take your complaint to the National Association of Securities Dealers. Write a letter describing the problem. Include copies of any documentation like confirmations, correspondence and canceled checks. The letter should be sent to a N.A.S.D. district office, which will forward the complaint to the office that supervises the mutual-fund firm involved. Correspondence to the Manhattan office of the N.A.S.D. should be sent to the Complaint Department, 33 Whitehall Street, New York, N.Y. 10004.</p>
        <p>The N.A.S.D. will acknowledge receipt of your letter. When the investigation is complete, it will inform you of its resolution of the complaint or will recommend that you pursue arbitration. Expect the process to take six weeks or so, said Antoinette Salmon, an N.A.S.D. examiner in New York.</p>
        <p>Q: I am curious whether there are mutual funds that specialize in paper issued by foreign banks. I understand that overseas banks pay considerably higher rates of interest than banks in the United States, and I think that a mutual fund would be a safe way to take advantage of the higher rates, in light of the fact that money market funds are yielding so little today.</p>
        <p>A: Funds that fit your description are called "short-term global income funds" or "short-term multimarket funds" and are one of the hottest fund categories. The first fund was set up in 1989, and now there are about a dozen with roughly $12 billion of assets.</p>
        <p>As you have deduced, these funds try to capture interest rates elsewhere that are higher than rates in the United States. In general, they own international government securities, high-rate corporate paper and certificates of deposit from foreign banks.</p>
        <p>To minimize the risk that the dollar will rise and reduce the value of foreign investments, the funds rely on sophisticated hedging techniques. Even so, the Alliance Short-Term Multi-Market Trust, the $5.7 billion granddaddy of short-term global income funds, has cut dividends as short-term interest rates have fallen, five times in 1991 alone.</p>
        <p>Alliance recently introduced a similar fund, the Alliance World Income Trust, that has an average maturity of one year instead of the three years for the original fund. The result is less risk and a lower yield; its target yield is one percentage point higher than domestic money market funds; the original fund sought a two-point spread.</p>
        <p>For investors who do not want to pay sales charges, the first no-load short-term global income fund, the $827 million Blanchard Short-Term Global Income Fund, was started last January. Scudder now has one as well, and Fidelity Investments recently introduced its own.</p>
        <p>Remember that these funds are not money market funds. While their share prices are relatively stable, they are not fixed at $1. And despite their hedges, the funds' international investments create extra risk.</p>
