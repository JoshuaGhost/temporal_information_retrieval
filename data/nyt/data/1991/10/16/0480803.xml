        <p>The ethnically jumbled republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia today, becoming the fourth of the six units of the old Yugoslav federation to do so since June.</p>
        <p>The president of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegovic, said the declaration of independence and sovereignty was adopted by the Parliament in Sarajevo to prevent his republic from being dragged into the fighting between Serbia and Croatia that in three months has claimed an estimated 2,500 lives. The others to declare independence are Slovenia, Macedonia and Croatia.</p>
        <p>The dominant people of the republic are the 1.91 million Slavic Muslims. But the 1.34 million Serbs and 740,000 Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina have already become involved in the larger conflict as local leaders raise private armies.</p>
        <p>Seventy-three Serbian members of the Parliament marched out when the secession proposal was put to a vote early this morning, calling it an illegal move. Only Slavic Muslim and Croat deputies remained, approving the measure with 133 votes and 15 abstentions.</p>
        <p>President Izetbegovic, meeting today with the federal Defense Minister, Veljko Kadijevic, reportedly reached an agreement that army units in the republic would help Bosnia and Herzegovina's weak police forces to prevent paramilitary formations from taking over Serbian ethnic strongholds.</p>
        <p>In embattled Croatia, however, the army has been fighting shoulder to shoulder with Serbian militia bands.</p>
        <p>The leadership of Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic, under President Slobodan Milosevic, and the leadership of Croatia, the second largest, under President Franjo Tudjman, have both indicated an interest in the past in dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina between them along ethnic lines.</p>
