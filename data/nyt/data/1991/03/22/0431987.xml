        <p>Go-Video Inc. said two defendants in its antitrust case had settled by paying the company $3.5 million. The two defendants that settled were the Sanyo Electric Company and the NEC Corporation, both of Japan.

        <p>Go-Video, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., contends the companies conspired to prevent the development and sale of its patented VCR-2. The machine can play one tape while recording another or can tape two programs simultaneously.</p>
