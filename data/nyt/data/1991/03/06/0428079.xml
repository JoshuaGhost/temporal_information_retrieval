        <p>DEAR Diary:</p>
        <p>The other evening I dined at K. Paul's at Broadway and Bleecker Street, and during dessert I felt an impact on the back of my head. I looked around and noticed a high-heeled black suede pump on the floor. I had been hit in the head with a woman's shoe. Was it something I'd said? Was someone offended by the cut of my jib? A few minutes later, a young man came over to apologize.</p>

        <p>DEAR Diary:</p>
        <p>The other evening I dined at K. Paul's at Broadway and Bleecker Street, and during dessert I felt an impact on the back of my head. I looked around and noticed a high-heeled black suede pump on the floor. I had been hit in the head with a woman's shoe. Was it something I'd said? Was someone offended by the cut of my jib? A few minutes later, a young man came over to apologize.</p>
        <p>"I am Belgian," he said with an accent, "and I was trying to hit the bar." I wondered if all this would make sense if I were Belgian, too. Maybe throwing shoes at the bar is a Belgian custom. He offered to buy me a beer. I politely declined, despite my concern that a refusal violated</p>
        <p>another</p>
        <p>Belgian national custom. -- MARK RITTS HERE COMES MARCH What, again? that sulky month neither winter nor spring like a bad-tempered adolescent girl who, not knowing her own mind cries one day, is hysterical the next, takes up her Cinderella broom of rain, spitefully sweeps hats off our heads, turns umbellas inside out, floods avenues and highways until the wind, losing patience with her antics, pushes her right out of the calendar. -- HANNAH ALEXANDER</p>
        <p>The scene: the post office beneath Rockefeller Center. Dramatis personae: lots of would-be lunch hour stamp buyers in line at the vending machinesnear the entrance. Action: only one of the machines is working and that one erratically, refusing to accept bills that are fed into it.</p>
        <p>On line, Elaine M. Noone sees the woman in front of her point to the counters against the wall. "Oh, look," the woman says, "Let's go to the humans!"</p>
        <p>Conversation overheard by Mari D'Alessandro at a Short Hills, N.J., exercise studio:</p>
        <p>Younger woman:</p>
        <p>And I saw two X-rated movies last night.</p>
        <p>Older woman, surprised:</p>
        <p>You did?</p>
        <p>Younger woman:</p>
        <p>Yes, I was at my girlfriend's baby shower.</p>
        <p>Older woman, even more surprised:</p>
        <p>You mean they showed X-rated movies at a baby shower?</p>
        <p>Younger woman:</p>
        <p>Well, it was her second baby.</p>
        <p>The other morning Alexa Degioannini, a fourth-grade student at Public School 59 on the Upper East Side was traveling to school on a very, very slow bus. The bus took 15 minutes to creep to Fifth Avenue from the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>Certain that she would be late for class, Alexa marched up to the driver. "I'd like a note excusing me for being so late," she said. The bus driver wrote the following note, which is now among the treasured possessions in the teachers' lounge of P.S. 59.</p>
        <p>"Dear Teacher, Your student was on my bus, No. 1662. We were tied up in traffic due to an accident on Fifth Avenue. Please excuse lateness. Bus Driver 1743." Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was on the C train headed downtown. Getting off at 59th Street I bumped into a confused-looking woman. "</p>
        <p>A</p>
        <p>train?" she asked pleadingly in a Spanish accent. "</p>
        <p>A</p>
        <p>train?."</p>
        <p>Correcting her, I anwered quickly:</p>
        <p>"C! C!"</p>
        <p>"</p>
        <p>Gracias,</p>
        <p>" she said, assuming that I had confirmed her inquiry, as the doors slammed shut and the train pulled away.</p>
        <p>I felt lousy the whole day. -- JOE GODFREY Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>The subject is tooth fairies. My friends and I had recently been wondering how much money is dispensed for fallen-out teeth now compared with what we got when we lost ours in the 1960's (one dime per tooth).</p>
        <p>The other afternoon I was in a Madison Avenue coffee shop, and at the table facing me were two Upper East Side mothers and their respective sons, each about 5 years old. They were all eating bagels when Boy 1 announced, "Look, my tooth came out." With that, he proudly held up a bloody tooth. Boy 2, it turned out, had not yet lost any of his baby teeth. He appeared to be impressed.</p>
        <p>"Now you'll have to leave your tooth for the tooth fairy," the mother of Boy 1 told her son.</p>
        <p>"Excuse me," I said eagerly, "but how much is the tooth fairy giving these days?"</p>
        <p>"Two quarters," Boy 1 answered.</p>
        <p>Frankly, I had thought that by now the going rate would be more than that, especially from an Upper East Side tooth fairy. That evening at the theater I related the story to my companion. An older couple next to us were listening intently. Finally, the woman spoke, a trace of pique in her voice.</p>
        <p>"My grandchildren live on Long Island," she said, "and I'll have you know the Lawrence, L.I., tooth fairy gives $2 per tooth."</p>
        <p>I was relieved to learn that in the suburbs, at least, inflation flies high with the tooth fairy. -- VIVIAN AWNER</p>
