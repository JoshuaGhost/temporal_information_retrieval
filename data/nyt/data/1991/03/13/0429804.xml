        <p>There's finally good news about The Daily News of New York. The British media baron Robert Maxwell and the paper's nine striking unions have reached a tentative agreement that clears the way for Mr. Maxwell to buy the paper from The Tribune Company of Chicago.</p>
        <p>If ratified by the unions' rank and file, the agreement means a new lease on life for an institution that, for 71 years, has been a vital part of the city's life.</p>

        <p>There's finally good news about The Daily News of New York. The British media baron Robert Maxwell and the paper's nine striking unions have reached a tentative agreement that clears the way for Mr. Maxwell to buy the paper from The Tribune Company of Chicago.</p>
        <p>If ratified by the unions' rank and file, the agreement means a new lease on life for an institution that, for 71 years, has been a vital part of the city's life.</p>
        <p>That's reason to rejoice. Strikes are always grievous and this one was particularly so. Nearly five months of strife brought hardship and anxiety, corroding relationships, setting friend against friend and straining family resources to the limit.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, the settlement preserves a vigorous voice in an era of fewer and fewer newspapers. And a brash and brassy voice it has been, amusing New Yorkers as it challenged and enlightened them while keeping its competitors honest and alert.</p>
        <p>Daily News reporters applauded Mr. Maxwell this week as he left an all-night bargaining session. The applause was from the heart. During the strike, those reporters expressed over and over the same sentiment that had crossed many New Yorkers' lips: They could not imagine a New York without The Daily News.</p>
        <p>With any luck, they won't have to.</p>
