        <p>Republican leaders, who were on the defensive last summer about taxes, the budget, abortion and other domestic issues, now are gleefully charging Democrats with having been wrong, at best, and unpatriotic, at worst, in opposing the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>That war</p>
        <p>was</p>
        <p>shorter and U.S. casualties were fewer than I, for one, feared they might be. Iraqi resistance was weaker, Arab allies' reliability greater and the American triumph more overwhelming than I expected.</p>
        <p>These misjudgments certainly influenced my opposition, and no doubt that of some Democrats, to President Bush's decision -- narrowly approved by Congress -- to go to war with Iraq in January. But they do</p>
        <p>not</p>
        <p>prove that that opposition was also "wrong"; nor does the desert victory necessarily mean that Mr. Bush chose the better course.</p>
        <p>The world will never know whether the policy he first adopted, and that I and many Americans wholeheartedly supported -- international economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait -- would have worked had it been sustained, as it could have been, for more than a few months. That Mr. Bush decided on war, instead, means that the possible efficacy of the collective economic sanctions never can be determined.</p>
        <p>The war was a success. That does not mean that the other strategy might not have succeeded, over a longer period, but at a lower cost -- in dollars and lives, American as well as Iraqi; or that it might not have left the U.S. in a better long-range position in the Middle East, or at the head of a "new world order," than it is as the military victor over what proved to be a weak opponent.</p>
        <p>Some argue that Saddam Hussein's erratic but determined leadership shows he never would have knuckled under to sanctions; that leaves out of account what else might have happened in the world during six or eight more months of sanctions. It's also argued that those months would have given the Iraqis more time to build up their defenses; in view of the weak resistance actually offered, and the overwhelming coalition power -- not to mention sanctions still at work -- this argument is not persuasive.</p>
        <p>Those who supported the resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to go to war have a right to argue, and they certainly will, that the war's success supported their judgment. Some -- not all -- of them also have the right to say that they judged likely military events more accurately than did others. None of that makes it wrong, and certainly not unpatriotic or cowardly, to have opposed the war.</p>
        <p>The most prominent Democratic victim of his opposition vote, and of current Republican taunting, is Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia -- no longer, as he seemed to be last year, a likely Presidential candidate. Perhaps that was as inevitable as his nay vote is irrecoverable. But do the American people really scorn Senator Nunn's reasoning?</p>
        <p>"I considered my basic philosophy on war and peace," he told Robin Toner of The New York Times, "and that is that you should fight wars only when it's in your vital interest and there's no other reasonable alternative. And I felt then that there was a reasonable alternative, and I still feel there was a reasonable alternative.  . . . I've also had the position, and nothing about this conflict is going to change it, that war is a last resort."</p>
        <p>Another Democrat who voted against war in January was Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the chairman of a subcommittee on Mideast affairs. In an article for The Washington Post, Mr. Hamilton made two points that may be of increasing importance as time goes on:</p>
        <p>"How do you calculate the cost" not only of Americans killed and wounded, but of an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Iraqi casualties? "How do you estimate the cost of reconstructing devastated cities? How do you measure the cost of environmental damage to the air and waters of the Persian Gulf and the cost of destroyed oil wells and facilities? Were we wrong to support a policy that might have spared these lives and that damage?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton pointed out, moreover, what Secretary of State Baker may have learned on his Middle East trip -- that "every tough issue on the Middle East agenda remains ahead of us after this war. . . . our military success will be of little lasting value if we do not fare well with postwar political and economic challenges."</p>
        <p>There's no doubt who won the war, and who gained the most politically by the victory. But those inclined to deride the political losers might yet have cause to regret their intemperance. As an old Semblan proverb has it, the wise at nightfall praise the day.</p>
