        <p>When her son needed a new shirt, Zoya Begovaya moved up the cuffs on an old shirt of her husband. When she couldn't find sponges in the store, she knotted together old stockings to scrub her dishes. And when the price of newspapers tripled at the beginning of the year, she and her neighbors decided to share a subscription.</p>
        <p>She is not poor and she is not starving, but like most Soviet citizens Mrs. Begovaya is forced by shortage and cost to patch, preserve and swap to run her household. Nothing Is Beyond Use</p>
        <p>"I tell my husband that I am a human bird, building my nest by scavenging," she said, a cracked laugh belying frustration in a country where squirreling things away for future use is not an eccentricity, but a way of life.</p>
        <p>These days it seems as if nothing here is beyond use by somebody, not the empty cartons of milk that is itself in appallingly short supply in the city ("We use them to plant tomatoes on our windowsill," said Aleksandra Kaminskaya, a teacher. "You can't buy pots for planting anywhere in the city and we can't afford to buy tomatoes at the market"), not torn stockings (they are also used as stuffing for pillows), not even the sickly fish that survive the murky, polluted waters of the Moscow River ("This is for dinner, not for sport," said one sad old man, his pole bowing over a midtown bridge).</p>
        <p>A Government plan to raise prices ateeply, long awaited and scheduled to go into effect on April 2, has only intensified fear among many people here that they will be able to afford less and less in the stores and will have to rely even more on stretching the lives of things they already own.</p>
        <p>Here, recycling is not the moral playing ground of environmentalists; it is a daily game of practicality played by just about everybody.</p>
        <p>"To me, it is very sad that this is what our rich country has come to," said Oleg Kalugin, who was using an old, bald tire to patch a flat on his truck, broken down in the middle of Moscow's main ring road. "And if we here in Moscow are saving every rag and every scrap, imagine what people must be doing out in the provinces." From Garbage to Jewelry</p>
        <p>But there is as much to admire as to mourn in the resourceful reuse of life's debris. For where else but in a place of want would an empty matchbox and a colorful page from a magazine rise from the status of garbage to become a gift box for jewelry?</p>
        <p>At times it seems as if the whole society operates like a clever kindergarden arts and crafts teacher, secreting away buttons, bottles and empty toilet paper rolls for use in some as yet undetermined real-life collage.</p>
        <p>"Whenever we finish using anything -- whether it's a can of food or a piece of clothing or even a newspaper -- we always look at it twice and think if there's any way we can reuse what's left over," said Georgi Gankin, who was waiting in a midday line for milk.</p>
        <p>When it is available, milk sometimes is sold in quart-size plastic bags. Mr. Gankin's wife, like many other Moscow housewives, carefully slices them open, pours the milk into a pitcher, washes out the bags and uses them for wrapping sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Aware of its own shortages, the Government supports some recycling programs. There are centers around the city where people can turn in their bottles and jars for cash and their paper goods and rags for coupons that can be used to buy items that are hard to find in regular stores.</p>
        <p>The glass is sent back to the factories and used again and the paper is recycled or sold abroad for hard currency. 'I Have No Choice'</p>
        <p>"It's better to run around with these bottles than to sit around like an old hen," said Anna Yakimtsova, 90 years old, who lugged some dozen jars and bottles to a Moscow recycling center.</p>
        <p>The four rubles and 50 kopecks she collected will help stretch the 80-ruble pension she gets after decades spent working as a charwoman. But she fears the impending price rises will imperil her already precarious budget.</p>
        <p>"I save everything," she said, wrapping her precious refund in a kerchief and burying it under layers of aprons and sweaters. "I have no choice."</p>
        <p>The garbage bins of the many foreigners living in Moscow are rich fields for Muscovites looking for empty bottles and paper goods to turn in. Most Westerners living here do not need the shoes or toasters for which the paper recycling coupons can be redeemed, and so they carelessly throw out old magazines, newspapers, and milk and juice cartons (which can be split open, neatly trimmed and turned in).</p>
        <p>And amid the waste, there are often remarkably useful finds. The empty plastic, lidded boxes from disposable baby diaper wipes are grabbed up for storing just about anything, as are baby food jars and plastic mineral water bottles. Such items are often saved in the West, but they become even more valuable in a country where you cannot buy storage containers and often need a jar or a bottle to buy beverages, sour cream and other foods.  For Survival's Sake</p>
        <p>A Russian woman who works as a nanny for Americans collects the family's jars, bottles and boxes. What she does not use herself, she distributes among needy neighbors -- baby food jars to the woman who makes honey to sell at the market, water bottles to the elderly couple who sell homemade sunflower oil.</p>
        <p>At the Tishinsky Market in central Moscow the desperate need to find new uses for that which is old and worn is pitiful. At first glance, it seems as if no one could be more pathetic than the haggard, rag-clothed man selling one bent, rusted fork, until another, more ragged man comes along and buys it.</p>
        <p>As the supply situation for most goods has worsened, a certain sense of camaraderie has begun to take root here. Without being asked by the authorities to do so, people have been spontaneously taking old medicine bottles to their local pharmacies to service the next round of patients, responding to Government claims that one of the reasons for the dire medicine shortage here is a lack of proper containers.</p>
        <p>"We don't have the luxury of recycling for the lofty, moral sake of saving the environment," said Natalya Polupanova, deputy director of a bottle recycling center in Moscow. "We recycle and save for the very practical sake of survival."</p>
