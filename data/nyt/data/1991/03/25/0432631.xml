        <p>THE latest addition to Michael Jordan's burgeoning business empire is the McJordan sandwich, a quarter-pound hamburger -- topped with smoked bacon, cheese, barbecue sauce, onions, mustard and pickles -- that recently made its debut at McDonald's franchises in the Chicago area. "What do you want me to say, 'It's bad, don't eat it?' " Jordan said with a smile. . . . Speaking of fast food -- and he often does -- George Foreman, busy training, took time out the other day to return a reporter's phone call. The rotund former champion, who fights Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight title on April 19, was speaking from his car phone. "I've got to do this other call," he said, then was overhead saying, "Get me a cheeseburger, pickles, ketchup. Tell him no mayo." At least he held the mayo, after all he is in training. . . . Jimmy Connors, at 38 on the road back from wrist surgery, stopped off at the Newsweek Champions Cup last month to play pros for $5 a game. In three days, he reportedly took $50 off Andrew Sznajder, $45 off Thomas Muster, and $10 each off Goren Ivanisevic and Henri Leconte. Connors was taking his cue from Bobby Riggs, who maintains there is no better way to get your game in shape than to play for your own money.</p>
