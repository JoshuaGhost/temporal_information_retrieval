        <p>Like crocuses, mutual fund advertisements -- coaxing investors to open individual retirement accounts before April 15 -- are harbingers of spring. So far, they have succeeded: Mutual funds had captured almost a quarter of the $465.4 billion I.R.A. market at the end of 1989, the most recent totals from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. That's a bigger chunk than the I.R.A. money invested through banks, savings institutions, life insurance companies, credit unions or brokerage firms, which also offer the tax-deferring I.R.A.'s.</p>
        <p>So far during this tax season, mutual fund companies say, new accounts are down, probably because of the Mideast conflict. But they believe that sales will pick up before April 15 as tax time draws nearer and a market rally, driven by apparent war success, takes hold.</p>

        <p>Like crocuses, mutual fund advertisements -- coaxing investors to open individual retirement accounts before April 15 -- are harbingers of spring. So far, they have succeeded: Mutual funds had captured almost a quarter of the $465.4 billion I.R.A. market at the end of 1989, the most recent totals from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. That's a bigger chunk than the I.R.A. money invested through banks, savings institutions, life insurance companies, credit unions or brokerage firms, which also offer the tax-deferring I.R.A.'s.</p>
        <p>So far during this tax season, mutual fund companies say, new accounts are down, probably because of the Mideast conflict. But they believe that sales will pick up before April 15 as tax time draws nearer and a market rally, driven by apparent war success, takes hold.</p>
        <p>Given that, how should people invest their I.R.A. funds? Most investment advisers recommend putting a big chunk of retirement savings into stock funds, which outperform fixed-rate investments over time. But it makes sense to move into stocks slowly to limit losses in case the market slips. Put cash into a money fund and then buy shares in stock funds at regular intervals.</p>
        <p>The following are questions investors are asking Oppenheimer, one of the big fund groups, and answers from Sam Freedman, president of Oppenheimer Shareholder Services; Robert M. Fields, an attorney with the New York law firm of Spengler Carlson Gubar Brodsky &amp; Frischling, and Lewis J. Altfest, a New York investment adviser.</p>
        <p>Question: How much can I contribute to an I.R.A.?</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman: Anyone younger than 70 1/2 can contribute up to $2,000 of earned income each year -- or $2,250, if your spouse doesn't work. But you lose part of the tax deduction for the contribution if you participate in your employer's 401 (k) or another retirement plan (or if your spouse does, if you file jointly) and your adjusted gross income rises from $40,000 to $50,000 for married couples filing joint tax returns (for singles, the equivalent is $25,000 to $35,000). When you earn more than that, you lose the deduction entirely.</p>
        <p>Q. Is it worthwhile to contribute to an I.R.A. if I can't deduct the contribution?</p>
        <p>Mr. Altfest: I urge clients to set aside the maximum amounts in pension and 401 (k) plans but I'm less enthusiastic about I.R.A.'s.</p>
        <p>They make sense for people who lack the discipline to save. They are also good bets for active traders, because the I.R.A. shields trading profits from the capital gains tax.</p>
        <p>But for everyone else, the sole advantage is that earnings in the account build up tax-free until the money is withdrawn. But you can get that elsewhere. Let's say you put $2,000 into an I.R.A. every year for 20 years and the account earns 10 percent annually. You end up with $126,005, or $86,943 after Federal tax is paid at the 31 percent rate. But if you invest the same amount of money in municipal bond funds earning 7 percent, you would have slightly more, $87,730.</p>
        <p>The longer you leave the money in the I.R.A., the more valuable the tax deferral.  You can also come out ahead with the I.R.A. if you pay tax at a lower rate at retirement.</p>
        <p>One warning: When you withdraw money, you will need records to show which contributions were deductible and which were not. Keep copies of Form 8606, filed with your tax return. To make record-keeping easier, Oppenheimer, for one, will segregate nondeductible contributions in a separate I.R.A.</p>
        <p>Q. How can I move my existing I.R.A. account into a mutual fund?</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman: The easiest way is called a "trustee-to-trustee" transfer. You complete an I.R.A. application and a "Change of Trustee" form, which authorizes the mutual fund group to take the money from your old I.R.A.  Unlike an I.R.A. rollover, this transfer does not have to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service by the fund or by the investor.</p>
        <p>Q. When must I begin withdrawing money from the I.R.A.?</p>
        <p>Mr. Fields: You can start withdrawing the money without penalty when you turn 59 1/2. If you don't, you must begin taking out a minimum amount based on I.R.S. tables by April 1 of the year following the year that you turn 70 1/2. You have to take another minimum distribution by Dec. 31 of that year; after that, one annual withdrawal is required.</p>
        <p>Some fund groups will calculate the minimum required amount and then mail you checks on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.</p>
        <p>Q. How much will it cost to set up an I.R.A.?</p>
        <p>Mr. Fields: Some funds charge a small fee, around $10. After that, you should expect to pay a yearly fee of about $10 or $15. The fees come under the heading of "miscellaneous expenses," which when toted up can be deducted to the extent that the total exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income. To claim the deduction, you must write separate checks for the I.R.A. contribution and expenses.</p>
