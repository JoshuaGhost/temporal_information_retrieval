        <p>To the Editor: A couple of points about Gorizia ("A Not-Very-Divided City" by Paul Hofmann, Travel, Dec. 16): The castle is not a ruin, it is complete and in good order down to the furniture. Several years ago I saw an excellent show of Venetian paintings, Canaletto, Titian, etc., at the castle and had a terrific lunch at Lanterna d'Oro next to the castle.</p>
        <p>The Verdi Theater was a movie house in 1946 (the United States Army was using it), and the cafe at the corner was an American snack bar. The Corso Italia was officially known as the Viale Roosevelt.</p>

        <p>There was a sculptor's studio in Mossa across the Isonzo River that was filled with Roman artifacts brought in by local farmers. JAMES E. OWENS Eastham, Mass. Paul Hofmann replies: The medieval castle has been rebuilt over the centuries by the Venetians, the Austrians and the Italians. It is partly restored and partly in ruins. Recently the restaurant Lanterna d'Oro was also being redone, and the Verdi Theater remains a motion picture theater. As for the Corso Italia, it is no longer called the Viale Roosevelt.</p>
