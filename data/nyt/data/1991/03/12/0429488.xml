        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency threatened today to withhold more than $12 million in Federal cleanup money from North Carolina if it did not develop a plan to dispose of hazardous waste. If the threat is carried out, it will be the first use of harsh Federal sanctions against a state for failing to develop such a plan.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Gov. James G. Martin of North Carolina, the E.P.A. Administrator, William K. Reilly, said the state had not met crucial timetables over the last two years. State proposals to build waste disposal sites have been defeated by local opposition, and North Carolina has been sending its waste to South Carolina and Alabama. But those states complain that North Carolina's lack of a disposal plan is an unfair burden on them.</p>

        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency threatened today to withhold more than $12 million in Federal cleanup money from North Carolina if it did not develop a plan to dispose of hazardous waste. If the threat is carried out, it will be the first use of harsh Federal sanctions against a state for failing to develop such a plan.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Gov. James G. Martin of North Carolina, the E.P.A. Administrator, William K. Reilly, said the state had not met crucial timetables over the last two years. State proposals to build waste disposal sites have been defeated by local opposition, and North Carolina has been sending its waste to South Carolina and Alabama. But those states complain that North Carolina's lack of a disposal plan is an unfair burden on them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly gave the state 60 days to come up with a new plan or lose the Federal cleanup money. In a telephone interview, he said the action was the first the agency had taken since the Federal hazardous waste law was amended in 1989 to require states to develop 20-year disposal plans.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government has approved 44 state plans for disposing of hazardous wastes, defined in the law as toxic, corrosive, unstable or highly flammable products of industrial processes. Mr. Reilly said five other states were well on their way to developing such plans. Most state plans involve a combination of disposal or storage within their borders and shipment to disposal sites in other states.</p>
        <p>"The clock is now running for North Carolina," Mr. Reilly said, adding that he was still not sure that the Federal sanctions would solve the problem.</p>
        <p>"I don't expect that the threat will change the minds of those opposed to disposal sites in the state," he said.</p>
        <p>Linda Little, executive director of North Carolina's Waste Management Board, said the state had been expecting such an action but was not sure what to do next. She said the Governor had repeatedly submitted disposal plans only to have them rejected by the Legislature or local communities.</p>
        <p>"We have pulled all of the rabbits we have out of our magician's hat," she said, "and I am not sure what we will be able to do."</p>
