        <p>The dollar slipped against most foreign currencies yesterday, but rose against the German mark amid perceptions of continued weakness in the German economy.</p>
        <p>The United States currency opened higher, following a surge overseas. But it lost ground as leading currencies posted higher gains against the mark, which has been hurt by signs of growing economic weakness in Germany.</p>
        <p>The dollar closed slightly below 1.7000 marks -- the American currency's highest level against the mark in nearly a year.</p>
        <p>"There was a lot of music," said James Maccario, vice president in foreign exchange at Shawmut Bank of Boston. "I don't know if a lot of people were dancing."</p>
        <p>That the dollar did not gain more was attributed in part to a movement of investments into the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, whose strong performances stole some of the spotlight from the dollar.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Maccario said, "the market has been messy for the past weak or so, which tends to take people out."</p>
        <p>Dollar buyers were encouraged by two economic releases yesterday that raised hopes for a swift economic recovery. The Commerce Department reported that factory orders edged down three-tenths of a percent in February. It was the third decline in the last four months, but not as great as the expected 1 percent drop.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 81 in March from 59.4 in February. It was the largest single month-to-month gain in the 24-year history of the survey.</p>
        <p>In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 138.50 yen, up from 137.90 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it closed at 138.35 yen. In New York trading, the dollar closed at 138.80 yen, down from late Monday's 139.20 yen.</p>
        <p>In London, the pound fell to $1.7545, from $1.7635 late Monday. But the pound gained in New York, closing at $1.7580, more expensive than the $1.7477 of late Monday.</p>
        <p>Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.6870 marks, up from 1.6865; 1.4330 Swiss francs, down from 1.4370; 5.7240 French francs, down from 5.7265; 1,253.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1602 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1618.</p>
        <p>Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.6900 marks, up from 1.6710; 1.4350 Swiss francs, up from 1.4285; 5.7370 French francs, up from 5.6740; 1.9055 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8830; 1,255.25 Italian lire, up from 1,241.75, and 1.1598 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1603.</p>
