        <p>It's spring! Well, almost, and besides, it's the feeling that counts. After all, if it's St. Patrick's Day, there's not long to wait. And in the meantime the long, decorated leg is getting second looks on New York streets. Tights flash images from the Pop Art canvases of Andy Warhol. The most striking are multiple prints of Marilyn Monroe. At a recent SoHo art show opening, multiple television images ran down one woman's legs as she stopped at a Kenny Scharf canvas that consisted of multiple head images echoing the pattern of her tights. All along Fifth Avenue, black and white stripes, diamond and check patterns are worn with short skirts. Even tights in solid colors have raised patterns like herringbone and cable-knit. Stretch velour tights have a corduroy-like surface. Some patterned tights are worn with long jackets and sweaters, a look that is distinctly spring 1990.</p>
