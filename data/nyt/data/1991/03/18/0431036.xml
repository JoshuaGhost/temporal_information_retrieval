        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While the basic point of "In U.S. Technology, a Gap Between Arms and VCR's" (front page, March 4) may be valid, Raytheon Corporation's major appliance business was a poor example to choose.</p>
        <p>The United States major appliances industry is an example of successful international competitiveness. Of the 46 million washers, dryers, refrigerators and other major appliances marketed annually in the United States only 17 percent are imports. Why? Because producers such as Raytheon's appliance group have kept quality up and prices down, while advancing innovation. There has been no niche left for the Japanese and others to exploit.</p>
        <p>A recent article in Productions magazine observed that a 14-cubic-foot General Electric refrigerator sold for $525 in 1927. Adjusted for inflation, that refrigerator would cost $8,100 today. Yet, a 16-cubic-foot G.E. refrigerator can be purchased today for $499.</p>
        <p>United States defense spending may contribute to a poor competitive posture in some of our industries, but the major appliance industry is not one of them. ROBERT L. HOLDING  President, Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers Chicago, March 4, 1991</p>
