        <p>Pete Weber's fate was in his hands today at the $150,000 Johnny Petraglia Open, and after throwing a strike and a nine on his first two balls in the 10th frame, those hands were raised in triumph.</p>
        <p>Last week, Weber and a national television audience, watched in disbelief as Del Ballard Jr., who needed seven pins to win the Fair Lanes Open in Baltimore, rolled a gutter ball in the 10th frame to give Weber a gift victory. "I love it," said Weber,of Florissant, Mo., holding up a crystal trophy with a check for $27,000 folded inside. "I wasn't sitting on the bench this time. I won it outright."</p>

        <p>Weber, whose open fourth frame put him 15 pins behind Bob Benoit of Topeka, Kan., in the championship match, rallied with six consecutive strikes and pulled away for a 244-234 victory. Needing five pins to clinch the match on his second ball in the 10th frame, Weber eschewed his usual sweeping hook shot and threw a straight ball, knocking down nine pins.</p>
        <p>In a similar situation last week, Ballard went for a strike, and came up empty.</p>
