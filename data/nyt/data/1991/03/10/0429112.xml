        <p>At long last, the time may be right for the music of Ferruccio Busoni to reach a wider public. For nearly a century it has languished, not entirely forgotten due to a few loving champions, but dismissed by received opinion. Now that stylistic diversity has become newly popular, Busoni's own variety and contradictions are seen less as a liability than as a prescient virtue.</p>
        <p>Busoni (1866-1924) was a proud Romantic piano virtuoso who as a composer espoused what he called "young Classicism," a return to the formalist values of the 18th century after a surfeit of Romantic excess. He played Bach, albeit in his own grandly inflated transcriptions, and carried on (as person, pianist and composer) like the reincarnation of Liszt. A true cosmopolitan, almost stateless despite his Italian birth, he lived most of his mature life in Germany and imbibed all the muddy philosophical values of that country.</p>

        <p>At long last, the time may be right for the music of Ferruccio Busoni to reach a wider public. For nearly a century it has languished, not entirely forgotten due to a few loving champions, but dismissed by received opinion. Now that stylistic diversity has become newly popular, Busoni's own variety and contradictions are seen less as a liability than as a prescient virtue.</p>
        <p>Busoni (1866-1924) was a proud Romantic piano virtuoso who as a composer espoused what he called "young Classicism," a return to the formalist values of the 18th century after a surfeit of Romantic excess. He played Bach, albeit in his own grandly inflated transcriptions, and carried on (as person, pianist and composer) like the reincarnation of Liszt. A true cosmopolitan, almost stateless despite his Italian birth, he lived most of his mature life in Germany and imbibed all the muddy philosophical values of that country.</p>
        <p>No work of Busoni's better illustrates those contradictions -- and shows how he could make meaningful music of them -- than his vast Piano Concerto (Op. 39). First performed in Berlin in 1904, with the composer as soloist and Karl Muck conducting, the score takes more than 70 minutes to perform, contains five movements and enlists not only a huge orchestra but also a male chorus. It was dismissed in 1904 as gargantuan and chaotic by Busoni's many enemies ("Noise, more noise, eccentricity and licentiousness provoked yet more noise," wrote the Tagliche Rundschau, a Berlin newspaper) and was regarded with suspicion even by his friends.</p>
        <p>The modernist critic H. H. Stuckenschmidt, who cared enough about Busoni to devote an entire book to him, worried that "the unity of the style is jeopardized by the desire to combine altogether too many different forms, styles and artistic attitudes, and to build them into something monumental. There is a hint of gigantomania in this score, an almost Kaiser Wilhelm-like, modern German tendency towards overstatement." Alfred Brendel, that archetypally modernist pianist, complained more succinctly that the concerto was "monstrously overcomposed."</p>
        <p>In 1967, the same year that Stuckenschmidt's book appeared, the English pianist John Ogdon and the Royal Philharmonic conducted by Daniell Revenaugh made the first recording of the concerto, a performance that has been reissued in a fine-sounding CD transfer on the midprice EMI Studio label (CDM 7 69850 2). In 1968, a performance by two little-known West Germans -- Volker Banfield as soloist with Lutz Herbig conducting the Bavarian Radio Symphony -- appeared on the C.P.O. label (999 017-2). Telarc recorded the score in 1989 with Garrick Ohlsson, Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra (CD-80207). Now the English and EMI have completed the circle with the release of a live 1988 London Proms performance with Peter Donohoe as soloist and Mark Elder conducting the BBC Symphony (Angel CDC 7 49996 2).</p>
        <p>All this interest reflects a new recognition of the ever more audible virtues of the work, a sort of concerto equivalent of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the many choral symphonies it inspired, culminating in those of Mahler. What seemed like chaotic stylistic indecision to modernists appears as rich diversity to postmodernists. Stuckenschmidt properly noted parallels between Mahler and Busoni. But whereas by 1967 modernists had come to accept Mahler's dizzying range, only now are we beginning to find similar strengths in Busoni's eclecticism.</p>
        <p>Busoni was ambivalent about explanatory program descriptions, fitfully espousing musical abstraction. But the concerto does seem to build to mystical affirmations from its first to its third to its fifth movement, the last a "Hymn to Allah" based on incidental music Busoni was planning for a Danish play called "Aladdin." In between, in the second and fourth movements, comes more Mediterranean fare, a Scherzo and a Tarantella, which still manage to sound cosmically Teutonic. Busoni depicted this scheme graphically in an illustration on the title page of the score, with its temples, Egyptology, rising sun, erupting volcano and Art Nouveau evocations of nature.</p>
        <p>All four recordings of this wildly diverse score have their virtues, and each illuminates a different facet of Busoni's intentions. The new Donohoe-Elder interpretation is the most richly recorded and comes closest to Busoni's world-embracing orchestral vision. From the wonderfully ruminative Brahmsian opening to the final transcendence, this is the best statement of the work as a kind of late Romantic restatement of Mozart's "Zauberflote." Mr. Donohoe and Mr. Elder also sweep from movement to movement without pause, making the concerto even more of a unified Lisztian statement than it might otherwise appear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohoe plays fervently and excitingly, but the recorded balance makes him less prominent than in most concerto recordings. It echoes the description of the composer's English biographer, Edward J. Dent: "Busoni sits at the pianoforte, listens, comments, decorates and dreams."</p>
        <p>The Ohlsson-Dohnanyi version is the preferred choice for those who want to hear the solo part played with thrilling virtuosity. The piano is front and center, rich and solid, while the orchestra sounds curiously fragmented -- multimiking at its most artificial. The Banfield-Herbig disk is the least competitive but has its interesting aspects, capturing a delightful (if not necessarily appropriate) Mendelssohnian lightness. Finally, the pioneering Ogdon-Revenaugh version is the most passionately intense overall statement of a score that is peppered with indications like "con audacia" and "con frenesia," and it still holds up sonically.</p>
        <p>At least three of these CD's, then, are well worth hearing. And their very presence attests to an interest in a composer whose entry into the pantheon was delayed a century by a recalcitrant Zeitgeist.</p>
