        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I was puzzled by "The Eternal Race Between Man and Woman" (The Times, Jan. 21). One of the articles was written by a man, the other by a woman, and they both expressed resentment by men who were outrun by women. Why?</p>
        <p>Over the years, hundreds, if not thousands, of women have outrun me and I'm proud of them. Because first and foremost they are runners. I'm active with the New York Road Runners Club and am around runners a great deal. I assure you, the prevailing attitude is that you're either a runner or you're not. What sex you are is meaningless.</p>
        <p>Just ask any man who has turned a personal best while finishing behind Greta Weitz. DON ROSS  New York</p>
