        <p>John L. Hanson, vice president of human resources at the Parker Hannifin Corporation, recently gave copies of "Keeping the Best," Martin Yate's book on motivating employees, to about 40 of the industrial component manufacturer's managers. "The book says that the first step in satisfying customers is having satisfied employees, and I want to drive that point home," he said.</p>
        <p>Ricardo C. Calvillo, president of the New York advertising agency Calet, Hirsch and Spector, gave a dozen of his top people copies of Peter M. Senge's "The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization" because he thought it offered well-reasoned views on operating in a tough business environment.</p>
        <p>"I'm tired of '10 quick solutions' magazine articles, or seminars based on bromides," said Mr. Calvillo. Indeed, he is currently looking for other books to distribute. "Today's times cry out for the kind of profound ideas that need an entire volume to explore," he said.</p>
        <p>Educators who bemoan the declining popularity of books, accompanied by the rise of sound bites and short printed takes, can take heart. There is at least one arena where the bound volume is having a renaissance: the work place.</p>
        <p>"Five, seven years ago we sold virtually nothing to corporations," said Bob Adams, who owns Bob Adams Inc., a publisher of business books -- including "Keeping the Best" -- in Holbrook, Mass. "Last year we sold $110,000 worth to companies -- and I'll bet a lot of our bookstore sales were to companies, too," he said.</p>
        <p>Don't bet against him. No one has hard numbers -- bookstores do not track who buys books, or for what use -- but publishers say informal feedback from stores and from regional offices indicates that multiple-copy sales to companies are making up an increasing percentage of the sales of business books.</p>
        <p>"There's no question, more of our sales are to corporations, for their employees," said James Picard, an account manager for Great Performance Inc., a Portland, Ore., publisher of books on stress management. "More and more of our books are being bought in bulk."</p>
        <p>There are many reasons for the current flurry of corporate book-giving. American companies, desperate for better ways to compete globally, are seeking the proper balance between entrepreneurial spirit and team playing, between motivating and coddling, between hard work and workaholism, between centralized planning and decentralized decision-making.</p>
        <p>In the old and fatter days, they might have sent people en masse to weeklong seminars on any of those subjects. But few managers in the modern pared-down corporation can afford the time or money.</p>
        <p>"Companies are wising up to the fact that books provide very important training for the lowest possible cost per employee," said Jeremy P. Tarcher, editor in chief of Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., a Los Angeles publisher that is enjoying brisk corporate sales of "Working from Home," a book by Paul and Sarah Edwards on telecommuting.</p>
        <p>There are less mercenary reasons, too, of course. Some companies give books -- particularly ones on fitness, stress management and other ways of improving employees' lives -- as morale boosters and signs that management cares. Furthermore, the how-to gift book fits nicely into the pan-societal trend toward self-service and self-help in an era demanding more of each worker.</p>
        <p>And, publishers are simply making business books more available.</p>
        <p>In August, the Professional Book Group at McGraw-Hill Inc. appointed three people whose sole duty is to sell books to corporations. The company's title list, which is heavily weighted toward reference and training books, is including more books that "help individuals do their job," said Elizabeth L. Crawford, director of special sales. One example: "How to Present Like a Pro," a book on communications by Lani Arrendondo that McGraw-Hill is marketing to human resources people.</p>
        <p>As a marketing strategy, Bob Adams sent copies of "Keeping the Best" to the chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. "When a chief executive passes a book along to the human resources department, they are a lot more likely to order it in bulk," he said. About 1,000 of the 30,000 copies the book has sold since it came out in November were multiple-copy sales to corporations.</p>
        <p>For some companies, book buying comes in waves. When the MCI Communications Corporation began seriously to erode the monopoly held by American Telephone and Telegraph on long-distance service in the mid-1970's, and again, when A.T.&amp;T. was broken up several years later, numerous books circulated through the company, recalled Burke Stinson, an A.T.&amp;T. public relations manager. "Anxiety levels were so high that managers bought everything from how-to marketing books to 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,' " he said.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp;.T. recently bought 20,000 copies of "Working from Home" as gifts for people who provided the company with work-at-home tips which it then printed in its customer newsletter. But, a growing number of A.T.&amp;T. people are starting to work from home, too. "I suspect we'll send copies to our own people soon," Mr. Stinson said. READING INTO THE READING LIST</p>
        <p>It might seem that giving books to employees is all upside potential, no downside risk. Not true.</p>
        <p>Some employees resent having philosophies shoved down their throats. Burke Stinson of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company had "mind control freaks who want everyone on their teams to think like they do" give him "gifts" of books that he then felt forced to read.</p>
        <p>"In my mind, a smart, enlightened manager is one who would tell me about a book and then leave me the option of whether to get it," he said.</p>
        <p>Distributing books to selected employees can make those who did not receive them feel slighted. "When the boss gave a copy of 'In Search of Excellence' to one of my colleagues and not to me, I started looking for a job," said one New York executive, who insisted on remaining anonymous.</p>
        <p>Conversely, buying enough books for everyone can be tantamount to a product endorsement. That's one reason why executives at the International Business Machines Corporation rarely buy books for their employees.</p>
        <p>"The culture here makes people skittish about even appearing to endorse anything," said Mac Jeffery, an I.B.M. spokesman.</p>
