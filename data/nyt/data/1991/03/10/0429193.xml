        <p>Kenya's President, Daniel arap Moi, has craftily exploited the world's preoccupation with Iraq to settle scores with citizens guilty of no greater crime than criticizing the Government. He has been engaged for weeks in a crackdown on critics of the one-party autocracy he instituted in 1982.</p>
        <p>His latest victim is Gitobu Imanyara, editor of the widely respected Nairobi Law Monthly. After security police confiscated the current issue of his journal -- it contained an article about the formation of an opposition political party -- Mr. Imanyara was arrested at his office without charges. He was unable to notify his family or lawyer, and his papers were ransacked without a search warrant. This followed previously unsuccessful attempts by President Moi to silence Mr. Imanyara with harassing legal actions.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in Africa, authoritarian regimes are relaxing indefensible constraints on free expression. President Moi is moving, self-destructively, against the advancing tide.</p>
