        <p>The Fluor Corporation said today that its quarterly earnings fell 9 percent as lower profits from its lead-producing operations more than offset better results in its core engineering and construction business.</p>
        <p>Fluor earned $25.8 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion for the three months that ended on Jan. 31, its first quarter. That compared with earnings of $28.2 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $1.9 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>

        <p>The Fluor Corporation said today that its quarterly earnings fell 9 percent as lower profits from its lead-producing operations more than offset better results in its core engineering and construction business.</p>
        <p>Fluor earned $25.8 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion for the three months that ended on Jan. 31, its first quarter. That compared with earnings of $28.2 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $1.9 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Fluor, the country's largest engineering and construction company, has a long history of work in the Middle East. It is expected to win big contracts to help rebuild Kuwait. Last year, it received a multibillion-dollar contract to oversee the near-doubling of Saudi oil production capacity.</p>
        <p>Its backlog of work grew by 11 percent, to $9.7 billion, from $8.7 billion a year earlier.</p>
        <p>"The prospect list for new engineering and construction awards remains very strong across many industries and geographic markets," said Les McCraw, Fluor's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Fluor's stock was up 87.5 cents a share today, to $51.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
