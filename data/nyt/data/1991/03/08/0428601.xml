        <p>Despite Prime Minister John Major's soaring popularity, his Conservative Party suffered its biggest upset in a decade, losing a special election today in a former Tory stronghold in northern England.</p>
        <p>The centrist Liberal Democratic Party scored a 4,601-vote victory in the prosperous Ribble Valley district, official results showed.</p>
        <p>Previously the Tories enjoyed a 19,528-vote majority and one of their safest seats in the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>"The result is very bad for us," said Chris Patten, the Conservative Party chairman. "It does have a message for us about the community charge," he said, referring to the unpopular poll tax imposed by Mr. Major's Conservative predecessor, Margaret Thatcher.</p>
        <p>The Liberal Democrats' candidate, Michael Carr, won 22,377 votes, or 49 percent, of the vote, compared with 17,776 votes, or 39 percent, for the Tory candidate, Nigel Evans. The Labor Party candidate, Josie Farrington, won 4,356 votes, or 9 percent. The remainder was split among fringe candidates.</p>
