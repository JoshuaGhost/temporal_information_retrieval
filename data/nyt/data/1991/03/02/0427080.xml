        <p>A 47-year-old man wanted in four bank robberies was arrested yesterday as he fled in a taxi after the police said he had pulled off a fifth, at the Bowery Savings Bank branch at 60th Street and Third Avenue.</p>
        <p>The police said the man, Ira Shafiroff, strode into the bank, pulled out a handgun, announced that he was robbing the bank, was given more than $5,000 by a teller and then fled in a cab with the money.</p>
        <p>But two police officers and a sergeant who were on patrol in a police car heard of the robbery by radio, intercepted the taxi and arrested Mr. Shafiroff in mid-fternoon, the police said. He was charged with bank robbery.</p>
