        <p>GUTTERS defend a home against many potentially serious problems like basement leaks, foundation settling, decaying roof framing and soaked, ineffective insulation.</p>
        <p>Because of their importance, they should be cleaned and checked for damage at least twice a year. The best times are in early spring before the rainiest months and in late autumn after the leaves have fallen.</p>
        <p>To reach gutters, use an extension ladder. Stand on the ladder so that the gutter is about chest high. When safely propped, the ladder should extend at least a foot above the edge of the roof. At the base, the distance between the ladder's feet and the side of the house should equal a quarter of the ladder's length.</p>
        <p>Never service gutters by kneeling on the edge of the roof and leaning over. It may cause you to fall.</p>
        <p>For cleaning gutters, you will need a pair of heavy work gloves to avoid scrapes and scratches, a narrow gardening trowel or a plastic gutter scoop and a whisk broom.</p>
        <p>Carry everything aloft in a bucket equipped with a sturdy hook for hanging. Metal ladder hooks for paint buckets are available at hardware stores, or you can make a hook by bending a piece of coat-hanger wire into the shape of an S.</p>
        <p>Hang the bucket from a ladder rung where you can conveniently fill it with gutter sweepings. Using the bucket is important; simply casting any mess to the ground can soil siding and flower beds.</p>
        <p>Start cleaning at a corner near a downspout by sweeping any debris within easy reach into a pile and using the trowel or scoop to shovel the material into the bucket. If there is a leaf strainer in the downspout opening, clean it. Try not to let leaves and twigs fall into the downspout. These can cause blockage.</p>
        <p>After cleaning an area, place the tools on the roof as far in the direction opposite the downspout as you can comfortably reach. For most people, this is about three feet. Then climb down from the ladder, carrying the bucket of debris.</p>
        <p>Empty the bucket, move the ladder about six feet farther from the downspout and repeat the process. When you climb back up to the gutter, the tools should be within reach.</p>
        <p>After all the gutters are swept, flush each one with spray from a hose to check how well they drain. The water should flow smoothly along the gutter and into the downspout.</p>
        <p>If water accumulates in pools along the gutter's length, check the hangers supporting the sections. Reattaching sections that have separated from their hangers will usually cure the problem.</p>
        <p>If water does not drain quickly from a downspout, the spout is probably clogged. To clear it, try using a garden hose. Adjust the nozzle for high pressure and insert the hose into the spout at ground level. Do not insert the hose from the top; this can compact the debris further.</p>
        <p>Turn on the water and then feed the hose upward. Instead of a hose, you can use a plumber's snake or a drain auger. Also insert these from ground level.</p>
        <p>If the downspout goes into the ground or is connected to more than one gutter, rent a motorized auger. To insert it, try to find a section of gutter near ground level that can be removed. The auger can then be directed either up or down. If no section can be removed, insert the auger into the downspout opening at roof level.</p>
        <p>Installing gutter shields will help to prevent future blockages. These protective covers slide under the bottom row of shingles and fit over the tops of gutters.</p>
        <p>Conventional shields are made of wire or plastic mesh. Although they keep leaves out of gutters, they admit smaller debris, and eventually leaves collect on top of the mesh.</p>
        <p>A new style, Elko Gutta-Gards, manufactured by Colonial Metal Products, 2000 Midway Avenue, Petersburg, Va. 23803 (800-255-9032), is made of smooth aluminum sheet with no openings. The front edge curls downward, leaving a gap of about an eighth of an inch above the front edge of the gutter. Water running down the roof flows over the curve and into the gutter; debris slides off and falls to the ground.</p>
        <p>Requiring professional installation are Waterloov Rain Gutter Covers, manufacturered by Waterloov Rain Gutter Cover Systems, 210 Broad Street, Red Bank, N.J. 07701 (201-530-3602). This style covers the gutter completely, admitting water through small slits cut in the cover's curved edge.</p>
        <p>To repair leaks where sections of vinyl or aluminum gutters fit together, use butyl rubber caulking compound. Separate the leaking sections if possible. Apply compound to both surfaces, then reassemble.</p>
        <p>Do not seal expansion joints in vinyl gutters; these allow vinyl to expand and contract with temperature changes. Expansion joints are usually situated where straight sections meet corner fittings.</p>
        <p>If the sections cannot be separated, spread caulking compound over the seam and try to force some into the joint. Then smooth the compound so that water will flow over it easily.</p>
        <p>Galvanized metal gutters will rust through if not kept clean.</p>
        <p>Larger holes, including those in downspout elbows, can be covered with metal patching compound like Mr. Mac's Metal Fix. The compound is applied over fiberglass cloth supplied with the product.</p>
        <p>Wooden gutters should be treated with preservative and repainted about every five years. Be sure the wood is dry, then saturate the troughs with a heavy-duty wood preservative like Cuprinol No. 10 Wood Preservative, which also contains sealer. Follow the instructions.</p>
        <p>Sand and repaint the outside of the gutter with two coats of exterior house paint.  HOME CLINIC</p>
