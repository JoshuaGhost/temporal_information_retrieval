        <p>On the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of daylight fasting and prayer, Kuwaitis were busy Sunday standing in half-mile-long lines, waiting for bread, rice, sugar and oil.</p>
        <p>The more fortunate among them with connections to Government officials got permission to leave the country and drive down to Saudi Arabia, where they could properly observe this most important of Muslim holidays. Some came back loaded with enough sweets, meat and fish to cook a decent meal.</p>
        <p>Recalling Good Times</p>
        <p>"This year, there is not a house in Kuwait that is without sadness," Wafaa al-Fahd, an art student, said today. "We try as much as we can to relive the nice days, but last night was rather sad. There was little food on the table and many bitter memories."</p>
        <p>Ramadan marks the month in which the Koran was revealed to the prophet Mohammed. Because it is observed during the ninth month of the lunar calendar, it falls at different times in the Gregorian year.</p>
        <p>It is a time of repentance, impassioned prayer and charity during which Muslims are required to abstain from food, drink and other pleasures from dawn until sunset. After dusk, the fast is broken, normally with a feast similar to a Thanksgiving meal, which is repeated every night of the month.</p>
        <p>But for Kuwaitis today, Ramadan is a devout period of thankfulness for the recovery of their freedom mixed with deprivation and painful realities left by the Iraqi Army after eight months of occupation. They have to contend with shortages of electricity, food and water, and live with memories of relatives lost -- shot to death, imprisoned, tortured or taken to Iraq as hostages.</p>
        <p>Sunday night was the first night of Ramadan here, and to hear people speak of it, the occasion was almost a traumatic experience. Revelry by Night</p>
        <p>Past Ramadans in Kuwait have been celebrations both of Islam and of good fortune, as they have been in other oil-producing Persian Gulf states. Now people here speak of earlier celebrations in terms of the "old days" as if they were years ago.</p>
        <p>Kuwaitis say that this time last year, life really began at night. The streets of Kuwait came alive with shops open till the wee hours of the morning, and friends would drive their Mercedes Benzes and BMW's to one another's homes, where they would visit all night until the call to prayer echoed just before dawn, signaling the beginning of another day of fasting.</p>
        <p>"The mosques would be filled with people as much as the streets were filled with shoppers," said Nadia al-Qinaii, a teacher at the Higher Institute of Theatrical Arts, which has been closed since the Aug. 2 occupation by Iraq.</p>
        <p>"This year, the streets are dark and empty and your heart almost hurts at the sight of the desolation the Iraqis left behind. I have never seen Kuwait like this. Ever since I was born this was a place of plenty and of happiness." Reflecting on Values</p>
        <p>For many people here, the desolation of the country has translated itself into a deeper introspection, and a stronger adherence to Islam's more austere values.</p>
        <p>"A crisis like this makes a Muslim search within himself for values to counter the bestiality of man," said Usama Abdelrazak, an official of the port administration. "We look around at what they have done, and the only thing you can say is: Thank God, who is, in a situation like this, the only refuge for those who cannot understand why man would do this to his fellow man."</p>
        <p>Kuwaiti television, which during Ramadan normally broadcasts until 4 A.M., is shut down because, without electricity, hardly anyone can see the meager programming being emitted for only a few hours every night.</p>
        <p>"We thank God we are safe now. Thank God they have gone. Thank God some of us were left to see a new dawn," Mr. Abdelrazak said. Anger Remains</p>
        <p>Others cannot, however, repress a widespread anger at their Government, most of whose officials were in exile during the long months of occupation.</p>
        <p>"I cannot accept that the Government, which knew which conditions we were living under, has arrived here with nothing," said Ahmad Bedah, a university student. "They made so many promises from exile about bringing food, generators, water and essential goods, and here we are, almost three weeks after liberation, without electricity, living like beasts."</p>
        <p>On the whole, however, Ramadan is being overwhelmed here by the daily trials of living.</p>
