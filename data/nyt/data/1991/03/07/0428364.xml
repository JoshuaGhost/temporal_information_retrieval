        <p>The speakers above the basketball floor at the Maurice Stokes Physical Education Building were booming a rock-and-roll bass line. The capacity crowd of 3,500, inspired by the anticipation of a first National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament bid for St. Francis College, was being encouraged to scream by the voice that came from those speakers.</p>
        <p>And the basketball had not yet gone into the air.</p>
        <p>More than two hours later, the din having been transformed into delirium, the Red Flash of St. Francis celebrated the bid they earned with a 70-64 victory over Fordham this evening in an N.C.A.A. play-in game.</p>
        <p>"Five years ago, my goal wasn't to be a great player," said Mike Iuzzolino, the 5-foot-10-inch senior and academic all-American whose awareness and unselfishness became more important than his rare shooting skills.</p>
        <p>"It wasn't to be an N.B.A. player," Iuzzolino said. "It was to get to the N.C.A.A. tournament. Tonight, my dream just became a reality."  Fordham Hopes for At-Large Bid</p>
        <p>The Red Flash (24-7), Northeast Conference champions, set a school record for victories in a season. Fordham (24-7) will be forced to wait with far less certainty for the decision of the N.C.A.A. tournament committee in the hope that the Rams could still be extended one of the 34 at-large bids.</p>
        <p>But the Rams, the Patriot League champions, who are hoping to make the school's first N.C.A.A. appearance in 20 years, lost a chance for their most direct route to the tournament when they became the 16th consecutive team to lose to St. Francis here.</p>
        <p>Fordham, which has won 17 of its last 19 games, was stopped by the brilliance of Joe Anderson, a 6-5 senior forward who scored 32 points, the unselfishness of Iuzzolino, and the tenacity of defenders that limited Damon Lopez, the Fordham center. Lopez's two baskets in the final 10 seconds left him with 14 points.</p>
        <p>Anderson's 32 points, 15 of them on five 3-point baskets in eight attempts, came partly as a result of Fordham's educated risk. Anderson had made just 23 of 65 shots -- 35 percent -- in the previous five games. Iuzzolino had averaged 24.5 points this season and 28.5 in his last five games.  Herzog on Defense</p>
        <p>That led Nick Macarchuk, the Fordham coach, to use Fred Herzog, a 6-9 junior, to cover Iuzzolino for much of the evening.</p>
        <p>But with Herzog, Fordham's second-leading rebounder, occupied 20 feet or more from the basket, and with Lopez developing foul problems, the Rams were outrebounded, 33-26. Iuzzolino could use his quickness to seek open teammates, and Anderson had some added room to operate along the baseline.</p>
        <p>Iuzzolino's adjustments and Anderson's renewed confidence became decisive factors. "I was able to beat my man whenever I wanted," Iuzzolino said, "and we got real easy shots off the penetration."</p>
        <p>Iuzzolino had 3 points at halftime, but Anderson scored 18 and St. Francis had a 38-33 lead. A 10-0 Fordham spurt at the start of the second half gave the Rams a 43-38 lead with 16 minutes 29 seconds to play. St. Francis Takes Over</p>
        <p>But from that point, Iuzzolino and Anderson combined for 25 of the next 27 St. Francis points. Lopez was charged with three fouls in a span of 4:25 and had his fourth with 11:09 to go. Jean Prioleau, whose last-second overtime shot had won the Patriot League championship game at Holy Cross, was charged with his fourth with 12:03 to play.</p>
        <p>A 20-7 St. Francis spurt gave the Red Flash a 58-50 lead, and the Rams were never closer than 5 after that.</p>
        <p>The Red Flash began to celebrate, and the Rams began to wait.</p>
        <p>"We're still fighting and hoping to get into the thing," Macarchuk said.</p>
