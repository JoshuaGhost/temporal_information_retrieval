        <p>The Western Union Corporation will defer the semiannual interest payment of $2 million due April 1 on its 13 1/4 percent sinking fund debentures. A spokesman said the company had the funds but wanted to conserve cash. He said the company could avoid default on the issue by making the payment before the expiration of the 30-day grace period on May 1.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, in its 1990 annual report, Western Union said it would not have $42.2 million needed to retire its 16 percent notes that mature June 15 and make the semiannual interest payment on its 19 1/4 percent senior secured notes.</p>
