        <p>The Bush Administration is exploring the possibility of convening regional peace talks, with the United States and the Soviet Union as hosts, that would serve as the opening for direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Western and Middle East diplomats said today.</p>

        <p>The Bush Administration is exploring the possibility of convening regional peace talks, with the United States and the Soviet Union as hosts, that would serve as the opening for direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Western and Middle East diplomats said today.</p>
        <p>While Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has been very tight lipped about what he is trying to do in his talks with Middle East leaders, an approach that appears to be getting a lot of consideration would be for the United States and the Soviet Union to be hosts for a ceremonial opening "event" that might be the political equivalent of President Anwar el-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977.</p>
        <p>The event being considered would be a meeting in which the two superpowers would invite Israel, Palestinian representatives, Egypt, Jordan and, ideally, Syria and the six Arab gulf states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- to a ceremonial opening that would be followed by direct talks.</p>
        <p>The Americans "want to produce some kind of engagement and the critical question is how," said a Western diplomat familiar with the secret discussions. American-Soviet "sponsorship of regional talks is one idea being considered," he said. But the diplomat cautioned that the Bush Administration had not yet settled on exactly which approach it wants to push. Changing the Political Climate</p>
        <p>"Whether anything will work is too early to tell," the Western diplomat said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker did not broach the idea in his meetings with Middle East leaders two weeks ago, but confined himself instead to discussing confidence-building measures that might make it easier for Arab and Israeli leaders to attend such talks by changing the political climate. Mr. Baker and his Policy Planning Staff director, Dennis Ross, have discussed the idea in follow-up conversations with various Middle East officials in the last few days, and neither Israelis nor Arabs have committed themselves one way or another, the diplomats said.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Mr. Baker saw Osama al-Baz, national security adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , and Adnan Abu Odeih, foreign policy adviser to King Hussein of Jordan . Mr. Ross met Tuesday with Hanan Ashrawi, a West Bank Palestinian professor who was in the delegation of Palestinians that Mr. Baker met with during his recent visit to Jerusalem. Israel's Minister of Justice, Dan Meridor, one of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's closest advisers, has also been visiting Washington this week.</p>
        <p>In the present Administration deliberations, after the opening the parties would break into separate Israeli-Arab, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations -- much the way Israel, Egypt and Syria did after the 1973 United States-Soviet Geneva conference. Several venues for such talks have been proposed. Justifying Participation</p>
        <p>The confidence-building measures that Mr. Baker discussed on his trip to the Middle East would be intended to provide the participants with the political cover they would need to attend and to buy some time. Some Arab states, particularly the gulf Arabs, have expressed some unease about going to such a regional meeting as long as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is in power or alive.</p>
        <p>Ideally, confidence-building gestures by Israel to ease the pressure of its occupation of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to reaffirm its commitment to implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, might be used by the Palestinians and the Arab states to justify taking part in such a conference.</p>
        <p>And if Mr. Baker can persuade the Arab countries to move toward ending their state of belligerency with Israel, and possibly all or part of their boycott, the Israeli Government could better justify its participation in such talks. Prime Minister Shamir could argue that that is not the sort of open-ended, gang-up-on-Israel international conference -- in which all five permanent members of the Security Council would be invited -- but rather direct talks with Arab states that have indicated a willingness to reconcile with Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker has been highly secretive about what he is doing, because he feels that it will give Arabs and Israelis more room for maneuver if every proposal is not debated in public and because he and his aides say they truly are not sure whether any of it will work, diplomats say. Several Thorny Problems</p>
        <p>What optimism existed immediately after the defeat of Iraqi forces in Kuwait has given way to sobriety in the Administration. Officials dealing with the process say that neither side is itching to make fundamental compromises, like trading land for peace. The whole idea of trying to organize a ceremonial opening for regional talks is based partially on the hope that a dramatic meeting could create some momentum for substantive progress.</p>
        <p>In his private talks with Middle East leaders, Mr. Baker must sort out several thorny problems, including the question of who will represent the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Also, he must try to establish what would follow the ceremonial opening of such a conference. In 1973, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger already had arranged the Sinai Desert disengagement talks he planned after the Egyptians and Israelis held their Geneva meeting.</p>
