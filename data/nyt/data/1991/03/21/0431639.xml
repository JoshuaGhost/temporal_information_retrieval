        <p>Renee Fleming, the soprano who won the 1990 Richard Tucker Award, was scheduled to make her Metropolitan Opera debut next season. But when the flu forced Felicity Lott to postpone her first Met appearance as the Countess in Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" on Saturday evening, Ms. Fleming, who was covering the role, stepped in and made an early and auspicious debut.</p>
        <p>Mozart's music creates instant sympathy for the Countess, who sings the touching lament "Porgi amor" in her first moments on the stage. But the music cannot do the work alone, and in Ms. Fleming the Met has a lyric soprano who engages the listener immediately. Her timbre is pure and fresh, and she endowed the Countess's arias with the combination of dignity and emotional depth that is the essence of the role.</p>

        <p>Renee Fleming, the soprano who won the 1990 Richard Tucker Award, was scheduled to make her Metropolitan Opera debut next season. But when the flu forced Felicity Lott to postpone her first Met appearance as the Countess in Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" on Saturday evening, Ms. Fleming, who was covering the role, stepped in and made an early and auspicious debut.</p>
        <p>Mozart's music creates instant sympathy for the Countess, who sings the touching lament "Porgi amor" in her first moments on the stage. But the music cannot do the work alone, and in Ms. Fleming the Met has a lyric soprano who engages the listener immediately. Her timbre is pure and fresh, and she endowed the Countess's arias with the combination of dignity and emotional depth that is the essence of the role.</p>
        <p>Her responsive portrayal did not rely solely on the Countess's desolation, but also captured the role's playfulness, anger and, in the end, the Countess's especially graceful form of forgiveness.</p>
        <p>The cast still includes Samuel Ramey as Figaro and Frederica von Stade's exquisite Cherubino. But the other principal singers have changed since the production was last reviewed.</p>
        <p>Marie McLaughlin was a pleasing Susanna, with the right vocal weight and temperament, an appealingly rounded, flexible sound, and good comic instincts. She was at her best, however, in the role's one ruminative moment, the fourth-act aria, "Deh vieni, non tardar."</p>
        <p>The German baritone Andreas Schmidt has taken over the role of the licentious but thwarted Count with reasonable effectiveness. His timbre is attractive and fairly solid, but when he was anywhere but near the edge of the stage he had trouble making himself heard. Also new to the cast were Loretta di Franco as Marcellina, Michel Senechal as Don Basilio, Federico Davia as Antonio and Richard Fracker as Don Curzio, all of whom contributed fully to Lesley Koenig's kinetic ensemble staging.</p>
