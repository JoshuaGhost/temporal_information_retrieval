        <p>The GTE Corporation announced a costly settlement yesterday with John D. Goeken, who built the first air-to-ground telephone service company and sold it to GTE in 1986.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goeken and GTE have been feuding for 25 months over the corporation's management of Airfone since the acquisition.</p>
        <p>The settlement amounts to a personal victory for Mr. Goeken, who founded the MCI Communications Corporation in the early 1960's but lost control of it to the first employee, William G. McGowan, who remains MCI's chairman.</p>
        <p>GTE said it had agreed in the settlement to cancel a clause in its contract to buy Airfone that had barred Mr. Goeken from competing in the same business. Mr. Goeken said GTE also agreed to pay $15.5 million to him and Airfone's several hundred other original owners. GTE declined to confirm that figure.</p>
        <p>As part of the settlement, Mr. Goeken said, he agreed to drop his petition to the Federal Communications Commission asking that GTE be denied a permanent license for air-to-ground telephone service. Airfone has been operating since 1984 under an experimental license and did not receive a permanent license when the F.C.C. awarded them to four new competitors, including Mr. Goeken's current business, the In-Flight Phone Corporation, on Dec. 21.</p>
        <p>The settlement came after many months of damaging evidence presented in Illinois courts, in which Mr. Goeken argued that GTE might have misled the F.C.C. about the market for the air-to-ground phone service in order to discourage the licensing of any competitors. He also accused GTE, which is based in Stamford, Conn., of dishonest tactics in an effort to undermine his authority at the company he built and where he remained chief executive until 1989, when he resigned.</p>
        <p>Both GTE and Mr. Goeken denied any wrongdoing in the settlement, Mr. Goeken said. Tony Hamilton, a GTE spokesman, said GTE had refuted in court all accusations by Mr. Goeken related to the conduct of Airfone, GTE and their employees after the acquisition. "A lot of these comments were made in the process of his making the claim for the cancellation of his non-compete clause," he said. Underpayment Charged</p>
        <p>Mr. Goeken charged in a lawsuit that GTE had underpaid him and Airfone's other original owners by limiting the initial installation of telephones in airplanes. The contract for Airfone's sale in 1986 linked the final price to Airfone's initial profits under GTE's management.</p>
        <p>GTE also sued Mr. Goeken, charging that he violated the clause in the Airfone sale contract in which he promised not to compete by setting up a rival company.</p>
        <p>"GTE believes the amount paid in settlement is reasonable in relation to the cost of continuing to litigate the disputes through trial," Robert C. Calafell, president and chief executive of Airfone, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goeken said he had reached the settlement with GTE on Tuesday and that all related litigation in the state court in Du Page County, Ill., was dismissed the same day. GTE said the Illinois courts had upheld its non-compete agreement with Mr. Goeken on five occasions.  Unusual Disclosures</p>
        <p>Court testimony and depositions in the dispute produced some unusual disclosures. For example, a GTE official admitted in court in 1989 that he and a GTE secretary working for Mr. Goeken had secretly opened some of Mr. Goeken's personal mail before he left Airfone. The official said he had read a statement from Mr. Goeken's personal checking account and photocopied three canceled checks in the mistaken belief that the documents pertained to Airfone.</p>
        <p>In-Flight Phone, the new Goeken company set up in mid-1989, has signed contracts with American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and USAir to provide some pay telephones mounted in the backs of airplane seats. Spokesmen for all three airlines described the contracts as experimental and not representing commitments to the large-scale installation of the new phones.  In-Flight Testing System</p>
        <p>In-Flight is conducting tests of its system this week on the West Coast and plans to begin nationwide service in August, Mr. Goeken said. The company is using a new technique for transmitting calls that prevents the voice heard on the phone from becoming more faint as the airplane moves away from a radio relay station on the ground, Mr. Goeken said.</p>
        <p>Airfone has installed its phones in 1,400 commercial aircraft and on some passenger trains on the East and West Coasts.</p>
