        <p>Four doctoral students representing the University of Virginia won the North American College Bridge Championship, played over the weekend at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>John Prince and Hank Strauch, both of Bethesda, Md., John Miller of Charlottesville, Va., and Scott Tumperi of Newman, Ga., won the final by 10 imps after leading throughout. A stretch drive by Caltech, represented by Mingxiang Li, Yun Sin, Jeff Goldsmith and Sam Dinkin, fell just short.</p>
        <p>On the diagramed deal, both teams failed to reach the desirable six-spade slam and arrived in the second-best contract of six clubs. When Tumperi held the North hand, he had to choose between a cautious pass, a one-spade bid that threatened a rebid problem after a possible two-heart response, and an eccentric weak no-trump. He chose the last of these, and the spade fit was never located.</p>
        <p>In six clubs, the Caltech declarer relied on something good happening in one of the black suits. Since the club jack did not fall, and West did not have the queen-jack of spades, he was defeated. When Miller held the South cards, he won the opening diamond lead with the ace and immediately ruffed a diamond. He cashed his winners in the major suits and ruffed a heart with the club ace.</p>
        <p>He ruffed another diamond and crossed to the club king, leaving this ending: [ DIAGRAM ]</p>
        <p>The club ten scored yet another diamond ruff, and the club queen scored the 12th trick. East's trump winner and West's spade winner collided on the last trick. The Virginia team gained 14 imps, four more than its margin of victory.</p>
