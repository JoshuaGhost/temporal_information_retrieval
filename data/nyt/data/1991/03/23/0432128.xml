        <p>The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union are negotiating how to get some hourly workers to retire early, according to union and company officials who asked not to be identified.</p>
        <p>The workers in question are in so-called jobs banks, employment pools established at factories during work force reductions. Employees in the banks get full pay while they perform non-traditional automotive work, like community service, or attend retraining classes.</p>
