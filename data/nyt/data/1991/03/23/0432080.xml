        <p>The Unisys Corporation, a troubled computer maker, said it was paying $480,000 to 84 key employees to prevent further resignations. Unisys, which lost $1.1 billion in the last two years, has recently lost several senior executives.</p>
        <p>The "retention incentive awards" aim to insure competitive wages for top executives, who received no bonuses in 1989 because of Unisys's poor results, a spokesman, Peter Hynes, said. The company, faced with a slumping computer market and a $3.75 billion debt, has been restructuring its business and laying off thousands of workers. The company's chief executive, James Unruh, who devised the plan, exempted himself from the bonus and received no bonuses for the second straight year, Mr. Hynes said. But Mr. Unruh's salary rose to $581,253 last year from $375,000 in 1989.</p>
