        <p>Three Sumatran dance companies proclaimed the joy of rhythm on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater. They did so with dancing that was loud and clear. Crystalline choreographic designs contributed to the clarity. The loudness resulted from the sounds the performers made as they moved. This dancing was meant to be heard.</p>
        <p>The program, "Music and Dance of Sumatra: Aceh and Minangkabau," brought together troupes from two parts of Sumatra, an island that is part of Indonesia. One group came from Minangkabau, an area of western Sumatra; the others, from Aceh, in the island's northern tip. The presentation was part of Festival of Indonesia, an 18-month celebration intended to acquaint American audiences with Indonesian culture.</p>

        <p>Three Sumatran dance companies proclaimed the joy of rhythm on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater. They did so with dancing that was loud and clear. Crystalline choreographic designs contributed to the clarity. The loudness resulted from the sounds the performers made as they moved. This dancing was meant to be heard.</p>
        <p>The program, "Music and Dance of Sumatra: Aceh and Minangkabau," brought together troupes from two parts of Sumatra, an island that is part of Indonesia. One group came from Minangkabau, an area of western Sumatra; the others, from Aceh, in the island's northern tip. The presentation was part of Festival of Indonesia, an 18-month celebration intended to acquaint American audiences with Indonesian culture.</p>
        <p>Remplis Mude, a company from Aceh under the leadership of Atif Usman, offered a form of precision drill known as Saman. Its 13 members made rhythm visible. They knelt side by side in a line, then bent forward and back, swayed and twisted, clapped their hands, snapped their fingers and slapped their thighs and chests.</p>
        <p>The slappings grew faster and the choreographic patterns more complex as some dancers bent to one side while their companions bent to the other. Yet everyone always returned to a perfect unison. Although, at times, the men seemed to be working at an enormous machine, nothing they did dehumanized them. These were laborers happy to manufacture good cheer.</p>
        <p>Companies that specialize in Seudati, another rhythmic form from Aceh, are named after their leaders. Syekh Lah Genta and the ensemble of two singers and eight dancers that bore his name turned themselves into human drums. The dancers marched, stamping vigorously, and gathered in a circle. But what made their motions unusually percussive was the way they slapped their bodies. They even wore crisp shirts intended to make the slaps resound with special force. Seudati was controlled revelry.</p>
        <p>Martial arts were blended with dancing in the presentations of Gumarang Sakti Minangkabau, choreographed by Gusmiati Suid, the company's artistic director, and her son, Boy GS. The choreography emphasized crouches and stances with bent knees that made the participants appear poised for battle. When they moved, to original scores for strings, percussion and wind instruments by Hajizar Bin Mustafa, the company's musical leader, they lunged and thrust out their arms as if to ward off attackers.</p>
        <p>But these fighters had no enemies. Indeed, when men and women paired off in one sequence, what started out looking like a duel became a courtship ritual. The warfare in which these performers from Minangkabau specialized was a struggle against disorder. Their martial dancing celebrated the triumph of form over chaos, of art over accident.</p>
        <p>The Sumatrans remain through tomorrow night at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street.</p>
