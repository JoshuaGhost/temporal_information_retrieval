        <p>South Africa will appoint four government ministers in Ciskei, a nominally independent black homeland, under an agreement to begin Ciskei's reincorporation into South Africa, the homeland's leader said.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, reached late Wednesday, South Africa will give Ciskei financial aid, technical and personnel assistance and help in maintaining law and order.</p>
        <p>Ciskei's leader, Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo, called the agreement "the first step on the road to incorporation into a new, nonracial South Africa."</p>
        <p>Ciskei is one of four black homelands granted independence by South Africa in the 1960's and 1970's as part of its apartheid policy. No other country recognized the sovereignty of the lands.</p>
        <p>A statement by the South African Foreign Affairs Minister, Pik Botha, said South Africa would designate officials acceptable to Ciskei to be ministers of finance and state administration; transport, public works and agriculture; justice, and economic affairs.</p>
        <p>Ciskei is ruled by a military council installed after General Gqozo seized power in a March 1990 coup, saying he wanted reincorporation.</p>
        <p>"It is my hope for the coming year that greater stability will return to this region," General Gqozo said. The general was referring to two coup attempts in recent months in which he has implicated the African National Congress, South Africa's largest black opposition group. The A.N.C., which opposes the homeland system, has denied involvement.</p>
