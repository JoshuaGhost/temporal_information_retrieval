        <p>Six months after tightening its vehicle emissions controls to match California's strict rules, New York State plans to go even further in 1995, again following California's lead, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The rules would mean cleaner air but more expensive cars for New Yorkers, state officials said.</p>
        <p>Under the program, the state estimates that an additional 30,000 tons of pollutants a year would be kept out of the air by the year 2000. The emissions controls would add an average of $150 to the cost of a car, on top of $150 from the rules adopted last fall, state officials estimate.</p>
        <p>Thomas C. Jorling, the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, said that continuing to follow California's emissions standards was New York's only hope of complying with Federal pollution rules. 'Most Cost-Effective Means'</p>
        <p>In September, New York adopted California's standards for 1993 car models, requiring manufacturers to reduce emissions of smog-causing substances and to make vehicles' emissions-control equipment more durable. Since then, California, which has the nation's worst air quality, has tightened its standards further.</p>
        <p>Under the Federal Clean Air Act, only California can set its own emissions standards. Other states can either follow California or pursue the national standards, which are more lenient.</p>
        <p>Because New York chose to follow California before, its only choices after California adopted stricter rules were to switch to the national standards or follow California again, Mr. Jorling said.</p>
        <p>Adopting California's standards "is the most cost-effective means available to reduce air pollution in New York State," Mr. Jorling said. "Without significant additional reductions in mobile-source pollution, New York will be forced to place severe controls on industry and restrict both vehicle use and industrial growth." 3d Largest Car Market</p>
        <p>There are some differences between New York's and California's rules for 1995. California is to phase in how many cars have to meet specific emissions standards to reach the state's air-quality goals in each year after 1994. New York has the same air-quality goals, but has not specified how they will be met.</p>
        <p>If New York has trouble meeting Federal pollution standards, a mandatory phase-in schedule like California's will be imposed, Mr. Jorling said. Such a system would also require making low-polluting fuels available, something which will be required in California if it is to meet its ambitious emissions standards.</p>
        <p>California has the largest new passenger car market in the nation. New York is third, after Florida, according to 1989 information from the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.</p>
        <p>The state will hold hearings on the proposed emissions regulations for 1995 in the spring. The rules are to be adopted by the Department of Environmental Conservation by December, Mr. Jorling said.  What Causes Smog</p>
        <p>The 1993 emissions standards will not be affected by those planned for 1995. Under the 1993 standards, manufacturers must certify that 40 percent of the vehicles for sale in New York in that model year meet the emissions standards. The percentage rises to 80 percent in the 1994 model year and 100 percent in 1995.</p>
        <p>Emissions standards regulate the amount of pollutants like hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide that a vehicle can discharge from its tailpipe. Smog is formed when hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen mix in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight.</p>
        <p>Almost half of the hydrocarbon emissions come from cars and trucks. The New York metropolitan area violates Federal health standards for smog and carbon monoxide, which is a product of incomplete engine combustion.</p>
        <p>Telephone calls to spokesmen for automobile manufacturers on New York State's new antipollution plans were not answered yesterday evening. Suit Is Pending</p>
        <p>In the past, the manufacturers have resisted state efforts to adopt the California standards. In January, they sued the state, asserting that the 1993 California standards could not be adopted without legislative approval.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorling says the lawsuit, which is pending, is without merit.</p>
        <p>A state Senate Environmental Conservation Committee hearing on adopting the 1993 standards is scheduled for 10:30 this morning in the Suffolk County Legislature Auditorium in Hauppauge.</p>
