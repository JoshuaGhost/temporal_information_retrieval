        <p>When the buzzer sounded tonight, the St. Peter's players gathered at center court, danced a little, surrounded Coach Ted Fiore in a group hug, and then danced a little more. The Peacocks had just won their first Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference championship, but more important, they had earned their first trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.</p>
        <p>The Peacocks' 64-58 victory over Iona, before 6,413 fans at the Knickerbocker Arena, was a classic example of how defense wins championships. No one played better defense than Marvin Andrews, a forward for St. Peter's (24-6).</p>

        <p>When the buzzer sounded tonight, the St. Peter's players gathered at center court, danced a little, surrounded Coach Ted Fiore in a group hug, and then danced a little more. The Peacocks had just won their first Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference championship, but more important, they had earned their first trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.</p>
        <p>The Peacocks' 64-58 victory over Iona, before 6,413 fans at the Knickerbocker Arena, was a classic example of how defense wins championships. No one played better defense than Marvin Andrews, a forward for St. Peter's (24-6).</p>
        <p>Considered the best defensive player on the league's best defensive team, the 6-foot-3-inch Andrews was assigned to contain Iona's 6-5 forward, Sean Green, the league's leading scorer at 23.7 points per game. In the semifinals, Green had overwhelmed Siena for a tournament record 16 field goals and 43 points. He had also scored 30 points in a victory over St. Peter's in mid-February.</p>
        <p>Tonight, though, Andrews held Green to just 10 points on 5 of 15 shooting. Andrews finished with 13 points, an effort that helped him earn the most valuable player honors. Iona (17-13) shot 36.7 percent from the field, far below the 68 percent it hit in upsetting Siena.</p>
        <p>Gary Brokaw, the coach of Iona, praised Andrews as "a great defensive player."</p>
        <p>Andrews said his strategy was to play Green to Green's left, to make it easier to interfere with his shot.</p>
        <p>"I could feel his frustration," Andrews said. "He shot a couple air balls and I felt I could make him shoot his team out of the game."</p>
        <p>Even with Green neutralized, Iona stayed close. Trailing by 25-20 at the half, Iona closed to within a point on consecutive 3-pointers from Antoine Lewis early in the second half. St. Peter's rebuilt the lead to as many as 7 points by shooting 89 percent from the free-throw line.</p>
        <p>The Peacocks put the game away when Jasper Walker, who finished with a game-high nine assists, grabbed a rebound after Antoine Lewis missed a 3-point attempt and heaved a long pass to Andrews, who finished the scoring with an emphatic dunk. The Jersey City school will now complete its 58th season at its first N.C.A.A. tournament.</p>
        <p>"We made St. Peter's history," Fiore said. Penn State 52, Temple 50, G.W. 82, St. Joseph's 80</p>
        <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Freddy Barnes made three free throws in the final 19 seconds and the Nittany Lions, aided by a critical technical foul against Temple, defeated the Owls in the first Atlantic 10 Conference semifinal game. In the second semifinal, Dirk Surles scored 24 points and the freshman guard Alvin Pearsall hit two free throws with 9 seconds left in overtime to lift the Colonials.</p>
        <p>Penn State (19-10), in its last season in the conference before shifting to the Big Ten, will be the host team for the championship game on Thursday night against George Washington (19-10).</p>
        <p>Temple (21-9), which had won the conference title three of the last four years, led by 47-42 on a layup by Mark Macon with 4:35 remaining. Monroe Brown then hit a 3-pointer for Penn State, and Barnes made two free throws with 2:47 left to tie the score.</p>
        <p>C. J. Johnson made two free throws with 2:22 to play to give the Nittany Lions a 49-47 lead. Temple called its final timeout with 36 seconds left and missed a shot on the ensuing possession. But the Owls retained the ball when it went out of bounds. Attempting to inbound the ball, Temple's Mik Kilgore called a timeout to avoid a 5-second violation, but the Owls were over the limit and a technical foul was charged.</p>
        <p>Barnes hit both free throws to give the Lions a 51-47 advantage, but Penn State couldn't inbound the ball within 5 seconds and Temple took over. Macon, who was 6 for 22 from the field, then hit a 3-pointer with 11 seconds left. Barnes made one of two free throws with 5 seconds left and Macon's shot at the buzzer fell short. Richmond 81, George Mason 78</p>
        <p>RICHMOND (AP) -- Jim Shields scored 18 of his 26 points in the second half to rally Richmond to the victory for the Colonial Athletic Association championship. Kenny Wood added 10 points, all in the second half, as the second-seeded and defending champion Spiders (21-9) earned their second consecutive trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament and their fifth in eight years.</p>
        <p>Fourth-seeded George Mason (14-16) lost to Richmond for the 11th time in their last 12 meetings. South Alabama 86, Old Dominion 81</p>
        <p>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Derek Turner's 3-pointer with 2:43 remaining gave South Alabama the lead for good and the Jaguars held off the Monarchs to win the Sun Belt Conference tournament and an N.C.A.A. berth. South Alabama (22-8), the regular-season champion and tournament host, won the title for the second time in three years.</p>
        <p>Old Dominion (14-18) had pulled off two upsets to reach the championship game.</p>
        <p>The Monarchs grabbed the lead midway through the first half and were ahead, 40-34, at halftime. South Alabama trailed until a steal and dunk by Kevin McDaniels gave the Jaguars a 58-57 lead with 10:57 remaining. The lead changed hands four times until a Turner 3-pointer put the Jaguars ahead for good. UConn Women Win Title</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kerry Bascom scored 26 points for Connecticut, which squandered most of a 17-point lead before holding off Providence, 79-74, in the championship game of the Big East Conference women's tournament.</p>
        <p>Tracy Lis scored 29 points for Providence (25-5), which cut a 49-32 deficit to 73-70 with 40 seconds left only to have the Lady Huskies (26-4) hit six consecutive free throws down the stretch.</p>
