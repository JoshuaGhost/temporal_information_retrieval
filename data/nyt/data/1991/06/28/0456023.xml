        <p>Stanford University has filed sexual harassment charges against a cardiologist at the university's medical school, based on complaints made by two female medical students.</p>
        <p>The university president, Donald Kennedy, said Wednesday he had filed administrative harassment charges and professional misconduct charges against Dr. Mark Perlroth.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the 53-year-old cardiologist said he "vigorously denied" the allegations and accused the administration of using him as a scapegoat for the embarrassment of unrelated charges of sexism made by a female surgeon who resigned last month.</p>
        <p>The complaints against Dr. Perlroth were made by two students in December and February. One said Dr. Perlroth had made inappropriate sexual remarks; the other said he had denied her a teaching-assistant job because she refused to have sex with him.</p>
        <p>The charges were filed with a seven-member faculty advisory board. Dr. Perlroth would have the right to appeal any sanctions.</p>
        <p>In May, Dr. Frances Conley resigned from the School of Medicine, saying she had endured years of sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>Stanford officials denied that there was any link. "The reason we publicized this is because it's so unusual," a Stanford lawyer, John Schwartz, said.</p>
        <p>Complaints are usually handled internally, with the accused faculty member accepting a sanction to avoid public charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said in a statement that he filed the charges after Dr. Perlroth refused to accept such sanctions.</p>
        <p>In filing charges, Mr. Kennedy said he had recommended that if Dr. Perlroth is found guilty he should be disciplined through closer supervision and a possible one-year suspension without pay, but not dismissed.</p>
