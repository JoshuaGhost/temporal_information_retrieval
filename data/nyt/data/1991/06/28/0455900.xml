        <p>Le Pescadou</p>
        <p>The widespread popularity of bistros in New York City, paired with the surging consumption of seafood, made the all-seafood bistro inevitable.  Enter Le Pescadou, a smart-looking little place in SoHo that serves an invariably fresh and diverse catch at reasonable prices.</p>
        <p>The three-month-old restaurant has an ownership connection with Chez Jacqueline on Macdougal Street; in fact, this was the original site of Chez Jacqueline before it moved to Greenwich Village. A handsome but unair-conditioned bar in the front has wraparound windows looking out on an urban sideshow. On a steamy summer evening we declined an offer of a table there in favor of the air-conditioned main dining room, a homey space with pale yellow walls, brass sconces, a wide-plank wood floor and a fireplace. It can feel rather close when the room fills up, but background noise is rarely so loud that you cannot converse.</p>
        <p>The chef, Jean-Jacques Duvernes, came from La Rochelle on the southwest coast of France to run the kitchen. His menu is well balanced, and the quality of his seafood is outstanding. It is not easy to find a first-rate fruits de mer plate (cold assorted shellfish appetizer) in New York City. This one is as close to what you get in a Paris brasserie as you'll find: a pizza-size platter heaped with ice and seaweed and replete with big, sweet langoustines, two types of oysters (depending on availability), briny littleneck clams, mussels, bigorneaux (periwinkles) and crayfish. Mussels are also served in a traditional mouclade, cooked in a subtle combination of white wine and cream.</p>
        <p>Not everything was so stellar. A vichyssoise at lunch one day was pale and acidic. A better soup was the crayfish bisque supported by a sturdy crayfish stock and enriched with tomatoes and herbs. A nice light starter is the salad of assorted greens, ribbons of carrots and zucchini, and grilled sweet scallops.</p>
        <p>Young French waiters with accents as thick as bearnaise are jovial and hard working, too. They know their fish and shellfish, and some even offer help with the petite wine list, which could use a few more good whites under $20.</p>
        <p>For those who like their fish straight and unembellished, there are a fine Dover sole meuniere with a tasty vegetable-and-seafood mousse, and excellent roasted black sea bass infused with charred fennel.</p>
        <p>Several of the more involved dishes are pleasing, too. Red snapper fillet was delicate and sprightly in a light sauce of red pepper and cream with broccoli and carrots. The chef's elaborate version of bourride, the Provencal fish soup usually made with monkfish and one or two other Mediterranean fish, has langoustines, crayfish, mussels, salmon, monkfish and vegetables -- hardly a peasant dish. Nonetheless, when the broth is bound with a heady aioli (garlic mayonnaise), it is compelling. Salmon cooked in a balloon of aluminum foil was exceptionally moist, but a blizzard of herbs, particularly tarragon, overwhelmed it. And grouper was done in an interesting if not entirely successful way, the fillet cut into bite-size morsels and served in a red wine sauce with a skein of leeks in the center. A touch of salt could have rescued this bland combination.</p>
        <p>Desserts are the anchor of this smooth-sailing vessel. Among the best sampled was a clafoutis that really wasn't a clafoutis but was good anyway: custardy cake stuffed with prunes. Individual strawberry tarts were satisfying, but a so-called sherry souffle came out looking and tasting like an omelet and without sherry flavor. Most other desserts were fluffy and forgettable.</p>
        <p>One diner quipped that Le Pescadou is the poor man's Le Bernardin. That might be a stretch, but for seafood fans it's a welcome arrival. Miracle Grill</p>
        <p>It's an unlikely place to find a credible Southwestern restaurant, in the raffish southeastern quadrant of Manhattan cluttered with tiny ethnic eateries, bustling dairy restaurants and spooky-looking bars. The three-year-old Miracle Grill transcends the flock of beans-and-iceberg-lettuce dining spots, most of which dole out more starch than a Chinese laundry.</p>
        <p>The regional setting is evoked by an undulating adobelike wall in the front room, American Indian artifacts scattered about and hammered copper lamps over a long wooden bar. The back room has a cluster of wooden tables facing the open kitchen. Outside is a dining deck, covered with a canvas tent, that opens onto a sizable garden with an ivy-covered wall, garden pathways, shade trees and flower beds.</p>
        <p>A fine way to cool off is with one of the superior margaritas. (The peach flavor is dangerously delicious.) Judging from the servers' casual street garb and easygoing attitudes, one might expect service to be lackadaisical at best. Over three visits, though, our waitresses were prompt, pleasant and knowledgeable about the food.</p>
        <p>Jose Carranza, the chef, worked under Bobby Flay, now the chef of Mesa Grill. Mr. Carranza has a clean and relatively light approach to this kind of cooking. One of the best appetizers was a special, seared tuna over tostadas layered with black beans and corn. Black bean and jalapeno soup had the texture of a puree; it came on meekly, then ignited in an afterburn of hot peppers. A tasty quesadilla filled with cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses had flowerettes of guacamole puree and cubed ripe tomatoes around the perimeter. A fritter of potatoes and rock shrimp had little appeal on its own, but a zippy sauce of roasted poblano chili brought it to life. Then again, this sauce could bring typing paper to life. Grilled shrimp on skewers were fresh and well cooked, served with tabbouleh, the Middle Eastern bulgur salad, and tart citrus vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Miracle Grill has a short wine list consisting mostly of California labels, with a few Texas reds thrown in. Prices are fair.</p>
        <p>On the main-course roster, one dish that typifies the chef's deft touch with textures is grilled tuna. Blush-pink in the center and nicely seared outside, it is swathed with an assertive cilantro pesto and bedded on a nest of sauteed julienne of zucchini and red peppers. Sweet papaya garnish provides color and a contrast to the pungent coriander. Simpler but flavorful dishes include the moist chicken fajitas with black beans, onions, guacamole and sour cream; a flour tortilla filled with shrimp, rice and black beans, along with a zippy salsa verde; and a blue-corn tostada topped with morsels of crisp, spicy fried chicken and ringed with beets, salad greens, tomato and a sour-cream salsa.</p>
        <p>When the kitchen stumbles, it is usually for a minor lack of seasoning, as in the pale-tasting grilled lamb brochette with jalapeno preserves, jicama slaw and humdrum cilantro tomatillo suace. There is no seasoning problem, though, with the tender grilled pork chop, enhanced with a chutney of Anaheim chilies and mangos, although the gratin of sweet and white potatoes could use salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Although the neighborly waitress was offhanded about dessert, we managed to scrape up a good vanilla-bean flan with strawberry sauce, and brittle chocolate bunuelos that were terrific with vanilla ice cream. On another visit, we sampled a chocolate ancho cake that, like the chili, carries a one-two punch. It first yields a dry chocolate sensation that quickly dissolves into a shooting gallery of hot peppers. It's recommended only for hardy souls.</p>
        <p>Although appearances suggest that Miracle Grill does not take itself seriously, its Southwestern fare is serious indeed. And with downtown prices, it's worth a trip. Le Pescadou</p>
