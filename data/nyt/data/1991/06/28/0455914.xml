        <p>What a paradise Central Park can seem! Especially this summer, when the recession threatens New York City's cultural institutions. In the last few years, the park has developed free children's programs from hat-making workshops to a wake-up aviary tour. These activities -- especially the ones conducted by the Urban Park Rangers, whose numbers were recently depleted by layoffs -- are likely to suffer. But some of the park's more interesting spots are used for workshops and adventurous pursuits, some of them sponsored by the Central Park Conservancy and others by the Department of Parks and Recreation, that will be offered this weekend and should be in place for the summer. Call the Parks Department at (800) 834-3832 to check on any last-minute changes. In any case, there's always the Sheep Meadow, if all that's wanted is some splendor in the grass.</p>

Call the Parks Department at (800) 834-3832 to check on any last-minute changes. In any case, there's always the Sheep Meadow, if all that's wanted is some splendor in the grass.</p>
        <p>Belvedere Castle  79th Street, west side of the park, south of the Great Lawn  Recommended ages for workshops: 5 to 11  (212) 772-0210  Tomorrow</p>
        <p>Belvedere Castle stands on top of craggy Vista Rock like an imperious mother, looking down on the childlike Belvedere Lake below. You have to climb a seemingly endless trail of stairs; don't even think of going up with baby strollers. Restored in 1982, the castle is now surrounded by shrubs, grasses, meadows and flowers, and seems to have been created as a setting for a dark Bavarian fairy tale in which love is lost and never found. It often serves as the meeting point for family workshops or adventures, also sponsored by the Central Park Conservancy. But nothing too sinister or frightening happens.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow "Ninja Turtles vs. Park Turtles" will be the topic of a discussion led by Allen Salzberg of the New York Turtle and Tortoise Society. Mr. Salzberg will begin by asking what Ninjas eat, where they live, how they protect themselves, where they get their skills and why they say "Cowabunga, dude!" Children, naturally, will have all the answers. Then Mr. Salzberg will ask them about real turtles and, presuming the audience will not be as informed about these creatures, he will fill in the blanks. Real live turtles will be on hand for children to draw. The free workshop, which runs from 1 to 2:30 P.M., requires registration. Adults need to remain with their children. All materials are included. Urban Park Rangers  Walks and talks  (212) 427-4040  Recommended ages: 8 and up  Sunday</p>
        <p>The Urban Park Rangers are kindly experts on the history, design, geology, wildlife and botany of the city's parks. On weekends, in the large city parks, the rangers conduct tours and workshops -- walking, nature, sky gazing, you name it -- that not only enlighten children but also instill respect for igneous rocks, centipedes and trees like viburnum.</p>
        <p>The rangers also have a sense of humor and of romance. On Sunday, they will inspire participants with poetry, the nature kind, with a workshop called "Kindred Spirits." The rangers will lead a walk while reading selections from Shakespeare to Whitman, but they ask that participants bring their own, too, including original poems. The walk will start at 100th Street and Central Park West at 2 P.M. and end up at the Sheep Meadow about two hours later. Hans Christian Andersen Storytelling Hour</p>
        <p>West side of Conservatory Water, entrance at 72d Street and Fifth Avenue  (800) 834-3832 or (212) 794-6564  Recommended ages: 5 and up  Saturdays through Sept. 28</p>
        <p>For 34 years stories have been told under the paternal, almost melancholy eye of the Hans Christian Andersen statue. The large bronze sculpture, which is kept company by an attractive Ugly Duckling, was financed with the pennies of Danish and American schoolchildren and Danish businessmen to keep the spirit of Denmark alive in New York City. Installed in 1956, the site is a literary cul-de-sac at the otherwise buzzing boat pond.</p>
        <p>Diane Wolkstein, a professional storyteller and writer who leads the program, was first given an audition for the job in 1967 by the Baroness Ida-Gro Dahlerup, a Dane whose mother had proposed the statue. Children and adults (who are asked to remain during the storytelling hour) sit on chairs provided by the Parks Department while Ms. Wolkstein spins stories from memory, with a dash of improvisation. Tomorrow's story is "The Emperor's New Clothes." The readings begin at 11 A.M. and last about an hour. The Dairy</p>
        <p>Midpark at 65th Street, north of Wollman Rink  (212) 794-6564; Friday and Saturday afternoons, (212) 794-6565  Recommended ages for workshops: 5 to 11 Tomorrow</p>
        <p>The Dairy is so charming and quaint that you look back at it as you walk away to make sure it's real. With its Hudson River Gothic style and romantic loggia -- which offers a good escape from the sun -- the Dairy seems to have been pulled out of an Edith Wharton story. In fact, it was built in 1870 -- about 20 years before Wharton published her first collection of stories -- to distribute fresh milk to children. Nowadays, it's the locale for Central Park Conservancy's free family workshops. It's also a restful visitors' center with a 12-foot model of the park under glass inside. Under the loggia is a map of Central Park to help you get your bearings.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's workshop is "Design-a-Park." Participants will become landscape architects by role playing and enacting the events that led up to the creation of Central Park. Some will be asked to play Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the masterminds who designed the park. Even adults may test their acting skills by becoming, say, the person who dynamites boulders. Then, under the tutelage of the Master Stonebuilder (Dina Friedman, the assistant manager of the Dairy), children will be challenged to create their own three-dimensional parks out of recycled materials, paper, crayons and markers. There may even be a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end. If the weather is fair, the workshop, which is from 1:30 to 3 P.M., will be held under the loggia. Adults are asked to stay with the children during the entire workshop, and reservations are required. KEEP IN MIND</p>
        <p>"MONKEYING AROUND," a workshop taught by a zoo instructor, in which 5- and 6-year-olds will observe four species of monkeys, with an emphasis on Japanese snow monkeys, and an animal arts-and-crafts project. At the Central Park Zoo, 64th Street and Fifth Avenue, Manhattan. Sunday from 10 to 11:15 A.M. Admission for one child accompanied by an adult: $14 for members, $16 for nonmembers.

At the Puppetworks Theater, 338 Sixth Avenue (at Fourth Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn. Saturdays and Sundays at 12:30 through July, Saturdays at 12:30 in August. Admission: $5 for adults, $4 for children. Reservations: (718) 965-3391. "FOUR CORNERS," a theatrical dance work presenting childhood experiences from around the world. At the John Drew Theater, 158 Main Street, East Hampton, L.I. tomorrow at 4 P.M. Tickets: $8 for adults, $5 for children. Information: (516) 324-4050. HOME FARM FESTIVAL, with arts and crafts demonstrations, choral and instrumental concerts, puppet shows, games and field activities for children, handicrafts bazaar and refreshments, all near the Shawangunk Mountains, and sponsored by the School of Practical Philosophy. At the Borden Home Farm, Borden Road, Wallkill, N.Y. Tomorrow and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M., Admission: $6 for adults, $3 for children ages 5 and up. Free parking. Information: (212) 744-0764. SUBWAY SLEUTH SELF-GUIDED TOUR, a family tour of the Transit Museum using a pamphlet that tests subway skills -- figuring out which lines go where, for example -- as it leads from one exhibition to another. At the New York Transit Museum, Boerum Place and Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn Heights. Tuesday through Friday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.; Saturday 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.; beginning July 8, the museum will be open Mondays as well. Admission: adults $2, children $1. Information: (718) 330-3063. STORYTELLING, presenting "The Three Billy-Goats Gruff," "Casey at the Bat" and "The Little Engine That Could," among others, using mime, song and narrative, produced by the PIE Story Theater. In the Cherry Hill area of Central Park, 72d Street and Central Park West, beyond Strawberry Field and the Daniel Webster Monument, west of Circular Drive. Tomorrow at 11:30 A.M., 12:15 and 1:30 P.M.; Sunday at 1:15 and 2 P.M., Free. Information: (212) 769-0527.</p>
