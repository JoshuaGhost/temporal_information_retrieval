        <p>To the Editor</p>
        <p>"Literary Echoes, on the Road" (editorial, May 20), which praises books on tape, is puzzling.</p>
        <p>While everyone around the country is bemoaning the growing problem of illiteracy and urging people to read, you tell them that being read to is much better than reading.</p>
        <p>Then, you propose a literary hierarchy based on the quality of the experience, with books below books on tape, though these are separate media, which require varying degrees of participation and produce a different experience. Where in that hierarchy would you put movies? Poetry readings? Television programs?</p>
        <p>I hope you would not suggest that experiences in these genres are substitutes for the experience of one's own reading. They aren't. They are different literary experiences, with basic grammars that appeal to various audiences. That appeal depends on, among other things, length and type of education, family background, socialization, nationality, religion, culture and profession.</p>
        <p>Finally, would you write an editorial in favor of television news programs and state that having the news read to you is better than reading it yourself? HAROLD AUGENBRAUM Director, Mercantile Library New York, May 22, 1991</p>
