        <p>Chavez, 75-0, of Culiacan, Mexico, is a three-time champion who won the W.B.C. title in March 1990 by stopping MELDRICK TAYLOR. Brazier, 75-10-1, of South Bend, Ind., is the W.B.C.'s No. 5 contender. Safety said he did not know if the fight would be rescheduled. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING</p>
