        <p>I am lucky to be married to a wonderful woman who juggles with exceptional success her lives as wife, mother and businesswoman. After reading Elizabeth Joseph's fascinating article about the advantages of polygamy ("My Husband's Nine Wives," Op-Ed, May 23), my first thought was to send it to my wife, together with a note suggesting how much easier her life would be if she permitted me to marry several additional women.</p>
        <p>I tossed that notion aside, however, when I imagined her likely response: "Let me make your life easier, honey; I'll look for some additional husbands instead."  MARTIN DOMB  New York, May 23, 1991</p>
