        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee (news article, May 23) that he does not believe "there is any bigger obstacle to peace than the settlement activity," referring to Israeli settlements in the territories, was most unfortunate. Far from focusing attention on the real problems, he seemed to single out Israel as the party most responsible for obstructing peace.</p>
        <p>Considering that nearly half a century after the establishment of Israel, its Arab neighbors (with the exception of Egypt) have yet to recognize Israel's right to exist -- with or without the territories -- such an accusation is a gross distortion.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that the continued proliferation of settlements is not damaging to the peace process. Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Housing Minister, has made it clear that the purpose of settlements is to preclude the possibility of territorial compromise. There is a critical point, which the Israeli Government's policy is fast approaching, beyond which there will be nothing to negotiate about.</p>
        <p>No Arab country is likely to engage Israel in negotiations that do not offer a possibility of territorial compromise, even if the creation of a Palestinian state is precluded.</p>
        <p>That may not trouble right-wing members of the Israeli coalition Government, who believe -- for religious and nationalistic reasons -- that territories are more important than peace. But for those who believe that peace is critical for Israel's economy, security and capacity to absorb Soviet and Ethiopian immigrants, to destroy the possibility of peaceful relations is nothing short of a calamity.</p>
        <p>But Arab failure to recognize Israel's legitimacy is a prior obstacle to peace. It is time for the United States to tell Saudi Arabia, Syria and the Palestinians that their delay in coming to terms with Israel's legitimacy and permanence in the region is not cost-free, and that if they continue, the United States will do nothing to prevent further Israeli settlements.</p>
        <p>But if the United States is to take this position with Arab governments, it must also insist that Israel's Government put on hold further settlement activity. HENRY SIEGMAN Executive Director American Jewish Congress New York, June 6, 1991</p>
