        <p>New York City taxi inspectors recently discovered something under the dashboard of a taxicab that caused them great concern: the driver had spliced his radio microphone into his meter so that whenever he pressed the "talk" button on the microphone, an electrical pulse caused the meter to click off extra miles.</p>
        <p>Despite the Taxi and Limousine Commission's efforts in recent years to crack down on such practices, there is increasing evidence that fast meters remain plentiful.</p>
        <p>The radio microphone hook-up was one of the more sophisticated schemes that taxi officials found in recent months.</p>
        <p>"It was an ingenious setup that has caused us to start looking more carefully," said Louis C. Calcagno, who directs the taxi commission's safety and emissions division, which inspects meters. The use of fast meters, some taxi drivers and meter shop owners said, has increased because of a weak regional economy in which there are fewer fares.</p>
        <p>"You have some drivers out there who have no scruples and will find any way they can to tamper with these meters to earn a few extra bucks, especially when times are hard," said Robert R. Russnak, president of the New York Independent Taximeter Shop Association. While no one knows for sure how many cabbies are using fast meters, taxi officials have several indications that the number is substantial.</p>
        <p>One indicator is meter testing at the commission's vehicle inspection center in Woodside, Queens, prompted by passenger complaints.  Dramatic Rise in Cheating</p>
        <p>From July 1, 1990, to May 31, 1991, the meters on 341 cabs were tested, the commission's statistics show, and 42 percent were found to be running fast. In the previous year, 366 cabs were tested, and 10 percent were fast.</p>
        <p>The increase is so great that commission officials feared the statistics might be wrong.</p>
        <p>Typically, the commission says, fast meters overcharge passengers about 25 cents a mile. Thus a five-mile ride without waiting time, a trip that should cost $8.75, would cost $10 with a fast meter.</p>
        <p>The rule of thumb for passengers is that a properly set meter should click off 25 cents every four short blocks.</p>
        <p>The taxi meter is connected to the vehicle's transmission and determines how far the vehicle has traveled. The most common way to make the meter run faster is to "zap" it, or connect it to something that transmits an electrical pulse, like the directional signal. But some drivers alter the pinion gear attached to the transmission or manipulate tire pressure or size.</p>
        <p>Taxi commission officials said that in recent weeks they had uncovered a significant number of fast meters in spot checks of cabs on city streets.</p>
        <p>In one such test on a major thoroughfare in Manhattan on Tuesday, inspectors pulled over Koffi Tsogbe, a 41-year-old cabby from the Bronx, and instructed him to drive down a one-mile test run. The stretch should cost exactly $2.75, because the taxi meter is reset to count only the distance traveled and not waiting time. The commission allows drivers 75 feet of leeway. 18 of 43 Fail the Test</p>
        <p>About 250 feet before the end of the one-mile stretch, Mr. Tsobge's meter registered $3. Andres La Salle, an inspector, gave him a summons that requires the meter to be recalibrated before the taxi can go back into service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsogbe, who has driven a cab for 14 years, complained bitterly that the cab and its meter had been leased.</p>
        <p>"This is very unfair," he said. "It's not my fault."</p>
        <p>Of 43 taxis so tested in the last week, officials said, 18 failed the meter test.</p>
        <p>When a rider complains to the commission that a driver has overcharged by using a fast meter, the agency instructs the driver to go to its center in Queens to have the meter tested. But not all fast meters have been tampered with. Many run fast, commission officials said, because drivers fail to have them recalibrated after repairs or mechanical changes to the vehicle. A new transmission or new tires, for example, may cause the sensitive electronic meters to overcharge.</p>
        <p>Technicians at Midtown Taximeter Sales and Service in Manhattan said that of the 100 taxi meters they put through a one-mile test each year, about 20 failed because drivers had tampered with them. "In the past you didn't have as many drivers deliberately cheating people, but it seems to be getting worse," said a technician who spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>Taxi commission regulations require drivers to have their meters calibrated and sealed by a licensed taxi meter shop at least once a year. The meter shop performs two tests.</p>
        <p>In one, called a bench test, the meter is removed from the taxi and connected to a device that transmits electrical pulses to determine if the meter is registering correctly.</p>
        <p>The second test is conducted with the meter inside the taxi. The cabby drives down a one-mile stretch, and the tester observes if the meter is charging the correct amount.</p>
        <p>Drivers who fail to have their meters recalibrated after mechanical changes to the cab or who have been found tampering with meters are subject to fines of $25 to $300 and possible suspension or revocation of their hack licenses and medallions.</p>
        <p>Fidel F. DelValle, whom Mayor David N. Dinkins has nominated as chairman of the taxi commission, said passengers who believed they had been overcharged because of a fast meter should ask the driver for a receipt and then file a complaint with the commission.</p>
        <p>Although some cabbies complain that random meter testing is unfair, Salvatore Saporta, who has been driving a taxi for 22 years, isn't one.</p>
        <p>"I like this very much," he said after passing a meter test on Tuesday. "People always complain that we try to rip them off. This test will insure that we are all accurate."</p>
