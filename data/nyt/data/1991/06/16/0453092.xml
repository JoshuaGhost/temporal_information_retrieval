        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your June 5 front-page report on the suicide of Mao Zedong's widow, Jiang Qing, who came to symbolize the fanatical fury of China's Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, states she was born under the name Li Jin in 1914.</p>
        <p>Actually, Ms. Jiang was born under the name Luan Shumeng, the second part of which means "pure and simple." By the time she reached elementary school, she received a new name, Yunhe, or "Cloud Crane." After having become an actress at 14, she assumed the stage name Lan Ping, meaning "Blue Apple."</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1938, having joined Mao at the wartime stronghold of the Chinese Communists in Yenan, she took the name by which the world came to know her, Jiang Qing, or "Azure River."  BRADFORD TREBACH New York, June 6, 1991</p>
