        <p>ABIS, the new Japanese restaurant in Greenwich, is easy to spot by its blue ceramic tile roof entrance on Greenwich Avenue.</p>
        <p>Inside, a sense of authenticity continues, with a further suggestion of roof edging one wall, from which traditional Japanese cast-iron lanterns are hung. A tatami mat section is recessed along one wall; you remove your shoes to enter, then sit on cushions, tucking your feet into an open space beneath the table. The center dining area gives way in the rear to a sushi bar, where you can select from a display of fresh sea creatures and watch the sushi chefs at work. (The clear plastic wrap around each piece of fish may help retain freshness, but it isn't very esthetically pleasing.)</p>

        <p>ABIS, the new Japanese restaurant in Greenwich, is easy to spot by its blue ceramic tile roof entrance on Greenwich Avenue.</p>
        <p>Inside, a sense of authenticity continues, with a further suggestion of roof edging one wall, from which traditional Japanese cast-iron lanterns are hung. A tatami mat section is recessed along one wall; you remove your shoes to enter, then sit on cushions, tucking your feet into an open space beneath the table. The center dining area gives way in the rear to a sushi bar, where you can select from a display of fresh sea creatures and watch the sushi chefs at work. (The clear plastic wrap around each piece of fish may help retain freshness, but it isn't very esthetically pleasing.)</p>
        <p>Lunch is especially cheerful in the elevated front area, with a white pebbled garden at the base. If you order an obento, with everything contained in one simulated lacquer box, there are four choices, all offering fine value. The sashimi (with the sliced raw fish artfully arranged), sushi (an assortment of nigiri-zushi and nori-maki) and tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet divided into segments, served with a tangy sauce) were especially fresh and tasty.</p>
        <p>Not quite up to snuff was the tempura box, though, as in all the Abis entrees, the portion was more than ample for the price ($7.25). But, like the tempura dishes we ordered as appetizers and entrees, the batter-dipped and deep-fried shrimp and slices of yam, green pepper, onion and mushrooms were not served piping hot, a must for this crispy crunchy dish to succeed. Furthermore, the batter wasn't as sheer and gauze-like as tempura should be.</p>
        <p>At dinner, numerous appealing appetizers are offered. Diners fond of crab should latch on to kani-su, an abundance of snow crab in vinegar sauce, or crab butter yaki (grilled with butter, lemon and white wine sauce) served prettily in a shell. If you are adventurous, there's tako-su (slices of snow-white octopus, decorated with green seaweed, in a vinegar sauce). Tofu fans should enjoy age-dashi-dofu (four big butter-smooth bean curd cubes, deep-fried, with chopped scallions and a soy-based sauce), a far better choice than the bland hiyayakko, which lacked its customary sprinkling of bonito flakes and chopped scallions. Negima-yaki (scallions wrapped in thin slices of beef in a teriyaki sauce) would have had more kick if the scallions were crisper. You might opt instead for yakitori (two skewers threaded with soy-painted chicken bits) or a zesty unagi kabayaki (broiled eel).</p>
        <p>For sushi lovers, Abis has a wide selection of fresh fish and seafood, including giant clam, octopus and sea urchin, served in the traditional nigiri-zushi (seasoned mounds of rice with fish on top), nori-maki (vinegared rice with a bit of fish, cucumber, or other morsel in the center, wrapped in a sheet of dried seaweed called nori) or temaki (a handroll or cone of nori filled with vinegared rice capped with raw tuna, yellowtail or other fish). The regular assorted sushi provides a pleasing feast of sushi (no temaki) reasonably priced. Sushi lovers may prefer to choose favorites from the a la carte sushi menu. Especially delicious were the tekka temaki (tuna) and unagi temaki (with soy-lacquered baked eel).</p>
        <p>Other worthy entrees were unagi-ju (rice topped with broiled, lacquered eel), sweet-tasting snow crab grilled with carrots and other fresh vegetables and a scallop fry of well-browned sea scallops and vegetables.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two (two appetizers, two entrees, rice, small salads and green tea) cost $31.90, before tip or tax. The dinner entree price is supposed to include soup, an appetizer of the day and ice cream or sherbet as well, but on three of our visits, none of these items was mentioned or served. Abis has no liquor license, but you may bring your own beer or wine. The name Abis is derived from a god who promises longevity, happiness and success in business. It seems an apt omen for this well-priced, good-value restaurant that could quickly become a dining habit.  Abis</p>
