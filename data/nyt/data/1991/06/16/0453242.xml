        <p>Summer handbags can range from modified pockets for loose change and lipstick to oversize totes for a book, cool drink and a Walkman.</p>
        <p>Bloomingdale's offers a wide range, including Donna Karan's white canvas tote with black canvas trim, $95, and Furla's white leather handbag with brown trim and optional shoulder strap, $285.</p>
        <p>A brown woven leather handbag with a long shoulder strap by DeVecchi is $578. A mocha straw handbag with a detachable shoulder strap by Magid is $45.</p>
        <p>A playful yellow leather bag by Desmo ($300) is shaped like a pea pod with brown leather handles.</p>
        <p>Carey Adina makes three handbags for Bloomingdale's. Her Domino style, at $450, is a structured square of black patent leather with three white dots on the front. It also comes in white leather, with three black dots.</p>
        <p>A rectangular clutch of white leather, with black over-matched argyle-inspired diamonds on the front, is $345.</p>
        <p>A pyramid of silver leather has a loop handle at the peak. One side of the pyramid opens. The bag is $385.</p>
        <p>At Charivari, 18 West 57th Street (Fifth Avenue), the options are belligerently unlike the solemn bags of autumn.</p>
        <p>Totes by Lilliana Motta have long sides of plywood, given a matte finish and resistance to picnic stains with polyurethane. The handles and short sides are of red or black canvas.</p>
        <p>Small triangle-shaped styles are $130; big totes and brightly striped canvas duffels lashed to plywood boxes on casters are $195.</p>
        <p>Also at Charivari are Jennifer Graham's black vinyl totes with gold sunbursts, $215.</p>
        <p>A duffel by Coconuts, covered with black sequins, is $95. Mazzarotto marries an ultrafine plastic mesh -- it captures the breezy swish of a swinging screen door -- with a sturdy leather bottom and trim, $150.</p>
        <p>Quilted vinyl knapsacks, in black or white, with gold stitching, by Us Two, are $50.</p>
        <p>Summer bags at Unisa, 701 Madison Avenue (62d Street), offer a variety of attitudes and prices. All are available with matching shoes.</p>
        <p>The Florence totes ($62) are of raw silk, in black, fuschia, silver, champagne, or vibrant checks that include grape, teal, ivory, fuschia and yellow. Matching flats are $44.  Nubby Canvas</p>
        <p>The Marina tote is of nubby canvas in navy and white or white with navy stripes, $92; matching espadrilles are $39. The Madeline linen totes in black, mustard, or olive are $75. A muted floral version, an amber background with soft rose and celery print, is $92.</p>
        <p>At Outre Mer, 91 Spring Street (Broadway), totes imported from Mexico are of hand-braided raffia strips dyed in blue, red, mauve, white or yellow to create geometrical designs or checkerboards of various color combinations.</p>
        <p>The bags are about a foot square and five inches deep.</p>
        <p>Paul Stuart, Madison Avenue at 45th Street, sells a handwoven tote from Italy that is made of handstained buttery leather with braided leather handles and closure for $458.</p>
        <p>At Mark Cross, 2 World Financial Center or 645 Fifth Avenue (52nd Street), there is the Town and Country tote of textured calfskin. It comes in red, olive, black, russet and white with navy trim and is $350.</p>
