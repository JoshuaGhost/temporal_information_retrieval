        <p>In the latest skirmish in the credit card wars, the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that one of its financial services units would offer a credit card as a marketing tool to help retain old Ford customers and attract new ones.</p>
        <p>But the Chrysler Corporation may also be planning to enter the credit card business, according to The American Banker, a trade publication. Unlike the Ford program, Chrysler's effort would be for private-label cards that would not carry the Chrysler logo but rather the name of a furniture store or similar issuer, the publication said.</p>

        <p>In the latest skirmish in the credit card wars, the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that one of its financial services units would offer a credit card as a marketing tool to help retain old Ford customers and attract new ones.</p>
        <p>But the Chrysler Corporation may also be planning to enter the credit card business, according to The American Banker, a trade publication. Unlike the Ford program, Chrysler's effort would be for private-label cards that would not carry the Chrysler logo but rather the name of a furniture store or similar issuer, the publication said.</p>
        <p>Officials of Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 auto maker, could not be reached for immediate comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ford, the No. 2 car maker, plans to offer its credit card to "several hundred thousand" customers who have bought or leased a Ford car or light truck in the last three years, as well as to potential customers who might own a competing make, like the General Motors Corporation's Cadillac.</p>
        <p>Ford said it planned to expand the program within a year to other customers, employees and the general public. "We'd like to offer it to anybody who's even thinking of driving a Ford," said Fredrick H. Stern, a spokesman for the Associates, the Ford subsidiary offering the card.</p>
        <p>The Visa or Mastercard would carry no annual fee. The card would have an introductory six-month annual percentage rate of 15.9 percent and would rise afterward to 19.8 percent, a typical interest rate for bank cards. It would also offer an annual rebate of five-tenths of a percent to 1.5 percent of the value of purchases made with the card.</p>
        <p>Ford said the rebates and the lack of an annual fee would substantially lower the card's cost to consumers.</p>
        <p>The Associates, a unit of Ford's financial services group, has American assets of $18.8 billion. It has been issuing credit cards since 1978 and was acquired by Ford in 1989.</p>
