        <p>The new HP 9000 and the HP 3000 systems and servers employ RISC computer chips. RISC, for reduced-instruction-set computing, is fast becoming the new standard for driving powerful computers that handle complex programs. The machines, just slightly bigger than personal computers, start at $13,000 and are aimed at business users.</p>
