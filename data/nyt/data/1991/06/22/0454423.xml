        <p>While Congress is debating substantial changes in banking regulations, some of which could curb the powers of state regulators, Derrick D. Cephas was confirmed by the State Senate late last week as New York's Superintendent of Banks. He will replace Jill M. Considine, who resigned earlier this year to take a job at the American Express Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cephas, 39, a partner who specializes in banking law at Breed, Abbott &amp; Morgan, was general counsel at the Banking Department for two years in the mid-1980's.</p>

        <p>While Congress is debating substantial changes in banking regulations, some of which could curb the powers of state regulators, Derrick D. Cephas was confirmed by the State Senate late last week as New York's Superintendent of Banks. He will replace Jill M. Considine, who resigned earlier this year to take a job at the American Express Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cephas, 39, a partner who specializes in banking law at Breed, Abbott &amp; Morgan, was general counsel at the Banking Department for two years in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>As an appointee of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Cephas is understandably mindful of the banking industry's importance to New York's economy and is wary of ceding the State Banking Department's powers to Federal regulators. "I understand the impetus for more centralized regulation, but there is validity to arguments that we should recognize the strongly local interest in banking," he said.</p>
        <p>"A lot of innovations have come out of the states," he added, including NOW accounts, one of the earliest forms of interest-bearing checking accounts, and rules specifying the maximum length of time a bank may withhold availability of money deposited by check.</p>
        <p>The New York Banking Department is pre-eminent among state regulators. It is responsible for supervising many of the New York-based subsidiaries and branches of the world's largest foreign banks, as well as large state-chartered American banks like Morgan Guaranty Trust, Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. At the more purely local level, it also regulates smaller banks, savings institutions and credit unions that have state charters, as well as mortgage lenders and check-cashing businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cephas said he favored large banks entering new businesses, opening branches and combining with other banks across state lines. He opposes a Treasury Department proposal that foreign banks be required to operate their branches as separately capitalized banks, because it would become too difficult for them to do business in the United States, resulting in job losses for New York and inviting retaliation against large American banks in foreign markets.</p>
        <p>As for allowing commercial companies to own banks, another goal of some large New York City banks, Mr. Cephas said that he was reserving judgment pending more thought about the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cephas and his wife, Donna, live in Manhattan and have a house in the northeastern part of Long Island, where he maintains a flower garden. "I'm not serious enough about it to make a new career, but I like to jazz up my yard, and add a few new perennials each year," he said.</p>
