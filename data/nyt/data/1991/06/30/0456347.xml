        <p>The Cincinnati Reds have lost their third starting pitcher in two weeks. Right-hander SCOTT SCUDDER couldn't throw yesterday in Cincinnati, and doctors diagnosed tendinitis in his right arm. Manager LOU PINIELLA said Scudder would probably have to go on the 15-day disabled list.</p>
        <p>That'll give the Reds three disabled starters: Scudder, left-hander NORM CHARLTON and right-hander JOSE RIJO. Charlton went on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis after he couldn't get loose June 18, and Rijo broke his left ankle while sliding June 20.</p>
