        <p>BREAK AND ENTER, by Colin Harrison. (Avon, $4.95.) While his mother is suffering from cancer and his marriage is falling apart, an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia tries to solve a double murder. "In this intensely felt first novel, Mr. Harrison heroically balances the philosophical drama of a man's crisis of faith with the puzzle-narrative of a legal whodunit," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.</p>
        <p>THE POLITICS OF RICH AND POOR: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath, by Kevin Phillips. (Harper Perennial, $9.95.) Like the Gilded Age of the 1880's and 90's and the Roaring 20's, the 1980's were a time of tax cuts, deregulation, weakening of the unions, financial speculation, runaway debt and an increase in the number of millionaires. And now as then, Kevin Phillips predicts, the excesses of the rich will lead to a backlash of populism. "Drawing on an array of basic economic data, Mr. Phillips succeeds in placing the carryings-on that make headlines against the background of a wider trend toward markedly greater inequality of income and concentration of wealth," Dennis H. Wrong said here last year.</p>

        <p>WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, by Mary Elsie Robertson. (Laurel, $8.99.) Jessie Farquarson makes no progress in her search for her missing husband, Dwayne, until she consults a psychic who lives on an island near Seattle. In 1989 our reviewer, Regina Weinreich, said the author is "at her best when describing the down-to-earth -- for example, in telling how Jessie is wooed by the hapless Dwayne, whose idea of a good time is collecting ants and watching them race across the kitchen table."</p>
        <p>WHAT'S THAT PIG OUTDOORS? A Memoir of Deafness, by Henry Kisor. (Penguin, $8.95.) The book editor of The Chicago Sun-Times tells what it was like for a deaf person to pursue a career in journalism. "Henry Kisor's book, with its solid core of Emersonian self-reliance, may well become an American classic," Carlton Lake said here last year.</p>
        <p>A SMALL TOWN, by Shelby Hearon. (Warner, $9.95.) As seismologists roam the town, trying to predict when the next big one will come, the people of Venice, Mo., find diversion in the scandalous goings-on of Alma van der Linden, the doctor's daughter who married her high school principal and is now working as a reporter on the town newspaper. In 1985 our reviewer, Elizabeth Tallent, said " 'A Small Town" is fine in dealing with the funny malaise of childhood, those small-town seizures of ennui."</p>
        <p>GORBACHEV: Heretic in the Kremlin, by Dusko Doder and Louise Branson. (Penguin, $9.95.) "The central paradox of Gorbachev's rule," the authors write, is that "the more he sought to disperse power, the more he found it necessary to concentrate power in his own hands." Last year our reviewer, Marshall D. Shulman, said this book provides "a useful reminder for general readers of the roller-coaster volatility of the tumultuous events of the last five years."</p>
        <p>L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, by James Ellroy. (Mysterious Press, $5.99.) This novel about Los Angeles in the 1950's centers on the stories of three corrupt policemen, each obsessed with a different crime. "There must be a hundred characters -- give or take some fractional body parts -- embroiled in all the interlocking plots and subplots about the 'astounding audacious perversion' of the period," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.</p>
        <p>THE THROWING MADONNA: Essays on the Brain, by William H. Calvin. (Bantam, $13.) A neurophysiologist speculates that women, clutching their babies with one arm and throwing stones with the other, may be responsible for the development of right-handedness, language and sequential reasoning. The author provides "a great deal of information in bite-sized essays that are easy to read," Maya Pines said here in 1983.</p>
        <p>BONES AND SILENCE, by Reginald Hill. (Dell, $4.50.) While rehearsing to play God in a local mystery play, Andy Dalziel, a police superintendent in Yorkshire, tries to catch a murderer and find an anonymous woman who keeps making heartbreaking suicide threats. "No other genre author, P. D. James and Ruth Rendell included, writes with such feeling and understanding of silently unhappy women," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.</p>
        <p>BITTER VICTORY: The Battle for Sicily, 1943, by Carlo D'Este. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) Gen. Sir Harold Alexander's battle to take Sicily in World War II was a case study in mismanagement, the author concludes. "Carlo D'Este, a retired American Army lieutenant colonel, is a fine military writer," Walter Lord said here in 1988. He has "great imagination in using his materials. And he is utterly candid." The publisher has also reissued DECISION IN NORMANDY ($14.95), Mr. D'Este's critique of another British general, Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery. "It is the best-researched, best-reasoned, best-written account of that campaign I have read," Drew Middleton said here in 1984.</p>
        <p>"G" IS FOR GUMSHOE, by Sue Grafton. (Fawcett Crest, $5.95.) Kinsey Millhone, the California private eye, is the target of a hired assassin. Last year our reviewer, Alex Kozinski, said Sue Grafton "certainly knows how to turn a phrase and has a playful eye for detail."</p>
