        <p>The Mesa Limited Partnership, the big natural-gas producer headed by T. Boone Pickens, eased its bulging debt troubles today by raising $616 million in long-term debt from several insurance companies and other large institutions in a private transaction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickens pledged more than half of Mesa's total reserves, including 1.2 trillion cubic feet in the Hugoton field of Kansas and Oklahoma, as security for the notes. Mesa has 2.1 trillion cubic feet of total reserves.</p>
        <p>As a result of the deal, Mesa will be able to stretch out payments on its $1.2 billion debt at slightly higher interest rates. The deal also temporarily removes the threat of forced auctions of reserves to pay lenders. Earlier this year, bankers forced Mesa to sell 17 percent of its reserves for $440 million in cash.  Tough Road Ahead</p>
        <p>But gas prices are depressed, at $1.25 per 1,000 cubic feet, and with yearly interest expenses of $140 million, Mesa faces a tough road back to profitability. The partnership lost $204 million last year, dividend payments were eliminated and the price of its common units, which traded above $16 in 1987, have plunged. They closed unchanged at $3.25 today on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Pickens said Mesa needs gas prices to recover to near $2 per 1,000 cubic feet before it can make a profit again. He said that was not likely before 1993, but that the new financing meant that Mesa would not face another debt crunch until 1996, when $300 million in notes mature. "We bought ourselves a lot of time," he said.</p>
        <p>Gambling in 1988 that gas prices would rise to $3 by 1990, Mr. Pickens added $700 million to Mesa's debt load when he acquired some of the gas reserves of Tenneco Inc.  Fast Recovery Called Unlikely</p>
        <p>The purchase made Mesa one of the nation's largest independent gas producers, but now some analysts believe gas prices are not likely to rise fast enough for Mesa to meet debt payments and develop new reserves even with the new financing pact.</p>
        <p>"While this deal buys Mesa time, it does not change Mesa from a liquidating entity," said Timothy J. Curro, an energy analyst at UBS Securities Inc. in New York. He said gas prices are not likely to reach the $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet that Mr. Pickens is hoping for by the mid-1990's, and that Mesa will fall short of cash needed to replace its yearly production.</p>
        <p>Mesa received an average price of $1.61 per 1,000 cubic feet for its gas last year, "and we don't think it will be any better than that for 1991," Mr. Pickens said. A combination of unusually warm winter weather and discoveries of abundant new reserves have depressed gas prices to the lowest level in 15 years. But Mr. Pickens asserted that the new financing package gives Mesa the flexibility to "ride out these bargain-basement natural gas prices."</p>
        <p>The transaction, managed by Salomon Brothers Inc., raised the $616 million from approximately 30 insurance companies, pension funds and other large institutions. The Cigna Companies, a large insurer, acquired 24 percent of the notes through various subsidiaries. Other institutions were not identified.</p>
        <p>The notes were issued with 15 different maturities extending through the year 2012, with yields between 7.5 percent and 11.3 percent. They were secured by unusually long-lived producing fields owned by Mesa, where the average life of a well exceeds 15 years. The Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation gave the notes an investment-quality rating of A.</p>
        <p>Rights to the reserves involved in the transaction were placed in a new Mesa subsidiary, the Hugoton Capital Limited Partnership, which issued the secured notes. Guaranteed payments on the notes were fixed according to production rates and prices, with the lowest price set at $1.35 per 1,000 cubic feet and ranging higher, Mr. Pickens said.  Extra Revenue Possible</p>
        <p>The terms require Mesa to make up the difference if gas prices are lower than the fixed price agreed to by the note holders. But Mesa can retain the extra revenue if market prices for gas are higher than the guaranteed payments on the notes.</p>
        <p>Mesa estimated that about $175 million of the notes would be paid by June 30, 1996, and that the remainder would be paid by 2005. If production falls below projections, payments on the notes can be extended to 2012.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickens said $550 million of the money raised today replaced short-term bank debt, and that $66 million was designated for a cash reserve for the new subsidiary. Mesa also signed a new bank credit line of $150 million arranged by Societe Generale of France.</p>
