        <p>As an emergency room physician, Dr. John Kitzhaber has spent much of his professional life in the fast-motion treatment of bleeding patients.</p>
        <p>Now, as the author of a plan that could make Oregon the first state to insure that health care is provided for all its citizens, Dr. Kitzhaber is trying to use triage on a system that he considers shamefully ill.</p>
        <p>Wearing his two hats, as President of the Oregon Senate and as a small-town physician, Dr. Kitzhaber has helped his state fashion a medical plan that is the talk of professional journals. The plan is also being widely discussed in political circles and in countries, including Canada and Britain, that are looking for ways to keep their national health care systems solvent.  Working With Congress</p>
        <p>His next target is Congress, whose approval is needed within the next year if Oregon is to begin carrying out its groundbreaking plan that ranks and limits care. Dr. Kitzhaber says that the Federal Government has refused to offer anything to the 32 million Americans without health care and that now that the states are trying to solve the problem Congress must show some leadership or get out of the way.</p>
        <p>Oregon's plan, part of a package of legislation passed two years ago, would extend Medicaid benefits to all people with incomes below the poverty level and would set a minimum standard of care for those with private insurance. It would do this by rationing treatments, based on a list of what would be covered and what would not. The current system, Dr. Kitzhaber says, rations people.</p>
        <p>The Oregon plan represents a major shift in the delivery of health care from the issue of who is covered, to what is covered.</p>
        <p>If the plan is to proceed, Congress must authorize a waiver of the current rules for Medicaid, the health care system for the poor that is jointly financed by the Federal and state governments. Medicaid, created to provide health care for the poor, last year covered less than half the people living below the official poverty level because of inadequate financing by the states and Federal Government.</p>
        <p>"If we can force the debate to one between the current system and what Oregon is offering, I'm convinced we will win, because the current system is indefensible," Dr. Kitzhaber said.</p>
        <p>Wearing jeans and a floral tie, Dr. Kitzhaber was working the Oregon Legislature in the last days of the session, which is expected to end in mid-June. It has been another year of triumph for his health bill, which was born amid headlines and controversy and has now moved to center stage as one of the most talked-about ideas in health care.</p>
        <p>The man behind the experiment is a 44-year-old native of the Northwest who practices politics and medicine with equal fervor. A graduate of Dartmouth College, he received his M.D. from the University of Oregon Medical School and has practiced medicine for 17 years in Roseburg, in the timber country of southwestern Oregon. A liberal Democrat, he was first elected to the Oregon Legislature in 1978, and is in his fourth term as President of the Senate. The Plan's Birth</p>
        <p>Dr. Kitzhaber says his idea was born of frustration at seeing "people we were lopping off on one end of the system ending up in the emergency room." His plan was to have a system that emphasized preventive care, he said, and this was codified in the rationing list.</p>
        <p>"Believe me, I'd prefer a Federal solution," Dr. Kitzhaber said, "but we can't wait for Congress to get its act together while 40,000 children in the United States die, every year, before their first birthday."</p>
        <p>After much uproar in the early stages of the Oregon plan, criticism in this state has been muted. The priority list, ranking 808 disorders and their treatments based on a formula that is equal parts mathematics and public opinion, has received international attention as a pioneering experiment.</p>
        <p>As it is, 204,000 Oregonians who qualify for Medicaid receive a relatively rich package of medical benefits, while those who are not poor enough -- mostly people in low-paying jobs -- receive nothing. Medicaid would be extended to an additional 77,000 people here, that is, everybody below the Federal poverty level, and the benefits would be trimmed, based on the list.</p>
        <p>The cutoff, the line below which public financing would not be provided, is to be drawn in the next few weeks as the state Legislature finishes its budget deliberations. Officials say that if $30 million is added, as expected, to Oregon's current annual share of Medicaid of $257 million, then the line on the list will be drawn somewhere around 600. The 200 or so disorders and treatments that would not be covered include lung transplants, acne, Parkinson's disease, reconstructive breast surgery and terminal AIDS with less than 10 percent chance of survival. Those who are terminally ill can get hospice care, counseling and medication for pain relief through the plan.</p>
        <p>Some early critics, among them businesses and groups representing the poor, have largely become allies of Dr. Kitzhaber.  Covering Everybody</p>
        <p>"The reason we're winning converts is because everybody in Oregon is going to be covered, one way or the other," he said, "and we're doing it with a concise model for how to contain costs."</p>
        <p>Dr. Kitzhaber said the two basic models for national health care -- one financed primarily by employers and the other by government -- were doomed to failure until they addressed the question of keeping costs down.</p>
        <p>"Congress has not had the guts to look at the fundamental question, which is: What medical services are really appropriate and what are not?" he said.</p>
        <p>By assuring everyone a minimum level of care -- even if that means one system for the rich and one for the poor -- the most glaring leaks in the system are covered, he said. As an example, he noted that a family of three with an income of $5,500 a year is considered too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid in most states. But that family would be covered in Oregon.</p>
        <p>"That is rationing of health care, and legislative bodies do it every budget cycle," he said.</p>
        <p>The Oregon plan is not without critics. In Congress, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and a leading voice on health care issues, said he was concerned that Oregon set a bad example by taking an already small pie and cutting it into more pieces, taking benefits away from the poorest of society.</p>
        <p>A similar complaint was made by members of the Children's Defense Fund, which follows medical and social issues affecting children. "It's not that we object to rationing, per se, it's just that we don't like singling out children, who make up half the Medicaid population, for rationing," said Molly McNulty, a health specialist with the group. "We are not defending the status quo, but we don't see the answer as scaling things back."  Answering the Critics</p>
        <p>Dr. Kitzhaber says he is perplexed at criticism from those with whom he has always felt a political kinship. "They are measuring the Oregon plan against an ideal world, and, of course, it's got problems when you put it that way," he said.</p>
        <p>The states, Oregon among them, continue to be the innovators in universal health care, but with mixed results. Hawaii's system requires that employers provide insurance for their workers, but it does not address the poor who are working part time and do not qualify for Medicaid. Massachusetts has a similar plan, but it is threatened by the recession.</p>
        <p>Oregon's plan, even the part that requires employers to provide insurance, would use the priority list to keep costs down and still assure a minimum level of care.</p>
        <p>In an editorial in last month's Journal of the American Medical Association, the Oregon plan was described as "a bold attempt to maximize health care benefits" and "an ambitious experiment that should be encouraged."</p>
        <p>Dr. Kitzhaber says that trying something as innovative as a universal health system is much easier in a state like Oregon, with its population of less than 3 million and its growing economy. "Of course, it helps to be a doctor and President of the State Senate," he said.</p>
