        <p>The Berlin Philharmonic, routinely described as one of the great orchestras of the world, arrived on Thursday at Carnegie Hall for a three-night run (the last concert is a Mozart-Brahms bill tonight). There were moments of beauty in the orchestral playing. But on the whole this was an occasion that called routine opinion into question.</p>
        <p>Although Americans have been able to keep tabs on the Philharmonic through its many recordings, its actual New York appearances have been oddly infrequent over the last decade.

James Levine led a single performance at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1986, during Carnegie Hall's renovation.</p>

        <p>The Berlin Philharmonic, routinely described as one of the great orchestras of the world, arrived on Thursday at Carnegie Hall for a three-night run (the last concert is a Mozart-Brahms bill tonight). There were moments of beauty in the orchestral playing. But on the whole this was an occasion that called routine opinion into question.</p>
        <p>Although Americans have been able to keep tabs on the Philharmonic through its many recordings, its actual New York appearances have been oddly infrequent over the last decade. The late Herbert von Karajan, its "conductor for life," brought it here in 1982, but thereafter used the Vienna Philharmonic for his New York concerts. James Levine led a single performance at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1986, during Carnegie Hall's renovation.</p>
        <p>Claudio Abbado was named Karajan's Berlin successor in 1989, three months after Karajan's death. But these three concerts are being led by Bernard Haitink, who, like several other prominent conductors, has annual commitments for concerts and recordings with the Berlin orchestra. Since the Philharmonic is administratively self-governing, since Karajan had effectively withdrawn from any leadership role years before his death and since Mr. Abbado spends much of his time in Vienna, one can say that for all practical purposes the Berlin Philharmonic has been on its own for at least a decade.</p>
        <p>Sad to say, it sounded that way on Thursday. The program opened with Haydn's Symphony No. 95 in C minor. Mr. Haitink used a reduced orchestra (some 45 musicians), but the playing still seemed heavy and rough, lacking in both the sensuous sheen and the propulsive wit of any great Haydn symphony performance, on period or modern instruments.</p>
        <p>In the Bruckner Ninth Symphony after the intermission, the playing was better, but still not up to the level of Karajan's own magisterial Bruckner performances. This was partly a matter of tonal distinctiveness, leading to fears that the Berlin Philharmonic is in the process of being homogenized into yet another generic international orchestra. But it was also, more disturbingly, a matter of simple execution.</p>
        <p>The brass sounded noble all night. But the winds were more erratic, and the strings, upper strings especially, seemed gritty and abrasive in the way any string section can sound when the players are insufficiently in tune. It would be silly to suggest that the overall playing was outright bad; this remains a great orchestra. But there are a lot of great orchestras in the world today, at least five in the United States alone. On the basis of Thursday's concert, the Berlin Philharmonic is now just one among many.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haitink did not contribute much to the evening's enjoyment, either. A curiously neutral conductor, he has occasionally revealed music through his very diffidence, able to "stand back and let it all be," as Bruce Springsteen once said of New Jersey street poets.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, however, his reticence translated into blandness. The Haydn was foursquare, and the Bruckner lacked the drive and drama, or the calm majesty, or the mystical depths, that other conductors have brought to this music. The Scherzo, its elfin Trio especially, did go well. But that was not enough to redeem a disappointing evening.</p>
