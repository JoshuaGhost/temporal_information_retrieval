        <p>STEADY customers at S. Scherer &amp; Sons are expected to know: Tropical waterlilies are not sold there before the end of May, when pond temperatures reach 70 degrees. Which is not to say that some regulars at this Northport, L.I., aquatic nursery did not sweet-talk Walton Scherer, or Grandpa, as he is known, into letting them have one of his spectacular bloomers sooner.</p>
        <p>But then spring 1991 arrived hot and early. And the water garden business is booming this year.</p>
        <p>Water as a design element -- in square ponds or round, formal or naturalistic, gushing, gurgling or still -- appears to be among the newest garden trends.</p>
        <p>In fact, it is among the oldest. From tomb paintings of Egyptian lotus to ribald Renaissance fountains of Italy, water in its myriad forms has enhanced gardens and enthralled gardeners since at least 3000 B.C.</p>
        <p>What gardeners seem interested in these days is not a fountain or a trickle but a combination of water, plants and sometimes fish in a balanced ecosystem. It is often an ecosystem balanced with an electric pump.</p>
        <p>"I think one reason for the renewed interest in creating a small backyard pond is that people now want to reduce the size of their lawns," said Robert W. Scherer, the president of the small family-owned nursery. "They want less fertilizing, soil contamination, mowing and watering. They like a water garden's easier maintenance."</p>
        <p>Proof of this new interest is sales. In the mid-1980's, the average number of waterlilies sold by Scherer's during a season was 700. Last year, it topped 1,200.</p>
        <p>And so it was, too, at Lilypons Nursery , in Lilypons, Md., the country's largest wholesale and retail aquatic mail-order supplier. Charles Thomas, the president of Lilypons, said that in 1989 the company sold some 22,000 bunches of Anacharis, the submerged plant species used in home ponds, to local customers alone. Last year, in the same area, more than 33,000 bunches were sold.</p>
        <p>"Water gardening is being transformed from a narrow niche in the landscape industry to more of a major role," said Mr. Thomas, whose grandfather founded Lilypons in 1917. "New pond materials have revolutionized this business. They are less expensive, easier to install, and there's no problem with cracking. A concrete pool is no longer required."</p>
        <p>Modern pond materials include not only concrete but the newer bentonite mix, which becomes claylike after being blended with water and soil, and prefabricated fiberglass tubs that are said to last a lifetime. These come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, with prices ranging from about $140 for a 3-by-4-foot free-form pond that is 12 inches deep to about $1,000 for a 7-by-13-foot pond that is 17 inches deep.</p>
        <p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and black synthetic rubber sheeting, which have an average life span of 10 to 25 years, provide more design flexibility. An 8-by-13-foot sheet, which can be molded into any shape desired, costs about $120.</p>
        <p>It was this assortment of easily installed pools that appealed to James Johnson. A Brooklyn landscape designer, Mr. Johnson had been asked to add a pond last spring to a brownstone garden in Park Slope, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>"The client insisted on a water feature," he said, "although I was concerned at first since the entire garden measures only about 20 by 40 feet."</p>
        <p>He opted for a 1 1/2-by-3 1/2-foot long kidney-shaped pool of fiberglass. This 55-gallon water garden now seems comfortably at home tucked beneath a bluestone patio and planted with a fragrant waterlily, Rose Arey, a variegated sweet flag, a dwarf lotus, and several bunches of underwater species that he purchased from Waterford Gardens in Saddle River, N.J. The cost of the pond and plants was about $300, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Space was not a problem for Jeffrey S. Rubin, a dentist who lives in Eaton's Neck, L.I., near Northport, where he has two acres of land. Dr. Rubin decided to add a water garden in 1989. It is nearly 75 feet long.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to bring the natural sounds of water into my landscape and attract the wildlife typical of ponds and streams," he said.</p>
        <p>Using heavy PVC liners and special bonding glue from Scherer's Nursery, he and his wife, Deborah, began by installing a 10-foot-diameter, 15-inch-deep pond. They located it in a gently sloped portion of the site suggested by Kathleen Cullen, their landscape designer. Some 40 feet away and 12 feet lower, thanks to the natural incline, they added a second pond 3 feet deep and about 25 feet across.</p>
        <p>The ponds are linked by a 2-foot-wide, 40-foot-long meandering stream replete with waterfalls created by several tons of carefully positioned rocks of varied sizes. These boulders, along with bog plants like horsetails, pickerel rush and cattails, and other shoreline aquatic species, also hide the edges of the PVC liner.</p>
        <p>"We worked with a tractor, dolly and crowbar, and positioned each and every stone," Dr. Rubin said. "But since I'm still changing my mind, I still consider this water landscape a 'work in progress.' " He estimated that he had spent between $4,000 and $5,000 on the sheeting, stones, tubing, waterfall, fish and pond and shore plantings.</p>
        <p>A discreetly positioned pump recirculates the water from the bottom pond to the top. The specially ordered pump the Rubins chose is unusually large, recirculating 3,000 gallons per hour; more typical for backyard ponds are the units that recirculate 100 to 1,200 gallons. These range in price from $50 to $150.</p>
        <p>Water gardens vary widely in size, and at the smallest extreme is the brewery barrel used by Karen Fausch, editor of Metropolitan Gardener, a newsletter for city dwellers. Despite the limits imposed by her 15-by-20-foot patio in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, Ms. Fausch dreamed of having a "pond and waterlily to gaze at."</p>
        <p>Last year she bought half of a brewery barrel with a diameter of about 18 inches from an upstate vineyard. She placed it in the sunniest spot she had. Now home to a single waterlily, Marliac Carnea, and a couple of bunches of submerged species that she purchased by mail from Lilypons Water Gardens, it is "certainly the poor man's water garden," she said.</p>
