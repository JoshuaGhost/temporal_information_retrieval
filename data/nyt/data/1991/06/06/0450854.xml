        <p>The Buick Classic, which begins on Thursday at the Westchester Country Club, boasts one of the strongest fields of the year on the PGA Tour, tall trees and deep rough that make it an ideal tuneup for next week's United States Open, and America's first look at the renovated Seve Ballesteros.</p>
        <p>Only a few of the world's top players are skipping this year's event, most notably Masters champion Ian Woosnam and the tour's leading money winner, Corey Pavin. Otherwise, the 156-man field will include names like Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Jose-Maria Olazabal and Paul Azinger, as they prepare to peak for the Open at the Hazeltine National Golf Course in Chaska, Minn., next week.</p>
        <p>"I think this course is a perfect test before the Open," said Azinger, who finished second to Hale Irwin here last year. "After this week, Hazeltine won't appear frighteningly narrow."</p>
        <p>Ballesteros, who won here in 1983 and 1988, says he loves the 6,779-yard Westchester course, which was designed in 1922 by Walter J. Travis. But little more than a month ago, the Spaniard, who has won five major championships, looked as if he would be anything but a favorite here.  Through this year's Masters, Ballesteros had not won a tournament since March 1990, and at the age of 34, he seemed on his way out as a major force in the game.</p>
        <p>But beginning with the Chunichi Crowns in Japan six weeks ago, Ballesteros has won three of his last four tournaments, and finished second in the other. Last week at the Dunhill British Masters, he won by three shots after leading by seven through three rounds.</p>
        <p>For Ballesteros, who has won 63 tournaments worldwide, the run represents as hot a streak as he has ever put together in his 18-year professional career. And what's most amazing is that it comes after the longest drought of his career.</p>
        <p>"I was having some doubts about coming back as good as before," admitted a relaxed Ballesteros today.  "But the way I'm playing at the moment is as good, or better, than a few years back.</p>
        <p>During his slump, observers wondered if the combination of a long globe-trotting career, wealth, marriage and the birth of his first child last August, had dimmed Ballesteros' inner fire. Ballesteros, however, always maintained that he was simply in a down cycle.</p>
        <p>"My son being born was a change for the better," he said. "Now I always look forward to seeing him after the round no matter what I shoot. It helps a lot.</p>
        <p>"I never really questioned if I could come back and win again. It was a question of when. But it comes a little quicker than I expected."  Changing Equipment and Swing</p>
        <p>Indeed, the dramatic change in form was sudden. After a tie for 22d at the Masters, Ballesteros flew to Japan for two tournaments. There, he worked with swing instructor David Leadbetter on reducing his hip turn on the backswing. He also began using a metal-headed, graphite-shafted driver for the first time, as well as switching to a new putter.</p>
        <p>Ballesteros finished third at the Japan Open, then the next week holed a 30-foot putt on the 72d hole at the Chunichi Crowns to beat Roger Mackay of Australia for his first victory in more than 13 months. "That putt meant a great deal," Ballesteros said. "It gave me back my confidence."</p>
        <p>The next week at the Spanish Open, Ballesteros tied with Eduardo Romero in regulation before losing on the seventh hole of sudden death. He took a week off, then won the Volvo PGA Championship and the Dunhill in consecutive weeks.</p>
        <p>"Those were emotional victories for him, I'm sure," said Azinger. "I'm glad he's playing better. You don't want to see a player as good as Seve go into a tailspin and not come out of it. He's too young for that."  Confidence Building</p>
        <p>In his revival, Ballesteros has alleviated what had become his two biggest weaknesses: driving and putting. He said the swing change he made with Leadbetter had kept him from hooking the ball into trouble so often, and his new putter, a flanged model similar to the one Woosnam switched to in winning the Masters, had got him holing out like the legendary wizard of old.</p>
        <p>Ballesteros said he intended to do well along the narrow fairways of Westchester. But his real goal here will be to have the confidence to win the major championship a week later that would bring him the highlight of his career.</p>
        <p>"In the U.S. Open, you have to play like a robot," said Ballesteros, whose best finish in that event was a third in 1987. "I think there is too much penalty for missing the fairway. But at the moment, I'm driving the ball very straight and putting very good. Yes, I would really like very much to win the U.S. Open."  GOLF</p>
