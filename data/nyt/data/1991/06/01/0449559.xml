        <p>People interested in surveying new inventions can choose between two conventions, one taking place in New York this weekend and the other in Crystal City, Va., next week. Admission to both is free.</p>
        <p>International Inventors Affiliates Ltd., a group that sponsors trade shows to promote licensing deals between inventors and potential investors, is holding an exposition at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center through Monday.</p>
        <p>The Patent and Trademark Office will sponsor its annual Inventors' Expo at its Virginia offices next Saturday and Sunday. It typically involves a wide range of independent and corporate inventors. In contrast to the Inventors Affiliates trade show, the Patent Office does not permit deal-making at its show.</p>
