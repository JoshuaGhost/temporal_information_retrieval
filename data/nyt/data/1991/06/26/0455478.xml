        <p>As an estates and trusts lawyer, Josh Rubenstein learned never to discuss something as crass as death's inevitability. To well-heeled clients, he says, "Should you someday die. . . ."</p>
        <p>This expert in tying up loose financial ends for handsome fees at the Manhattan firm of Rosenman &amp; Colin also advises people whose lives seem nothing but loose ends. He gives free counseling on estate planning to people with AIDS. As the epidemic spreads, these clients are now mostly poor women.</p>
        <p>Most own next to nothing -- at most, a tiny insurance policy or a minuscule pension from a long-ago civil service job. They would never have considered writing a will had this bit of charity not come along. But a will, it turns out, can give them what they most desire: a chance to die with a modicum of dignity and some say over their children's future.</p>
        <p>The great majority have a number of children, almost always by a number of fathers. Marriage might or might not have been involved. Some desperately want to keep one or more fathers from their children, while welcoming the participation of others. It adds up to a tangled legal job -- worlds different from, say, determining what investments are safest from estate taxes.</p>
        <p>And no place for politely evasive talk. Clients have died days after signing their wills. "You can't afford the luxury of 'what if's,' " Mr. Rubenstein said.</p>
        <p>He and seven colleagues take turns journeying to downtown Brooklyn to meet clients in the nondescript offices of South Brooklyn Legal Services, a neighborhood operation that represents people who otherwise couldn't afford it.</p>
        <p>On the condition that last names wouldn't be used, a reporter was allowed to sit in. Deborah, wearing a white baseball cap, was first. Mr. Rubenstein greeted her warmly, warmly complimented her daughter Sandra on pictures she had just colored and said he had "a whole bunch of documents." He paused, then continued, "The first one is your will."</p>
        <p>Deborah nodded, and listened. Two of her seven children were fathered by a man to whom she is still married. If her death precedes his, he has a legal right to his children -- something that Deborah is determined to forestall. Mr. Rubenstein read some flowery legalese describing the husband's abandonment and failure to support his family.</p>
        <p>"Let him try to overcome that burden," he said.</p>
        <p>Then came a long series of documents intended to parcel the children out to different guardians while Deborah is still alive. This has become increasingly common: if the mother can explain and defend her choices, she has a better chance of prevailing in court.</p>
        <p>Many women with AIDS are unwilling to do this, regardless of the tactic's effectiveness. "Emotionally, the children are pretty much all they have left," said Lauren Shapiro, a Brooklyn Legal Services lawyer who works with AIDS patients.</p>
        <p>But Deborah began signing the guardianship papers with machine-like efficiency. She moved on to a living will, allowing a friend to pull the plug from life-support equipment if she can no longer function. This is becoming more important: as AIDS patients live longer, dementia diminishes the ability of many to make decisions.</p>
        <p>There were health care proxies, powers of attorney, about three inches of stuff altogether. Deborah signed and Sandra colored. Finally, Deborah looked up. "You're a testate now," the lawyer said. "That means you have a will."</p>
        <p>Sometimes there is something unusual about a particular client. One woman, for example, was adamant about wanting to be buried with white fingernails in a white gown in a white coffin. But most estate planning sessions are pretty predictable and pretty sad.</p>
        <p>Janet cried as she told about her estranged husband, the father of their three children, being in jail. "He's a mean person," she said. "He has killed and everything else. He's coming out soon."</p>
        <p>The light of her life, the man with whom she has spent six years, is Ivan. "I'll be honest with you," she said: "when I met Ivan I was living in an abandoned building with my kids."</p>
        <p>He helped her find an apartment and put up $575 for the deposit and rent. When Ivan, a butcher, found out she had AIDS, he walked on his knees to a church three blocks away to pray. They had no children together. "I wanted to give him one, but it was impossible," Janet sobbed.</p>
        <p>"This man has been through hell with me," she continued. "He says he will stick to the last day."</p>
        <p>She signed her mountain of papers, smiling ever more broadly. "I could die in peace if I knew Ivan was going to have my kids," she said.</p>
        <p>"We'll get that started for you," Mr. Rubenstein said in an expensive but soft voice. "You're a very brave person."</p>
