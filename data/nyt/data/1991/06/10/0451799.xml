        <p>Outweek, the New York-based gay and lesbian magazine that has been trying to attract mainstream advertisers, dismissed its editor in chief last week after he refused to submit his resignation.</p>
        <p>Steven Polakoff, the publisher, said the magazine needed to become more engaging than it had been under Gabriel Rotello, the editor and a founder of the two-year-old weekly. "The reader doesn't always want to be lectured and bored," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polakoff said Mr. Rotello's dismissal had nothing to do with "outing," the practice of exposing public figures who are gay and lesbian, which has brought notoriety to the magazine.</p>
        <p>"I can say that Outweek would not have existed without Gabriel Rotello, but it would have gone out of existence if he had remained," Mr. Polakoff said. "The magazine is getting stale." Advertiser Resistance</p>
        <p>Mr. Rotello said he had been dismissed because Mr. Polakoff wanted Outweek to become less political. The magazine is considered more radical than The Advocate and many other gay publications. Its articles are often controversial, with arresting headlines like "I Hate Straights."</p>
        <p>"I conceived and founded Outweek to be a political journal that would reflect the very difficult issues that confront the gay and lesbian community in the age of AIDS," Mr. Rotello said, adding, "There has been a certain amount of resistance by advertisers who do not want to be in a journal that reflects the political values that they do not subscribe to."</p>
        <p>So far, Outweek has attracted only a few mainstream advertisers, like Absolut vodka and Remy Martin Cognac. Most of its advertising comes from local businesses -- gay bars, restaurants, doctors and travel agents -- and from sexually explicit telephone services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polakoff said Outweek had a circulation of 40,000. But the circulation is not audited and people at other gay publications said the figure sounded high.</p>
        <p>Andrew Miller, Outweek's news editor, will become editor in chief. He said the magazine would continue to publish exposes and politically aggressive articles.</p>
        <p>"As far as radical, you ain't seen nothing yet," Mr. Miller said.</p>
