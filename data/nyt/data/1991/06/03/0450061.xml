        <p>A man was charged with murder yesterday after detectives saw him in the subway station where a man was murdered a week ago and thought he fit the description of the suspect, a transit police spokesman said.</p>
        <p>"He literally returned to the scene of the crime one week later," said the spokesman, Al O'Leary.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Steven Jenkins, 27 years old, of 300 Lexington Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was charged with second-degree murder and first-degree robbery, Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jenkins was spotted in the 63d Drive subway station in Rego Park, Queens, at 4:30 A.M. Saturday by members of a task force of detectives from the transit and city police, he said.</p>
        <p>The detectives were canvassing the area where 53-year-old Walter Heitlinger was shot to death during a robbery on May 25, Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>They questioned Mr. Jenkins based on similarities between the suspect and a composite sketch that was put together based on eyewitness accounts, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jenkins was formally charged yesterday after witnesses to the murder positively identified him, Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
