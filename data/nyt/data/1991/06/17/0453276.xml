        <p>The Jets and the Washington Redskins remain the last National Football League clubs that do not require their season-ticket holders to buy tickets for preseason games (the Giants recently joined the rest of the pack).</p>
        <p>The Jets' president, STEVE GUTMAN , said, "Our fans have not had great enthusiasm for preseason games."</p>
        <p>During the team's earlier life at Shea Stadium, the Jets were kept out until the regular season because of the primary tenants, the Mets. Thus, Jets fans never acquired the preseason-game mentality.</p>
        <p>"We didn't play preseason games in our own stadium until 1984," Gutman added. That was when the Jets moved to Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Jets have not had a home exhibition game there since 1987. Because of their lack of a preseason tradition, they knew they'd do better financially on the road, because exhibition-game revenue is split 50-50 with the home team. But this year, the Jets will return to Giants Stadium in August.</p>
        <p>"We'll play the Eagles Aug. 3," Gutman said. "That's a Saturday night. We've got lots of tickets."</p>
        <p>And the Redskins? They have been sold out longer than any other professional franchise: since 1966 (excluding one game during the players' strike in 1987). Fans who otherwise would never see the Redskins can go to preseason games.</p>
