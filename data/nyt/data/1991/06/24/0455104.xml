        <p>The Jazz and Blues Jam on Saturday night at the Ritz crawled along, the result of bad programming. Though the idea of the show was sound -- to bring together jazz improvisers and blues stars -- the execution was mostly miserable.</p>
        <p>The show, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, for example opened with Elvin Bishop, a guitarist and singer who plays decent enough bar band rock-and-roll using blues forms but devoid of blues feeling. The invited guest was the saxophonist Arthur Blythe, one of jazz's most distinct soloists but somebody who plays best in a well-ordered environment; jam sessions aren't his strength. The result was restrained, with Mr. Blythe fighting the rigidity of the 12-bar form, his sound never quite emerging from under the electronic ringing of the band. Bar band blues are obvious and loud and their main power comes from excitement; Mr. Blythe was lost from the first note.</p>

        <p>The Jazz and Blues Jam on Saturday night at the Ritz crawled along, the result of bad programming. Though the idea of the show was sound -- to bring together jazz improvisers and blues stars -- the execution was mostly miserable.</p>
        <p>The show, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, for example opened with Elvin Bishop, a guitarist and singer who plays decent enough bar band rock-and-roll using blues forms but devoid of blues feeling. The invited guest was the saxophonist Arthur Blythe, one of jazz's most distinct soloists but somebody who plays best in a well-ordered environment; jam sessions aren't his strength. The result was restrained, with Mr. Blythe fighting the rigidity of the 12-bar form, his sound never quite emerging from under the electronic ringing of the band. Bar band blues are obvious and loud and their main power comes from excitement; Mr. Blythe was lost from the first note.</p>
        <p>After a miserable set by the organist Jimmy McGriff, who played luke- warm instrumental pop using one hand on the piano and the other on the organ -- and featuring the young jazz musicians Philip and Wynard Harper -- out came the headliner, Bobby (Blue) Bland, to save the long evening from total dissolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bland was in fine voice and after dispensing with a few early hits -- "I Pity the Fool," "Farther on Up the Road," -- he brought out the saxophonist Lou Donaldson. It was perfect pairing, with Mr. Bland's gracefully agile and blues-laden voice matched with Mr. Donaldson's knowing blues sophistication. Mr. Bland and his band were magnificent on slow blues -- they reached a sort of frozen transparency, with each instrument claiming a personality -- and Mr. Donaldson would step in, swinging blues and be-bop figures in and around the melody. At times Mr. Donaldson placed an outrageously complicated figure in his improvisations; it had both the band and the audience laughing at his audacity.</p>
