        <p>Have you ever wondered why Luchow's went out of business? It was all because of Roger Rosenblatt and his brother, whose telephone number was one digit away from that of the famous restaurant. When people phoned the Rosenblatt home by mistake, the two young men played an increasingly elaborate practical joke. They would book tables in what they called the Himmler Room and, in the dead of winter, they would ask diners if they wanted to be seated on Luchow's roof. If someone tried to cancel a reservation, they were adamant in their refusal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt confesses this caper in his one-man show at the American Place Theater, using it to illustrate the capacious title of his monologue, "Free Speech in America." Where most humorists would like to be taken more seriously, it would seem that this commentator would like to be taken more humorously. In his professional theatrical debut, he proves to be as adept at lectern comedy as he is at writing articles and books. He appears on the "MacNeil/ Lehrer Newshour" and his essays are published in Life magazine.</p>

        <p>Have you ever wondered why Luchow's went out of business? It was all because of Roger Rosenblatt and his brother, whose telephone number was one digit away from that of the famous restaurant. When people phoned the Rosenblatt home by mistake, the two young men played an increasingly elaborate practical joke. They would book tables in what they called the Himmler Room and, in the dead of winter, they would ask diners if they wanted to be seated on Luchow's roof. If someone tried to cancel a reservation, they were adamant in their refusal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt confesses this caper in his one-man show at the American Place Theater, using it to illustrate the capacious title of his monologue, "Free Speech in America." Where most humorists would like to be taken more seriously, it would seem that this commentator would like to be taken more humorously. In his professional theatrical debut, he proves to be as adept at lectern comedy as he is at writing articles and books. He appears on the "MacNeil/ Lehrer Newshour" and his essays are published in Life magazine.</p>
        <p>Tongue in cheek, bodkin bared, he assails the bumblers, wherever they may be, especially in high places. His mission is to protect our language from abuse. As a wordsmith he takes pleasure in linguistic precision.</p>
        <p>Politicians are his best bete noire.  A favorite Rosenblatt ploy is to have a famous figure hoist himself by his own self-regard. Repeatedly, he catches a politician with his foot in his mouth, as in President Ronald Reagan's comment to the Lebanese foreign minister that his nose "looks just like Danny Thomas's" and President Bush's election year remark that the undecided voters "could go one way or another." It is, Mr. Rosenblatt says, "a lot easier to defend free speech if no one hears it."</p>
        <p>Although he vows to avoid easy targets, he cannot resist Vice President Dan Quayle, whose words, he thinks, were handed down from Groucho Marx, one of Mr. Rosenblatt's role models. He says John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, is "known as the brains of the outfit," and adds, as Groucho said of Harpo, "That gives you an idea of the outfit." An inveterate watcher of television news colloquies, he has a harsh view of those who are eternally employed as armchair experts, like a certain former security adviser who "makes wildly inaccurate predictions." He proposes a movie based on that man's life: Tom Hanks starring in "Zbig."</p>
        <p>The show is high in political protein, but Mr. Rosenblatt is also an avid cultural consumer who can quote Madonna to his purpose ("Free speech is as good as sex"), and he dismisses advertising as something that "fills the gap between greed and death."</p>
        <p>Though he wanders from his theme (free speech allows that freedom), he has a columnist's ability to smooth transitions. As directed by Wynn Handman and helped by an occasional use of visual aids, he employs the simplest of dramatic maneuvers. On the theater's cabaret-style stage, the show remains conversational, punctuated by passing attempts at mimicry: he can be Nixonian.</p>
        <p>The fact that he once taught at Harvard gives him a certain ease at presenting his case in public, but it also leads him into instructional paths, as in his brief dissertation on 19th-century American literature. This mini-lecture concludes with a reading from "Huckleberry Finn," crediting Mark Twain with the clearest example of free expression.</p>
        <p>From Twain to Calvin Trillin, writers have directly encountered their readers, perhaps fulfilling a natural desire for feedback as well as a way to augment income. Mr. Rosenblatt has poise but his timing is not yet on a par with that of Mr. Trillin, who preceded him in this American Humorists' series. At this stage of Mr. Rosenblatt's new career, it is the material more than the manner that draws the laughs.</p>
        <p>The commentary is seasoned with personal asides, especially about his father, who apparently did his utmost to discourage free speech in the Rosenblatt household, a goal with which the owners of Luchow's would undoubtedly have concurred.</p>
        <p>In his 90-minute monologue, Mr. Rosenblatt allows himself a few moments of wishful thinking: a sailing holiday with the model Ashley Montana and, in common with other celebrities, a profit-making perfume of his own, which he would label Roger Rosenblatt's Depression. More accurately, one could call his essence eau de wit. Free Speech in America Written and performed by Roger Rosenblatt; directed by Wynn Handman; lighting, Todd Bearden; production stage manager, Matthew Farrell. Presented by the American Place Theater, Mr. Handman, director; Dara Hershman, general manager. At 111 West 46th Street.</p>
