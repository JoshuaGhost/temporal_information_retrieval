        <p>A man was shot to death outside a Chinese restaurant in midtown Manhattan Saturday evening and another man was seriously injured in an incident that possibly involved Asian gang activity, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The shooting grew out of a gathering of about a dozen men on the second floor of the Hunan Fifth Avenue Restaurant at 323 Fifth Avenue near 32d Street, an area frequented by tourists a few blocks south of the Empire State Building, the police said.</p>

        <p>A man was shot to death outside a Chinese restaurant in midtown Manhattan Saturday evening and another man was seriously injured in an incident that possibly involved Asian gang activity, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The shooting grew out of a gathering of about a dozen men on the second floor of the Hunan Fifth Avenue Restaurant at 323 Fifth Avenue near 32d Street, an area frequented by tourists a few blocks south of the Empire State Building, the police said.</p>
        <p>As the men ran from the building, one dressed in black shot another man who fell to the sidewalk, mortally wounded. The police later found a second man, lying unconscious on the second floor, with a head wound, possibly caused by a blow from a blunt object.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, investigators were still trying to identify the victims and seeking information about what prompted the dispute.</p>
        <p>"As things are now, they're investigating the possibility it's gang-related," said a police spokesman, Sgt. Nicholas Vreeland.</p>
        <p>At about 6:15 P.M., about 8 to 10 men entered the restaurant and requested a table on the second floor, where they were joined soon after by two other men.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, restaurant employees heard a disturbance upstairs followed by gunfire. The men ran from the building out onto Fifth Avenue. Outside, one shot another twice.</p>
        <p>When police officers from the Manhattan South Precinct responded to a call of a man shot, they found the victim lying on the sidewalk, face up, with a fully loaded, .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his hand, Sergeant Vreeland said.</p>
        <p>Lucy Janowska, a waitress from Brook's Coffee Shop at 330 Fifth Avenue, said: "We went outside and this guy was down on the street. A young guy, teen-ager or early 20's, with a gun at his side. He didn't have any shoes on."</p>
        <p>Moments before, said another waitress, Joanne Nunez, a man had come bursting into the coffee shop, yelling for them to call the police.</p>
        <p>"Somebody got shot across the street," she recalled him saying.</p>
        <p>Then, she added, "Two Chinese guys came out of the restaurant wearing black leather jackets and jeans.</p>
        <p>"They ran to 32d Street toward Sixth Avenue. Then the owner came outside and tried to get people to go away."</p>
        <p>The police found another gun, a .357-magnum Taurus revolver lying on the floor inside the Fifth Avenue foyer of the restaurant, and, at the service entrance of the restaurant, another handgun, a .357-magnum Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, they found a second unidentified victim, lying unconscious on the floor, with a head wound. He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition last night, said a spokeswoman, Dina Gabriel.</p>
