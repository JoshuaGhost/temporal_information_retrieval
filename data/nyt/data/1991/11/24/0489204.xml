        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a Sherlockian, an invested member of the Baker Street Irregulars and a devotee of Jeremy Brett's wonderfully precise interpretations of the Master, I must rebuke Mr. Brett for his statement that "Holmes is hollow . . . you must always remember: this is a mind without a heart"  [ "How to Play Holmes? Elementally," Nov. 10 ] .</p>
        <p>It may well be that this vision of Holmes drives Mr. Brett's powerful portrayal, but it is nevertheless incomplete. On this we have Dr. Watson's own testimony. In recounting "The Three Garridebs" (from "The Casebook"), Watson describes Holmes's reaction to a (fortunately) slight bullet wound that he, Watson, suffered:</p>
        <p>"It was worth a wound -- it was worth many wounds -- to know the depths of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time, I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation."</p>
        <p>It is true that Holmes maintained an iron discipline over his emotions, but emotions there were. Reflecting on this, Mr. Brett may further deepen his already formidable re-creation. ROBERT A. MOSS Metuchen, N. J.</p>
