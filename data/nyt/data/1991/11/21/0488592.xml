        <p>Eduard A. Shevardnadze, reappointed as Foreign Minister of what he himself terms "the former Soviet Union," said today that the danger of a return to totalitarian dictatorship was even greater today than at the time of the failed Kremlin coup in August.</p>
        <p>"I would say the threat is greater today than before the putsch," Mr. Shevardnadze declared in an interview with French television. He cited the worsening of economic and political conditions as well as the persistence of hard-line hopes for the revival of dictatorship.</p>
        <p>"The place of democrats and reformists at this moment must be at the barricades," the Foreign Minister declared in explaining why he chose to resume his old post. Praise From Gorbachev</p>
        <p>Mr. Shevardnadze quit the job 11 months ago with a dramatic warning to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that conditions were ripe for a reactionary coup. His warning was rebuffed by the Soviet President, who eventually faced and survived a coup by hard-line leaders of the K.G.B., the Communist Party and the military hierarchy, with Mr. Shevardnadze helping to lead the opposition.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gorbachev welcomed Mr. Shevardnadze back with praise and gratitude, conceding that he had been at perilous odds with his long-time friend and political associate.</p>
        <p>"Our relations with Shevardnadze have passed a serious test and I make no secret of this," the Soviet leader declared in introducing the returning Foreign Minister at a Kremlin meeting of foreign policy advisers.</p>
        <p>"Everything superficial is gone, and I respect his stand," Mr. Gorbachev said.</p>
        <p>Significantly, Mr. Shevardnadze said one of his first new missions would be to visit the discordant Soviet republics that are trying to carve sovereign futures for themselves amid the current domestic chaos.  Visiting Republics'Go to the Barricades'</p>
        <p>While the Foreign Minister's reputation is rooted in the end of the cold war and successful nuclear disarmament negotiations with other countries, he stressed that his new role would stress interrepublic relations, which now are unstable and unpredictable.</p>
        <p>"I could not afford to remain a passive onlooker," he declared in a joint interview with the Izvestia newspaper and the Interfax news service. "We have to go to the barricades in order to save the world, since an unstable Soviet Union is a major threat to peace on the whole planet."</p>
