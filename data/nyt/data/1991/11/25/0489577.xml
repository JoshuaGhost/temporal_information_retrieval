        <p>The future of television can very possibly be discerned in "Sidney Sheldon's Memories of Midnight," and on the whole there's little cause for celebration. Here, glossily inert, is the kind of international project currently being extolled by producers searching desperately for financing packages in the world marketplace. Being distributed in syndication, the four-hour "Memories of Midnight" is being shown on Channel 11 in two parts, tonight and tomorrow at 8.</p>
        <p>The story is a sequel to Mr. Sheldon's 1974 novel "The Other Side of Midnight," which, according to news releases, sold 16 million copies in 55 languages. It was then turned into a completely forgettable 1977 movie. Now Mr. Sheldon returns to the character of Catherine Alexander (Jane Seymour) who, it turns out, was not killed in Greece after all. Suffering from amnesia after a near-drowning, she has been recuperating in a Carmelite convent. Her benefactor is the self-made billionaire shipping magnate Constantin Demeris (Omar Sharif). In fact, as becomes apparent 10 minutes into this epic adventure, Constantin is a ruthless killer who wants to make sure that Catherine's amnesia is permanent.</p>

        <p>The future of television can very possibly be discerned in "Sidney Sheldon's Memories of Midnight," and on the whole there's little cause for celebration.

        <p>The story is a sequel to Mr. Sheldon's 1974 novel "The Other Side of Midnight," which, according to news releases, sold 16 million copies in 55 languages. It was then turned into a completely forgettable 1977 movie. Now Mr. Sheldon returns to the character of Catherine Alexander (Jane Seymour) who, it turns out, was not killed in Greece after all. Suffering from amnesia after a near-drowning, she has been recuperating in a Carmelite convent. Her benefactor is the self-made billionaire shipping magnate Constantin Demeris (Omar Sharif). In fact, as becomes apparent 10 minutes into this epic adventure, Constantin is a ruthless killer who wants to make sure that Catherine's amnesia is permanent.</p>
        <p>As Catherine's memory begins to return, very slowly, the story wanders to glamorous locations: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and, obviously in happier days, Yugoslavia. There are innumerable subsidiary roles, but rarely does the nationality of the actor match that of the character being played. Mr. Sheldon knows how to make a plot take surprising twists and turns, although he seems to have little interest in their credibility quotients. In the end, "Memories of Midnight" is an adventure travelogue, dotted with passing commercials for products and services. The final credits include "special thanks" to a long list of corporate entities ranging from A.T.&amp;T. and Jaguar to the Spiegel Catalog and Warner Books.</p>
        <p>Even if you're bored silly by the movie, evidently you still might buy a little something. The consumer machine grinds on.</p>
