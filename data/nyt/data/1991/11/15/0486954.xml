        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-13 2 CHARGED IN PAM AM ATTACK</p>
        <p>The United States indicted two Libyans in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but said there was no evidence to link Syria and Iran to the attack. The White House all but blamed Libya's leader for the bombing, which killed 270.  Page A1 An inquiry that ranged from the Scottish countryside to Malta.  A8 A SALVADORAN TRUCE</p>
        <p>The Salvadoran guerrilla front said it was unilaterally suspending "offensive actions" after nearly a dozen years of civil war.  A1 CHINA'S LONG NUCLEAR ARM</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration failed to act promptly on intelligence data indicating that China was helping Algeria build a nuclear reactor, officials report.  A1 China hampers efforts against North Korea's nuclear program. A12 GHOST OF TIANANMEN SQUARE</p>
        <p>As China prepares to be the host of James A. Baker 3d, human-rights concerns are already clouding its sense of triumph at luring the American Secretary of State.  A12 A ZAIRIAN CITY CRUMBLES</p>
        <p>Kikwit Journal: The departure of foreign workers has driven a stake into the heart of Kikwit, which had been one of the most affluent cities in equatorial Africa.  A4 SAD EXODUS FROM DUBROVNIK</p>
        <p>About 2,000 refugees left the besieged Yugoslav city of Dubrovnik on a steamer. A woman with a heart condition lay near death in an ambulance on one of the decks.  A3 ARGENTINE LEADER VISITS U.S.</p>
        <p>President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina began a state visit to Washington, boasting that his country had finally put its economic and political house in order.  A3 KURDISH PACT WITH BAGHDAD</p>
        <p>Kurdish leaders say Baghdad has agreed to end a partial blockade of their region in return for a pullout of most Kurdish guerrillas from major cities in northern Iraq.  A9 PRINCE IS BACK IN CAMBODIA</p>
        <p>A joyous Prince Norodom Sihanouk returned home to Cambodia after spending most of the last 20 years in exile with the elusive goal of establishing peace in his nation.

A11 NATIONAL A14-21, D19 MORE BAD SIGNS</p>
        <p>Further troubling signs about the economy emerged: Retail sales fell in October, average earnings slumped, and the ranks of people applying for unemployment benefits rose to the highest level since May.  A1 UNEMPLOYMENT BILL HITS HURDLE</p>
        <p>A bill to provide unemployment benefits to people who have used up their basic 26 weeks of coverage won easy approval in the House but stalled in the Senate. Some senators said their states' workers would be short-changed by the bill's complex formulas determining the number of extra weeks of coverage.  A16 BANKING MEASURE DEFEATED</p>
        <p>The House of Representatives rejected legislation that would have significantly changed the nation's 60-year-old banking laws.  A1 TENUOUS LEAD IN LOUISIANA</p>
        <p>After building an unusual coalition of blacks and business interests, Edwin Edwards appears to be within reach of victory in Louisiana's election for governor tomorrow. But the question is whose voters will get to the polls, and there are more uncertainties about Mr. Edwards's supporters than about David Duke's.
