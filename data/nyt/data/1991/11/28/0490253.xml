        <p>George Balanchine established a dialectic with the music he used in his ballets, and it was this activist response to a score that gave his choreography such a distinctive profile.</p>
        <p>He did not, as his early detractors insisted, merely visualize musical structure onstage with patterns or dancers. Balanchine's genius lay elsewhere: in commenting on the music as he explored it, to reveal aspects that others would not have imagined. The give and take between composer and choreographer explains the subliminal tension between music and dance in Balanchine's ballets.</p>

        <p>George Balanchine established a dialectic with the music he used in his ballets, and it was this activist response to a score that gave his choreography such a distinctive profile.</p>
        <p>He did not, as his early detractors insisted, merely visualize musical structure onstage with patterns or dancers. Balanchine's genius lay elsewhere: in commenting on the music as he explored it, to reveal aspects that others would not have imagined. The give and take between composer and choreographer explains the subliminal tension between music and dance in Balanchine's ballets.</p>
        <p>An apathetic performance can dilute this vitality, but by and large the New York City Ballet has been dancing as if it were were promoting a new brand of vitamins. This newfound exhilaration was projected pungently again on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater with three diverse Balanchine works and "Romeo and Juliet," a pas de deux choreographed by Sean Lavery and seen at the company's Dancers' Emergency Benefit last winter.</p>
        <p>Of the Balanchine ballets, "Episodes" regained the wit lost by an earlier cast. Balanchine choreographed here as much between the spaces of Webern's sparsities as in relation to the sounds the composer dropped into a musical pond.</p>
        <p>Lauren Hauser, helped by Philip Neal's secure partnering, was stunning with her daring emphatic lunges, reaching for height in the lifts and an uninhibited attack that had her covering space as if she owned the stage.</p>
        <p>Simone Schumacher and Gordon Stevens, both making debuts in the "Five Pieces" section of the ballet, made the alienated lovers more than odd. She was earthy, adding a marvelous plushness to the plies on toe; he was sharply aggressive. When they were followed by Wendy Whelan, who was nothing short of terrific, and Albert Evans, who knows how to tie his partnering into the right knots, the dynamic level trebled. It was left to Adam Luders and Valentina Kozlova to translate effectively the resolution with which Balanchine ends the ballet so serenely.</p>
        <p>Balanchine worked long on the idea of using George Gershwin's songs for a ballet, and Hershy Kay fashioned a score for "Who Cares?" that is as delightful as the ballet itself. Judith Fugate, offering something special in a performance that should not go unappreciated, looked like a vixenish innocent, sailing with unusual smoothness through her solo and duet with Robert La Fosse. Partnering Lourdes Lopez, who gave the career-girl role a certain flair, Mr. La Fosse repeated his sterling expressive performance as a song-and-dance man. He was the Astaire to Darci Kistler's phenomenal Ginger Rogers: she seemed, with her skating-style spins and asides to the public, to burst into love right in the middle of Balanchine's big-city romance.</p>
        <p>Balanchine's windswept "Valse-Fantaisie" is very different, and young dancers like Ethan Stiefel and Margaret Tracey have the world at their feet when they move with the elan they displayed dancing to Glinka's waltz rhythms.</p>
        <p>The ballet also has the kind of fluency that Mr. Lavery, a novice choreographer with a fine sense of classical form, might use as an example. Nonetheless, his image of the balcony pas de deux from Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" had obvious audience appeal as danced with purity by Peter Boal and Miss Fugate.</p>
