        <p>It is only when her mischievous side takes over that President Corazon C. Aquino hedges on her promise not to seek a second term in May, according to one of her close supporters. But when she does so, other politicians tremble.</p>
        <p>Six years after declaring her improbable candidacy against Ferdinand E. Marcos, Mrs. Aquino has lost much of the popularity on which she rode to power, but she remains, like her predecessor, the only major political figure in the nation.</p>
        <p>Despite her repeated denials, the question of Mrs. Aquino's candidacy remains the prime political question of the emerging campaign.</p>
        <p>As her term draws to a close, she faces a final challenge -- the accomplishment of a democratic transfer of power -- that her supporters say will help determine her legacy after ending Mr. Marcos's 20 years of autocratic rule.</p>
        <p>"The President is sincere in saying that her best legacy is to have a credible, peaceful electoral exercise," said Senator Rene Saguisag, who served as her spokesman during her campaign against Mr. Marcos. "It is very vital for her role in history and for our growth as a nation to have that kind of election."  'Scary Scenario' Feared</p>
        <p>But like a other analysts, he said he foresaw a "scary scenario" in which a violent election with a disputed outcome could result in the military seizure of power that Mrs. Aquino has staved off during her term.</p>
        <p>Teodoro Benigno, a newspaper columnist who served for a time as Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, said, "This will probably be the most disorderly, the most turbulent and possibly the most bloody Philippine election ever held."</p>
        <p>The scenario is the direct result of the democratic Constitution that was written during her presidency, overturning Mr. Marcos's martial law administration. The Constitution allows an open-party system that analysts say could produce as many as eight serious candidates and a minority president with 30 percent of the vote or less.</p>
        <p>"That will be very, very dangerous," Mr. Benigno said. "The President will be like a clay pigeon, and everybody will be shooting at him. The defeated candidates will protest very strongly and will do everything to prevent the winner from sitting."</p>
        <p>For the moment, what the new structure has produced is a wide-open field of candidates that includes a number of the major players from the last presidential transition, the overthrow of Mr. Marcos in February 1986 after a disputed election.</p>
        <p>Among the candidates is Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, the former Defense Minister who turned against Mr. Marcos and led the military breakaway that touched off the "people power" uprising. He then turned against Mrs. Aquino and was implicated in at least one coup attempt against her.</p>
        <p>Another candidate is his partner in that uprising, Fidel V. Ramos, the general who became Mrs. Aquino's Secretary of Defense and was instrumental in saving her from the coup attempts.</p>
        <p>Also running is Vice President Salvador H. Laurel, who campaigned against Mr. Marcos side by side with Mrs. Aquino but broke with her the following year and has been campaigning against her ever since.</p>
        <p>A dozen other senators, governors and other public figures have joined them as candidates, several of them with a reasonable chance at the 20 or 30 percent plurality it may take to become president.</p>
        <p>Backers of Mr. Marcos, who died in Hawaii in 1989, are now also emerging from obscurity to mount a new bid for power. The crowded field has given them the real possibility of reversing Mrs. Aquino's triumph over them. Imelda Marcos Returns</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcos's widow, Imelda, returned this week from Hawaiian exile to face charges of graft and tax evasion, and immediately began what amounted to a political campaign trip around the country. His children, once seen as the future of a Marcos dynasty, also began to return from abroad, one by one, in preparation for the campaign.</p>
        <p>To mount a real challenge, the Marcos camp will need to overcome a rivalry between Mrs. Marcos and Eduardo Cojuangco, one of the former President's closest and richest partners, who has already positioned himself as a leading candidate.</p>
        <p>The volatility and the unpredictability of the May vote will be increased by another electoral innovation, the simultaneous scheduling of national, provincial and local races that will mean that 52 separate offices will be on each ballot.</p>
        <p>On election day, voters will choose a president, a vice president, 24 senators, 200 members of the House of Representatives, 73 governors, 62 city mayors and 1,543 municipal mayors as well as thousands of members of provincial boards and city or municipal councils.</p>
        <p>"It's going to be a mess," said Haydee Yorac, a member of the Commission on Elections.</p>
        <p>In this context, there is a widespread perception that Mrs. Aquino could be persuaded at the last moment to step forward and save her country from chaos, as she was six years ago.</p>
        <p>Members of her family, who include influential members of Congress, have been widely quoted as saying there is a 50-50 chance that she will run.</p>
        <p>Others close to her deny this. "I can tell you she's not running," said her spokesman, Tomas Gomez. "She's said time and again that she is a transitional President and she is not running for re-election. She most probably will do social work with nongovernmental organizations."</p>
        <p>Mr. Saguisag was equally categorical. "She's not running," he said. "I'm sure of that. She's just sick and tired of trying to deny it, so every now and then the mischievous side of her nature takes over and she lets something slip."</p>
