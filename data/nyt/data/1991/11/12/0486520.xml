        <p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Company yesterday announced that it was forming a new subsidiary to engage in the complex swaps business with large clients, including foreign countries and Government agencies.</p>
        <p>Swaps transactions are used to adjust the currency rate, interest rate or other characteristics of a security. They involve a promise to make certain payments for up to seven years, so only those with the best credit ratings can participate.</p>

        <p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Company yesterday announced that it was forming a new subsidiary to engage in the complex swaps business with large clients, including foreign countries and Government agencies.</p>
        <p>Swaps transactions are used to adjust the currency rate, interest rate or other characteristics of a security. They involve a promise to make certain payments for up to seven years, so only those with the best credit ratings can participate.</p>
        <p>While Merrill Lynch already has a division in the swaps business, it does not have the high rating that the largest customers demand.</p>
        <p>But the developers of the new subsidiary, called Merril Lynch Derivative Products, have structured it in coordination with Moody's Investors Service to obtain a triple-A credit rating. Such a high rating should attract the larger clients, Merrill Lynch executives said.</p>
        <p>"It is clear that credit is very important in big parts of the derivative swap market," said Edson V. Mitchell, chairman of Merrill Lynch Derivative Products. "There are a lot of people who would like to do business with us but cannot because we did not have a triple-A entity."</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell said Merrill Lynch Capital Services, which developed the company's swaps business, would continue to handle the swaps transactions of its current customers.</p>
