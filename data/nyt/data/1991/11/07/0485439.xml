        <p>Robert Maxwell's heirs and their investment bankers insisted today that the family-controlled publishing empire faced no immediate financial crisis and that they would not have to go beyond existing plans to sell some operations.</p>
        <p>"I don't see any change in strategy," said Kevin F. H. Maxwell, who has been chief executive of the Maxwell Communication Corporation and who today became chairman, succeeding his father, who died on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>He spoke in an interview in a ninth-floor office of the Daily Mirror building, where his father had presided over the empire.  Senior Family Member</p>
        <p>Kevin Maxwell, who is 32 years old and has emerged as the most prominent family member in the businesses, talked after a meeting with his investment bankers: Samuel Montagu &amp; Company of Britain and Salomon Brothers and Rothschild Inc. of the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxwell said the family's collection of private and public companies would not need to ask bankers to restructure its billions of dollars in debts, and he was clearly irritated by rumors of a pending financial crisis. He also said he did not think estate taxes posed a threat to the family's control of the group. "I don't envisage any issues of that nature," he said.</p>
        <p>But investor jitteriness was apparent even though trading did not resume today in the shares of the two flagship companies controlled by the Maxwell family, Maxwell Communication and Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. Trading had been suspended on Tuesday. Analysts said nervousness about loans to Maxwell companies caused the stock prices of several large British banks to drop. 'One More Thing to Worry About'</p>
        <p>"It may not be as big a problem as people think, but it's one more thing to worry about," said Julian Robins, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd Securities Ltd. He noted that bank stocks had already fallen in recent weeks as banks informed analysts that their second-half results would be worse than many had expected because of problems stemming from Britain's recession.</p>
        <p>In interviews, several lenders to the Maxwell empire said they were not panicking about Robert Maxwell's death but wanted assurances that the planned divestitures would proceed. They were eager to meet with Kevin Maxwell and his 35-year-old brother, Ian, who together formally assumed control of the group today.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, a lender whose loans are backed by big blocks of shares in Maxwell companies, gave no sign of being worried. This suggests that the American investment firm is confident that the price of the shares will not plunge to levels approaching a default when trading resumes.</p>
        <p>"Those margin loans are entirely manageable in size for us," the Goldman, Sachs spokesman said. "We're quite satisfied with the collateral we've got." The collateral consists of 24.2 million shares of Maxwell Communication and 40 million shares of the Mirror Group. Two Deals Seem Imminent</p>
        <p>It appeared today that the consummation of two deals that had been in the works before Robert Maxwell's death was imminent: the sale of Maxwell Communication's computer books division and of all or part of its 56 percent stake in Berlitz International Inc., the language-product and services group.</p>
        <p>There was speculation today that a $160 million deal for the computer books unit was near completion. And trading in Berlitz's shares has been halted on the New York Stock Exchange, pending an announcement.</p>
        <p>"There are other sales in process," said Robert S. Pirie, president and chief executive of Rothschild. "But I don't think Bob was heading towards selling core businesses and I don't think there's any rush to dump that policy."</p>
        <p>In a statement, Ian Maxwell said that approach certainly applied to the Mirror Group, which he now heads. "We are not going to be taken over or sold off," he said. In May, the Maxwell family sold to the public 49 percent of the shares in the Mirror Group, whose properties include The Daily Mirror and four other British tabloids, racing newspapers in the United States and Britain, two free Scottish newspapers and minority interests in printing and forest-products companies.  North American Spinoff</p>
        <p>Kevin Maxwell said a decision would be announced later this month on how to proceed with a proposed spinoff of the North American operations of Maxwell Communication as a separate company, and to offer part of it to the public. Those businesses -- which include the book publisher Macmillan Inc., Official Airline Guides and Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing -- account for the vast majority of Maxwell Communication's assets and earnings.</p>
        <p>So far this year, divestitures by companies owned or controlled by the Maxwells have totaled more than $1.9 billion. Analysts and British newspapers have estimated that the group has net debts of $:2.2 billion to $:2.6 billion, or $3.9 billion to $4.6 billion at the current exchange rate.</p>
        <p>When asked about the $:2.2 billion debt estimate that was mentioned today in The Financial Times of Britain, Kevin Maxwell replied, "I've seen so many numbers I wouldn't comment on that."</p>
        <p>But he confirmed that the debt of the family's private companies totaled about $:1 billion, or roughly $1.77 billion, early this year. He indicated, though, that this amount and the total debt of the public companies had fallen. "We've gone a long way towards reducing the indebtedness of the group," he said.</p>
