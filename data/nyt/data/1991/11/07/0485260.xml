        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"See the Future, in the Schools" (editorial, Oct. 28), calling for increased resources for New York City's public schools, is most welcome. However, in noting the needs of our school system, you overlook what could be the most crucial: the need to attract and retain the best teachers for our 980,000 students.</p>
        <p>New York City teachers work under some of the toughest teaching conditions in the country, and they do so while earning $10,000 to $20,000 less than their counterparts in surrounding suburbs (who work under better physical conditions and with smaller, more manageable class sizes). Even so, city reading and math scores have improved, and attendance is at its highest level in years. Much of the credit can be given to teacher dedication.</p>
        <p>However, we are rapidly learning that dedication goes only so far, and the patience of our teachers for these inequities is limited. That is why experienced city teachers are leaving for the surrounding suburbs in huge numbers, and also why an incredible 71 percent of new teachers leave the system in the first five years.</p>
        <p>New York City's school system does indeed need more resources for programs, supplies and well-maintained buildings, but the key to education is the quality of that teacher in the classroom. The city simply must provide salaries and teaching conditions competitive with surrounding areas if it truly wants to attract and retain the best and the brightest educators. SANDRA FELDMAN President United Federation of Teachers New York, Oct. 28, 1991</p>
