        <p>Harry Hood Bassett, a prominent Miami banker and supporter of civic causes, died Sunday in Jeffersonville, Vt., at one of his family's homes. He was 74 years old.</p>
        <p>The family said the cause of death was cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bassett was a former chairman of the Southeast Banking Corporation, the holding company of Southeast Bank, which financed many major building developments in Florida. The bank was acquired earlier this year by the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bassett's civic activities included directing a United Way campaign in Dade County and serving as chairman of the board of the University of Miami. He also helped bring together a group of Miami bankers, business executives and community leaders to promote the economic and social development of the Miami area. The organization was called the Non Group, because its members preferred to work quietly and informally.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Florence Knoll, of Miami, and three sons; Patrick of Minneapolis and George and Harry, both of Miami.</p>
