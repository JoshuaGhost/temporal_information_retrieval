        <p>Why is President Bush in such a rush to signal willingness to recognize an independent Ukraine, even before that Soviet republic votes on independence tomorrow?</p>
        <p>Putting out word of "expeditious" recognition might placate right-wing critics. They chafed at Mr. Bush's "Chicken Kiev" speech in August condemning "suicidal nationalism," calling it ill-advised support for a disappearing center. But a rush to grant recognition risks squandering America's chance to promote a Ukraine that is both independent and democratic.</p>
        <p>Before granting recognition, Mr. Bush would be wise to obtain commitments from the new government on minority rights and economic and military policy.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's vote on independence will only ratify what the Ukrainian parliament has already decided. Independence is a foregone conclusion; what remains to be seen is whether residents who are not ethnic Ukrainians support it strongly. If not, that could spell trouble and suggest that Ukraine is subject to further fragmentation.</p>
        <p>The election does not assure democracy. The odds-on favorite to win the presidency is Leonid Kravchuk, onetime chief ideologist of the Communist Party. Local power remains in Communist hands except in Kiev and Lvov. The Council of Ministers, which runs the government, refuses to take direction from the elected parliament, as if still under party discipline.</p>
        <p>Minority rights are also far from secure. Ukrainians justly hold Moscow responsible for their predicament, but too many associate Moscow with Russians, as if no Ukrainians served in the higher reaches of the party or the army. That narrow nationalism makes the many Russian residents of Ukraine fear for their rights.</p>
        <p>Nationalism and a ruble shortage are spurring the government to pay hard cash to print its own currency, called the hryvnia. But introducing it without first bringing the budget under control would throw good money after bad. Too many Ukrainians also advocate beggar-thy-neighbor economic nationalism that can only accelerate mutual economic decline.</p>
        <p>Nationalist-minded Ukrainians are planning for a 400,000-man army -- twice the size of neighboring Poland's, larger than united Germany's and far larger than Ukraine's economy can afford. And some Ukrainians prefer to share control over nuclear arms instead of getting rid of them.</p>
        <p>Americans want a Ukraine that respects the rights of all who live within its borders, avoids economic nationalism and maintains an army its neighbors can live with -- in short, a Ukraine truly free of its past. Hasty recognition forfeits the power to encourage that kind of new country.</p>
