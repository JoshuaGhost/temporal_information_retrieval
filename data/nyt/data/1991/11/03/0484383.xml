        <p>The student government president at the University of Chicago has resigned after allegations of ballot-box stuffing in last month's elections for Student Court and Student Assembly. The elections were declared invalid on Oct. 24, and a rerun was held last week with no apparent irregularities.</p>
        <p>"Some will interpret my action as an admission of guilt with regard to the 'vote fraud' charges recently leveled against me," said George Donnelly in a letter of resignation to the editor of the student newspaper. "It is not."</p>
        <p>Mr. Donnelly, a junior history major from Philadelphia, declined to be interviewed about his resignation or the election.</p>
        <p>In his letter, however, he attacks students investigating the conduct of the October election -- one of whom was his running mate and is now student government vice president -- and says they conspired against him, even as he worked to improve student government. "Frankly, I am tired of fighting for change when at every step I am faced with senseless, personal and spiteful resistance," Mr. Donnelly wrote. Another Election Due</p>
        <p>According to the student government's constitution, an election to determine Mr. Donnelly's successor must be held by Nov. 18.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week, Hanna H. Gray, the university's president, said, "It is an unhappy fact that student government at the University of Chicago doesn't seem to have worked very well in the past few years. I hope students are thinking about how to create a structure that will work for them."</p>
        <p>President Gray added that the university administration would not intervene. "I continue to think that student government ought to be run by and for students," she said.</p>
        <p>In 1987, the president of the student government, Kathryn Sampeck, resigned after admitting that she stuffed ballot boxes while serving as a poll watcher. Last year, members of the student assembly moved to impeach David Medina, then serving as student government president, for spending student activities fees on office furniture, private telephone calls and travel to meetings that the members considered unnecessary and inappropriate. And last spring, allegations of vote fraud in the Executive Council elections, in which Mr. Donnelly won his presidency, led to a short-lived effort to void the results.  Students Pessimistic</p>
        <p>Such incidents have left the student population generally angry at student leaders, apathetic toward student government and pessimistic about its possible improvement.</p>
        <p>"The only people who think student government is important are the few people who take the time to promote the controversies," said William Michel, a fourth year student majoring in economics from Syracuse, N.Y.</p>
        <p>In this year's assembly and court election, the two members of the Election and Rules Committee said they noticed similarities in some ballots notorized by Mr. Donnelly, who had served as a poll watcher. Elizabeth Granados, vice president of student government and chairwoman of the Election and Rules Committee, said that at one point she could tell who was checked off on the ballot "by the way it was folded."</p>
        <p>"All of them followed certain criteria -- for example, the X next to the candidate's name looks like a fish," said Ms. Granados is a fourth-year English major from Chicago.  Ballots Were Marked</p>
        <p>In the race for assembly seats representing the business school, suspect ballots had black marks that seemed to be the result of poor photocopying, and were folded and marked in a distinctive manner, said Victor Rodriguez, chairman of an ad hoc subcommittee established by the Election and Rules Committee to investigate possible vote fraud. Mr. Rodriguez is a second-year graduate student in the Divinity School from Kendall Park, N.J.</p>
        <p>The number of ballots could not be checked against the list of voters because approximately 700 ballots disappeared at some point during the election, said Jason Frank, the other member of the Election and Rules Committee and a third-year student in political theory from Sudbury, Mass.</p>
        <p>Subcommittee members examined the ballots and heard testimony from witnesses who tracked Mr. Donnelly's actions as a poll watcher and decided that they had serious reservations about the election's validity.</p>
        <p>The Election and Rules Committee instituted stricter procedures for the election last week, including the use of paid poll watchers recruited from Inner Voice, a social service agency that serves the near west side of Chicago. Inner Voice supplied poll watchers from among the homeless men and women whom it has trained.</p>
