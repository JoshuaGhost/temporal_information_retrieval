        <p>ADMITTEDLY, the Lipsyte Jocks-Only College Contract Supplement (L-JOCCS) is not for everyone. But for those of you willing to be as tough at the negotiating table as on the playing field, these amendments to a varsity deal can make the difference between a typically exploited and insecure career in the college-based minor leagues and a career in which the athlete-scholar can relax, clock his minutes, maybe even snag some laughs and learning.</p>
        <p>While L-JOCCS is being made available free to all, it is specifically directed at those high school youngsters who this month will be writing the letters of intent that will bind them to the so-called revenue-producing sport of men's basketball at the name-brand colleges which don't pay taxes on most of their athletic department profits.</p>

        <p>ADMITTEDLY, the Lipsyte Jocks-Only College Contract Supplement (L-JOCCS) is not for everyone. But for those of you willing to be as tough at the negotiating table as on the playing field, these amendments to a varsity deal can make the difference between a typically exploited and insecure career in the college-based minor leagues and a career in which the athlete-scholar can relax, clock his minutes, maybe even snag some laughs and learning.</p>
        <p>While L-JOCCS is being made available free to all, it is specifically directed at those high school youngsters who this month will be writing the letters of intent that will bind them to the so-called revenue-producing sport of men's basketball at the name-brand colleges which don't pay taxes on most of their athletic department profits.</p>
        <p>Instructions: Attach two copies of the L-JOCCS to your letter of intent, and stipulate that the letter cannot go into effect until a copy of the contract supplement is returned, signed by the coach or athletic director. (Although University officials' signatures are not presently valid, this is being re-considered since Chancellor Kenneth A. Shaw of Syracuse, when recently asked last week if football and men's basketball would be affected by that financially-troubled university's plan to cut all departments, shrewdly replied: "Why should they? They make money.") L-JOCCS</p>
        <p>1. DURABLE GOODS -- I will not accept any washer-dryers or automobiles without appropriate warranties. Too many blue-chippers and their families have been burned by stolen merchandise or have been stuck driving submarines. Exceptions can be made for VCR's that assistant coaches "forget" to take back after showing the family old Bowl games. 2. A BOOSTER OF ONE'S OWN -- An ardent supporter of the program will be exclusively assigned to handle my legal, financial and social needs, preferably a local business owner who did not attend the college but cares deeply about the image it casts upon real estate and investment. Someone in a cash business like restaurants or dry cleaning would be excellent. 3. THE 'COACH-OUT' CLAUSE -- If the head coach who recruited me, or the assistant coach for my position, leaves for a higher-paying job during my term of eligibility, I retain the option of voiding all contracts with the Athletic Department (A.D.), including, but not exclusive of, quitting the team without losing my scholarship. The same option applies should the school be put on probation and be unable to play post-season games. 4. SEX -- Any "escort" attached to the Athletic Department who promised, during my authorized campus visit as a prospect, unimaginable pleasures if I signed the enclosed letter, will be asked to execute during my first semester. 5. DRUGS -- I cannot be held responsible for any infractions of federal, state, campus or natural laws if I am taking performance-enhancing drugs of any kind for the good of the team. If I am taking recreational drugs, or alcohol, to counter the affects of "team" drugs, the A.D. will be responsible for all legal fees and for keeping my scholarship open during my jail-term. 6. ROCK 'N' ROLL -- I cannot be made to stay in the college dormitories, including but not exclusive of so-called "jock dorms." At my own discretion, I may reside anywhere I wish, with anyone I wish to reside. If the A.D. is mean-spirited enough not to pay my off-campus rent or condo maintenance, I will have the right to rent out at profit the dormitory room assigned to me. 7. FREEDOM FROM THE PRESS -- I cannot be forced to endure local television or newspaper interviews, unless the publicity is specifically designed to further my all-America or other (i.e. Heisman) campaign. I will be allowed to work out my own financial arrangements for Sports Illustrated interviews and covers, and for ESPN profiles. 8. FREEDOM FROM EDUCATIONAL HARRASSMENT -- I cannot be made to spend more total weekly hours in extra-athletic pursuits (classroom attendance, homework, tutoring, etc.) than in team-related pursuits (games, practice, traveling, physical therapy, studying films or playbooks). 9. THE QUOTA STIPEND (for designated minority athletes) -- If outside auditors conclude that the percentage of non-varsity undergraduate minority students is less than half the percentage of minority varsity athletes, each minority athlete will receive a travel and entertainment stipend equivalent to monies spent on his recruitment. 10. FINAL PAYMENTS -- Should I become one of the tiny percentage of varsity athletes to sign a professional contract, the school must pay for the use of my name and likeness as a recruiting tool, to be negotiated with my agent, unless One, I was graduated within five years of matriculation with a degree in other than Physical Education, Recreational Therapy or Social Arts, and Two, I can read this document.</p>
