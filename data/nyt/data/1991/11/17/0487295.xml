        <p>Reaching the summit of Carry Ridge in the Lake Umbagog region of Maine, I searched for signs of deer, my every movement remarked upon by legions of red squirrels whose little bodies vibrated with indignation.</p>
        <p>The ridge was covered with young beeches, but when I scrabbled in the leaves and found only a few nuts I understood why deer were scarce. There was almost no food. Moving downhill, I encountered several ruffed grouse and, something of a surprise, a pileated woodpecker. I became entangled in an astonishingly intricate blowdown in a spruce swamp and when I emerged on the other side 45 minutes later it was noon and time to have a snack.</p>

        <p>Reaching the summit of Carry Ridge in the Lake Umbagog region of Maine, I searched for signs of deer, my every movement remarked upon by legions of red squirrels whose little bodies vibrated with indignation.</p>
        <p>The ridge was covered with young beeches, but when I scrabbled in the leaves and found only a few nuts I understood why deer were scarce. There was almost no food. Moving downhill, I encountered several ruffed grouse and, something of a surprise, a pileated woodpecker. I became entangled in an astonishingly intricate blowdown in a spruce swamp and when I emerged on the other side 45 minutes later it was noon and time to have a snack.</p>
        <p>I found a spot overlooking a recently made scrape -- a place where a buck leaves his sign during the mating ritual -- removed my rucksack and munched on granola bars and crackers. The day was cool, in the low 40s, but when the sun broke through the overcast, its warmth made me sleepy. The previous morning, my oldest son, Steve, and I had risen before dawn to drive from Martha's Vineyard, Mass., to the home of David Taylor in Littleton, N.H.</p>
        <p>In Littleton that night, it became clear that Steve and David, who are in their early 40's, didn't wish to lose any hunting time. They asked me if an early start was acceptable, and we agreed that we would rise at 2:30 A.M. in order to reach David's island retreat -- which is on Pond in the River (the Rapid River) between Lower Richardson and Umbagog lakes in southwestern Maine -- before dawn.</p>
        <p>The last part of that drive was on a logging road that runs south off Route 16 in Wilson's Mills, Me., and for a half hour it appeared as if we might not arrive on schedule.</p>
        <p>When we reached a heavy, locked iron gate on the logging road, an access that is controlled by Maine's Union Water Power Co. with right of passage being given to landowners and others, David looked at us in consternation and announced that he had forgotten the combination. He reassured us, however, that he had written it down on some scrap of paper in the vehicle's glove compartment. Many scraps of paper later a four-digit number emerged, but it was the wrong one. The combination had been changed last summer.</p>
        <p>Clearly distressed, David announced that there was nothing for him to do but hike a mile and a half through the woods in the dark to the gatekeeper's house. As Steve and I fumbled with the lock, David went back to our vehicle and sat in it. A minute later he emerged triumphantly and gave us four new numbers to try. They worked.</p>
        <p>"They just came to me as I was sitting there," he said.</p>
        <p>Before sunup, we were unloading our grub and gear into David's aluminum skiff to make the quarter-mile run to his two-acre island. Two hours later, we were back on the mainland to begin our hunt.</p>
        <p>Carry Ridge was where David and Steve had taken deer in previous years, and we entered the woods separately about a mile apart.</p>
        <p>Finishing my snack on that first day, I arose from my resting place and continued downhill toward the Rapid River, whose tumultuous passage filled the forest with a sound like that of a distant surf.</p>
        <p>David encountered a big doe standing by the river, but does were off limits to all of us because we had no special permits for them. David also got a fleeting glimpse of another deer on the ridge. Steve met a young bull moose during his hunt. The animal allowed Steve to approach to within 30 feet and later followed Steve for a short distance. It clearly had not encountered hunters during Maine's moose season earlier this fall.</p>
        <p>On the second day, we saw no deer but had to wait for a mature cow moose to get off the road. (We surprised two more moose -- a cow and her calf -- on that same road two days later.)</p>
        <p>On the morning of our third and last day of hunting, I told the others that I would use the camp's canoe to get to the mainland so that I could return early and walk about the island. "Camp" is not an adequate word for David's hideaway, which includes a main cabin with a huge living room and fireplace, a separate building for kitchen, pantry and dining room and an outbuilding that houses a workshop. The older buildings have been there for about a century.</p>
        <p>I paddled from the island shortly after Steve and David departed. Ringed-billed gulls were foraging on small fish near the inlet of the "pond," which contains both brook trout and landlocked salmon. I hunted along the river for three hours even though, if one is within 100 yards of it, its thunderous passage drowns out all other sound. The Rapid River, which is without falls, hurtles precipitously downhill in a welter of white water for about five miles between Pond in the River and Lake Umbagog. Part of the Androscoggin River flowage, it is a wild and lovely stream that captured the heart of author Louise Dickinson Rich ("We Took to the Woods"), whose cabin still stands on its northern shore.</p>
        <p>Shortly after noon on that last day, when I was working my way through a tangle of briars and grasses interspersed with young conifers, I saw the hind legs and rump of a deer sticking out behind a small fir. A half hour passed with us both standing motionless -- I was downwind of the animal -- before it moved into full view. It was a good-sized doe. I waited there another hour, hoping, in vain it proved, that a ruttish buck was following her, then went back up-river to the canoe and the island.</p>
        <p>I fired up the wood-gas cookstove with fast-burning spruce, made a pot of coffee, watched the gulls wheel over the wind-torn lake and was content. When night came, I lit a gas lamp for myself and my companions, who arrived a half hour later. Like me, they had no venison, but that seemed of small import. We had been hunting for more than deer.</p>
