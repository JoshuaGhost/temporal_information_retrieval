        <p>TECHNICALLY speaking, they are mammary glands. But few people speak of a woman's breasts in such a clinical way.</p>
        <p>And so it was when the Food and Drug Administration held hearings last week on whether to continue to allow breasts to be replaced or enhanced with silicone implants, a process that has been used with, and for, varying effects for 30 years.</p>
        <p>In the end, an advisory panel for the agency recommended that the implants remain available, but it stopped short of calling them completely safe and urged manufacturers to do more research on their safety. The F.D.A., which usually follows the lead of such panels, is to issue a decision in January.</p>
        <p>In three days of testimony in Gaithersburg, Md., a Washington suburb, the arguments for keeping the devices on the market often centered on feelings. Witnesses linked the value of breast implants to such intangible necessities as self-esteem and the will to live. The panel also heard witnesses blame implants for wrenching physical pain and problems ranging from ulcers to immunological diseases and deformities.</p>
        <p>Some physicians have warned that without the option of undergoing implantation, some women would knowingly live with a lump that could be cancerous, because they would fear treatment might require the disfiguring removal of a breast.</p>
        <p>Those seeking a ban on the implants said that not enough is known about the potential hazards, like silicone gel leaking into the body. They also said that for most of the 150,000 women a year who get breast implants, the surgery is not reconstructive but purely cosmetic. The implants had long escaped examination by the F.D.A. because they were already on the market when the agency was given the authority to regulate medical devices in 1976. That changed in 1988, amid complaints from women who had received breast implants.</p>
        <p>During its review, the panel said it was putting the onus on the manufacturers to prove the safety of their products. But for some women the health and safety issue clearly took a back seat to fulfilling the image of a healthy woman.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that there may be risk in the implant surgery, one cancer patient whose breasts were replaced with silicone-gel sacs told the panel: "I'd rather have quality of life than quantity."</p>
        <p>Some cancer patients bypass the implant issue entirely by having breasts rebuilt with their own tissue. It is major surgery requiring longer recuperation period than the insertion of implants, but perhaps allowing more peace of mind.</p>
