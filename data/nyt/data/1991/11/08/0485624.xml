        <p>N.B.A. Rockets Roll By Cavs  Sleepy Floyd and Tree Rollins led a 28-8 run at the start of the second quarter that lifted the Houston Rockets to a 105-86 home-court victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers last night. Floyd scored 8 of his 22 points during the second-period burst and Rollins added 7 of his 13. It was the most points Rollins had scored since the 1987-88 season and the first time since the 1989-90 season that he had scored in double figures. He also grabbed nine rebounds. (AP) Sonics 103, Jazz 95: In Salt Lake City, Benoit Benjamin had 22 points and 13 rebounds, leading Seattle to a 103-95 victory over Utah in the opening of the new Delta Center. Derrick McKey had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Michael Cage scored 17 points for the SuperSonics, who survived a late 15-0 run by Utah, which was 36-5 last season at the Salt Palace. John Stockton led Utah with 23 points and 16 assists, while Karl Malone scored 19 points before being ejected with two technical fouls with 3:08 left in the third quarter. Seattle saw a 90-74 lead with 5:51 left in the game shrink to 90-89 with 2:17 remaining. Stockton scored 9 points in Utah's 15-0 rally, but a layup by Benjamin and a dunk by Cage put the SuperSonics back in control with 1:39 left. (AP) Nuggets 88, Timberwolves 77: Denver, playing at home, continued its surprising start as Dikembe Mutombo had 14 points and 18 rebounds in a victory over cold-shooting Minnesota. The Timberwolves shot 34.6 percent from the field as the Nuggets won their third straight game after a season-opening loss. Mark Macon led the Nuggets with 18 points, while Tony Campbell scored 18 for the Timberwolves, who have yet to win this season. (AP) N.H.L.  Red Wings Rout Blues  The Detroit Red Wings scored in double figures last night for the first time since 1987, routing the St. Louis Blues, 10-3, in Detroit. The Red Wings' last 10-goal game came against Chicago on Dec. 4, 1987. The Blues hadn't given up 10 goals since Oct. 8, 1984, in a game against Minnesota. Pat Jablonski, the Blackhawks' goalie, gave up eight goals in 27 minutes, and Curtis Joseph gave up the last two. Paul Ysebaert gave the Red Wings a 1-0 lead at 3 minutes 10 seconds and the score stayed that way until Detroit unleashed a club-record barrage at Jablonski late in the period. Shawn Burr made the score 2-0 at 13:20, then Jimmy Carson scored 59 seconds later. Nicklas Lidstrom scored his second at 15:00, and Ysebaert finished the run with his 10th of the year at 15:45. The four goals in 2:25 broke the team record by 57 seconds. (AP) Flyers 5, Sabres 2: Dan Quinn had a goal and an assist as Philadelphia, playing at home, reached the .500 mark for the first time since March 16 of last season. The Flyers (6-6-1) have won six of their last nine games after starting the season with a four-game streak without a victory. Buffalo has just one triumph in seven decisions (1-6) on the road this season. (AP) Flames 4, Bruins 4: In Boston, Calgary's Theoren Fleury and Boston's Brent Ashton scored two goals each as the Flames and the Bruins packed all their scoring into the first two periods en route to the tie. (AP) Blackhawks 4, Nordiques 2: In Chicago, Steve Larmer helped to make goaltender Ed Belfour's home debut successful, scoring twice in a 13-second span in the first period.  COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Aggies Keep Rolling Bucky Richardson passed for a career-high 321 yards and accounted for four touchdowns as Texas A&amp;M cruised to a 44-7 Southwest Conference victory over Texas Christian. Texas A&amp;M (7-1 over all, 5-0 in the conference) is ranked 11th by The New York Times and 12th in the news-agency polls. (AP)</p>
