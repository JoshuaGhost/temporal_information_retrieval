        <p>Pentagon and Western intelligence officials are expressing growing alarm that aggressive new efforts by the Soviet Union to sell weapons and advanced technology for badly needed cash are setting off a new wave of arms proliferation.</p>
        <p>Advanced Soviet MIG-31 fighter jets were on the block at a weapons trade fair in Dubai this month, an American intelligence officer said. Syria is buying upgraded Soviet T-72 tanks, while Iran is acquiring advanced Soviet fighter planes, Western intelligence officials say. The Pentagon is investigating suspected sales of improved Soviet-made Scud missiles to third-world countries.</p>
        <p>As the Soviet Union sinks deeper into economic turmoil, American officials also fear that thousands of Soviet scientists trained in building nuclear and chemical weapons are likely to lose their jobs soon, and then to try selling their talents to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union has about 30,000 nuclear weapons, and American officials say Soviet weapons experts could be tempted by high salaries to join the nuclear programs of nations like North Korea and Iraq.</p>
        <p>"I'm very much concerned about the sale of that technology," Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood said in an interview with reporters today.  "What we do want to stop is their selling arms to countries that have unstable governments or have a history of aggression or a history of terrorism."</p>
        <p>"In particular we want to stop the flow of technology that could later give them the ability to make weapons of mass destruction," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atwood recently returned from an eight-day visit to Soviet military factories, where he and seven American industrialists studied the prospects of American assistance in converting Soviet military industries into commercial businesses.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union has been one of the world's largest arms merchants for years, largely building the Syrian and Iraqi armies, among others. The Bush Administration has made it clear to Moscow and the newly assertive republics that secret arms sales could jeopardize future Western economic aid.</p>
        <p>That may curb official government-to-government sales, but senior Pentagon officials voice concern that thousands of newly unemployed Soviet officers and soldiers, discharged from the shrinking Soviet military, could try to sell weapons or technology in the world's black-market arms bazaar.  Some Superior Technology</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration is torn between wanting to buy a vast array of formerly secret Soviet weapons at bargain prices, and wanting to wean Soviet military industries off their missile and space businesses into peaceful ventures.</p>
        <p>While most Soviet industries lag far behind their Western counterparts, a few others, including space and missile technologies, are equal to or surpass Western technology, American experts say. The Soviets, for instance, have put on sale rocket engines, space stations, nuclear reactors and other parts of their space program, in hopes of fetching badly needed hard currency.</p>
        <p>Pentagon technical teams have visited the Soviet Union in recent weeks to evaluate the newly available weaponry and technology. In a sign those visits might inadvertently be encouraging Soviet policy makers to avoid conversion to peaceful industries, Mr. Atwood this week directed all Defense Department officials traveling to the Soviet Union to clear their visits with him or Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>In addition to arms sales, American officials are worried about the migration of the thousands of experts who built the vast Soviet conventional and nuclear weapons arsenals.</p>
        <p>"We could witness an equally threatening proliferation of scientific know-how, a bidding war, if you will, by third-world regimes for Soviet weapons experts that would dwarf the U.S.-Soviet competition to recruit German V-2 scientists after World War II," Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said in a Senate floor speech this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atwood and American intelligence officials say that there is no hard evidence yet to suggest a "brain drain" from the Soviet Union, but that the disintegrating economy could set off an exodus.</p>
