        <p>THE art world is holding its breath. The outcome of the next two weeks' New York auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art will reflect the current state of what has decidedly been a precarious market.</p>
        <p>Given declining auction prices, the big question is whether things have finally hit bottom. The auction houses are estimating that these sales will total $250 million, as compared to the $358 million brought in last year.</p>
        <p>But even some auction-house officials admit it's difficult to predict the outcome with any certainty. "We're in such a period of stagnation, it's absolutely impossible to tell what's going to happen," David Nash, Sotheby's director of Impressionist and modern art, said recently.</p>
        <p>Christopher Burge, Christie's president and chief operating officer, is more optimistic. "Economic recovery is not what we had hoped," he said, "but at the same time art of truly good quality is doing very well."</p>
        <p>As always in a down market, this is a particularly difficult time for the auction houses to put together strong sales. The reason: private consignors who don't have to sell are, for the most part, holding on to their art until prices go up. Which means, if business remains slow, buyers may be able to cash in on bargain prices for what is on the block. (Impressionist and modern works in next week's sales will be on view at the auction houses this weekend.)</p>
        <p>In addition, distress-sale merchandise is evident. In Sotheby's contemporary-art catalogue, for example, two lots are actually marked "property sold by order of the creditor." Christie's has one such notation. Other works in both Sotheby's Impressionist and modern-art sale and its contemporary-art sale are being offered by speculators who bought these pieces for top dollar at the recent height of the market and are now forced to sell because they are facing financial difficulties.</p>
        <p>But some of the most important art that will be offered at both auction houses in the next two weeks is estate property. In fact, many of these pieces have been unavailable for years.</p>
        <p>This season's sales begin at Christie's on Tuesday evening, with what experts say is one of the greatest private collections of Impressionist and modern art, from the estate of Burton and Emily Tremaine.</p>
        <p>Christie's estimates the collection of 50 works, all fresh to the market, will bring more than $35 million. In order to lure the property away from Sotheby's, Christie's has guaranteed the family a minimum price, regardless of the sale's result. Though nobody at the auction house is talking, experts in the field say they believe the guarantee runs anywhere from about $28.5 million, or 5 percent below the sale's low estimate of $30 million, all the way up to $40 million. Both figures are reported to be significantly bigger than the guarantee Sotheby's offered the Tremaine family.</p>
        <p>What with the delicate state of the market, and the memory of the guarantee Sotheby's extended last fall to paintings from the estate of the automobile maker Henry Ford 2d in a sale that badly misfired, this is a risky business indeed. "I don't like the principle of guarantees," Mr. Burge said. "But this is a two-horse race and we have to compete."</p>
        <p>Burton Tremaine, an industrial-lighting executive who owned the Miller Lighting Company in Meriden, Conn., and his wife, Emily Hall Tremaine, began collecting this century's most important artists more than 60 years ago. The collection chronicles many of the major art movements from 1913 to the present. "The Tremaines put together a very personal collection, buying among the best of what was available," explained Michael Findlay, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art. "At the time they bought many of these paintings, the works were by no means the icons they are today."</p>
        <p>Take Leger's "Petit Dejeuner," for example. A humorous depiction of three nude women set in a vivid, post-Cubist interior, it is now considered one of the artist's most important works. (This is a smaller and earlier version of "Le Grand Dejeuner," a painting that is at the Museum of Modern Art.) "Le Petit Dejeuner" has an estimated price of $8 million to $10 million. Another important piece in the Tremaine collection is "Premiere Disque" by Robert Delaunay, a circle of concentric colors painted in 1912. This is the initial work in a series now considered to be the first abstract paintings exhibited in Paris. Christie's estimates it will fetch $2 million to $3 million.</p>
        <p>Art from the Tremaine Collection will also be the anchor of Christie's Nov. 12 sale of contemporary art. This is not the house's first sale of contemporary art belonging to the Tremaines. In 1988, after the death of Mrs. Tremaine, Christie's held an auction of some of the family's contemporary holdings that brought in $26 million, still a record for a single-owner sale of contemporary art.</p>
        <p>This season's auction features many outstanding paintings, among them Jasper Johns's "Device Circle"of 1959. It is a boldly colored work that is the first of many in which Mr. Johns explores the theme of the circle. It is estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million. Another highlight of the Tremaine collection is Willem de Kooning's "Villa Borghese," on the block at an estimated $2.5 million to $3.5 million. "It sits on the cusp of his big landscapes," said Diane Upright, who heads the contemporary-art department at Christie's. "And it is one of his earliest East Hampton pastoral scenes."</p>
        <p>In addition to the Tremaine paintings, the sale also features a group of smaller, less expensive works that Christie's hopes will appeal to a broader group of collectors. For example, it is offering a Robert Motherwell, "Spanish Elegy No. 17," estimated to bring $50,000 to $70,000; a Frank Stella, "Greek Key" ($45,000 to $65,000), and an Ad Reinhardt, "Blue Composition" ($40,000 to $50,000).</p>
        <p>Sotheby's sales are aimed at attracting a wider group of buyers, too. "We chose the best paintings we thought would sell in the present market," Mr. Nash said. "But what is available is pretty haphazard." Leading its sale of Impressionist and modern art on Wednesday is a group of 15 pictures from the property of the Yaseen family of Harrison, N.Y. (Leonard Yaseen was an industrial real estate entrepreneur). Sotheby's guaranteed this group of pictures for a sum described by Mr. Nash as modest. The star picture in this group is Giorgio de Chirico's "Delights of the Poet," one of a well-known series that depicts eerily lighted, desolate piazzas. It is estimated to sell for $2.5 million to $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>Also for sale are three works from the estate of Wendell Cherry, co-founder and president of Humana, a hospital chain. These include Fantin-Latour's "Still Life of Fruit and Flowers," estimated to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million; Degas's "Danseuse," a pastel over monotype estimated to bring $1.5 million to $2 million, and a large pen and ink drawing by Matisse, "Femme Se Reposant," with an estimate of $200,000 to $250,000.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's sale of contemporary art, on Nov. 13, includes an important estate, too: nine works from the collection of Helmut Anton and Margot Kraetz of Germany, who formed their holdings of German, Conceptual and Minimalist artists in the late 1960's and the 1970's.</p>
        <p>But what experts will be watching with special interest at that sale are the more than 30 lots belonging to the London-based advertising magnate Charles Saatchi. Though not identified as Mr. Saatchi's, these are works all familiar to collectors and experts in the field. Not only has Mr. Saatchi always been a visible personality in the contemporary-art world, he has also been criticized for selling large numbers of pieces by specific artists and in the process devaluing their work.</p>
        <p>Also up for sale at Sotheby's is "Jubilee," an important black-and-white Johns marked in the catalogue "property of a Scandinavian collector, sold by order of the creditor." The Scandinavian collector is Hans Thulin, the 43-year-old Swedish real-estate magnate who was a big buyer at auctions three years ago but is now in serious financial trouble. The picture is estimated to sell for $4 million to $5 million, considered by many in the field as far less than Mr. Thulin paid for it at the height of the market.</p>
        <p>For the auction houses, coming up with the presale estimates for the artworks during this buying climate has been difficult. While experts say the market is back to 1986-87 levels, everyone has a different opinion of what is accurate. "It's a moving target," Mr. Findlay explained. "It's difficult to know what's a realistic price. We do our homework and try to be fair, but we're working three months prior to the sales. If we put too high an estimate on a painting, it scares people away; if too low, they think something's wrong with it."</p>
        <p>Much will depend on who's buying. "We won't see dealers bidding," Mr. Nash said. "They don't have the cash or the confidence. The Japanese are not in the mood at the moment either. And the speculators have completely disappeared."</p>
        <p>Predictions are that private collectors will be buying as they did last spring. "I'm seeing old faces again," Mr. Findlay reported. "Serious collectors who haven't added to their collections in two or three years because they refused to pay the high prices are coming back."</p>
        <p>Moreover, both auction houses report there has been institutional interest, something neither has seen for several seasons. So if prices stay low, some of this art will end up in museums, which will be much to everyone's benefit. Art on View</p>
