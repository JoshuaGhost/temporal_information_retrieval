        <p>The Dreyfus Affair as a parable for our times? That's the provocative contention of "Prisoner of Honor," having its premiere on HBO tomorrow night at 9. And despite some jagged editing, the film manages to be powerfully convincing in its efforts to foreshadow the prevalent dishonor later found in scandals that would get such shorthand labels as Watergate or Iran-contra.</p>
        <p>The star and one of the principal producers of "Prisoner of Honor" is Richard Dreyfuss. He does not play Capt. Alfred Dreyfus of the French Army (no family connection), who was sent to solitary confinement on Devil's Island in 1895 after being convicted of espionage and treason. Rather, Mr. Dreyfuss assumes the role of Col. George Picquart, the new head of French Army counterintelligence assigned to examine the Dreyfus file and determine why he did what his accusers said he had done. Picquart discovers that the real spy is Major Esterhazy, that Dreyfus has been made the scapegoat merely because he is a Jew.</p>

        <p>The Dreyfus Affair as a parable for our times? That's the provocative contention of "Prisoner of Honor," having its premiere on HBO tomorrow night at 9. And despite some jagged editing, the film manages to be powerfully convincing in its efforts to foreshadow the prevalent dishonor later found in scandals that would get such shorthand labels as Watergate or Iran-contra.</p>
        <p>The star and one of the principal producers of "Prisoner of Honor" is Richard Dreyfuss. He does not play Capt. Alfred Dreyfus of the French Army (no family connection), who was sent to solitary confinement on Devil's Island in 1895 after being convicted of espionage and treason. Rather, Mr. Dreyfuss assumes the role of Col. George Picquart, the new head of French Army counterintelligence assigned to examine the Dreyfus file and determine why he did what his accusers said he had done. Picquart discovers that the real spy is Major Esterhazy, that Dreyfus has been made the scapegoat merely because he is a Jew.</p>
        <p>Simple enough, Picquart assumes: exonerate Dreyfus and get rid of Esterhazy. But his military superiors have other ideas. A coverup is put into operation, with one after another of the generals falling into a widening web of lies. They are sure that Picquart is one of them, and will surely come around to perceiving that his true duty is the reputation of the army and its loyal troops. After all, Picquart is an aristocrat and an outspoken anti-Semite.</p>
        <p>But Picquart also believes in something called personal honor. He is adamant: "I will not go to my grave knowing the army has protected a traitor and disgraced an innocent man." The "affair" takes on a life of its own, no longer even concerned with guilt or innocence. Picquart is ordered out of Paris, eventually losing his counterintelligence post to the oafish and incompetent Major Henry. Anti-Jewish demonstrations erupt throughout the country. There are trials and retrials, including one during which an incensed Emile Zola, writing the truth in a newspaper, is convicted of libeling the generals. A crucial secret file cannot be released for reasons of "national security."</p>
        <p>The irony, Piquart muses, is that "I never liked Dreyfus" and "all I ever asked is that the truth be told." That will take years of persistence and pain. The final scene jumps to 1923, when a British journalist has been listening to the story from a man who turns out to be Esterhazy. Sleazily accepting an agreed-upon small fee, Esterhazy describes Picquart as "a man of too much honor," a man decidedly from the last century. It is Esterhazy who is the first 20th-century man.</p>
        <p>Directed by Ken Russell, "Prisoner of Honor" barrels forward briskly, sometimes threatening to reduce essential details to utter confusion. But the costumes and settings (filming was done entirely in England) are quite lavish, and the performances are generally splendid. Assuming a modest British accent and a mien of the utmost seriousness, Mr. Dreyfuss gets huge support from a cast of British stalwarts: Oliver Reed, Peter Firth, Jeremy Kemp, Brian Blessed, Peter Vaughn, Kenneth Colley and Lindsay Anderson.</p>
        <p>HBO has come up with a rare television event: a period piece very much for our time.  New York City Marathon  Channel 7 Sunday at 10:30 A.M.</p>
        <p>From every state in the union and some 80 countries, 25,000 runners will wend their way around the city. The rest of us can nurse twinges of guilt about those seldom-used running shoes in the closet.  'Life Goes On'  ABC Sunday at 7 P.M.</p>
        <p>A new character, played by Chad Lowe, joins the series. Jesse McKenna arrives at Marshall High as a displaced city youth. He's attractive, distant and HIV-positive, a fact that will throw the town of Glen Brook into turmoil for the next few weeks.  'The Rape of Dr. Willis'  CBS Sunday at 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>Collectors of most unlikely plots for television movies will savor this one. Jaclyn Smith is Dr. Kate Willis, who was raped one night leaving her hospital. Weeks later, who should turn up on the doctor's operating table but the rapist? As if things weren't bad enough, the widowed doctor has a perpetually sulking daughter. No matter, Ms. Smith never looks less than gorgeously earnest.  'False Arrest'  ABC Sunday at 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>This four-hour fact-based movie -- it concludes Wednesday -- stars Donna Mills as Joyce Lukezic, a woman imprisoned in Arizona for a 1980 murder she did not commit. Joyce has to cope with a seemingly helpless husband (Robert Wagner), a vicious prosecution investigator (Steven Bauer), a slippery defense lawyer (Lane Smith), and a gang of female prisoners who rape her. Take a deep breath, folks, the November rating sweeps are upon us. Prisoner of Honor  Directed by Ken Russell; written by Ron Hutchinson; director of photography, Mike Southon; costumes by Michael Jeffery; music by Barry Kirsch; production designer, Ian Whittaker; produced by Judith Rutherford James and Richard Dreyfuss for Etude Productions and HBO Pictures.
