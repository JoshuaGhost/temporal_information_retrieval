        <p>The Kitchen celebrated its 20th anniversary with the last of three special concerts on Saturday night devoted to "Five Generations of Composers." It was an avant-garde institution's tribute to itself upon nearly reaching its majority: by traditional avant-garde standards such a birthday would be a sign of sclerotic old age.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Kitchen may have already achieved what any self-respecting avant-gardist dares not hope for: success. The Kitchen's early presentations of the Minimalism of La Monte Young, for example, helped nudge the style into the mainstream; the Kitchen's emphasis on "performance" art and multi-media installations has had a similar effect, and its devotion to improvisatory rock with self-consciously high aspirations even started to inspire programming at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun series. Uptown has taken on as much of the downtown sensibility as it can afford; the nearly out-of-town Brooklyn Academy of Music has institutionalized the rest.</p>

        <p>The Kitchen celebrated its 20th anniversary with the last of three special concerts on Saturday night devoted to "Five Generations of Composers." It was an avant-garde institution's tribute to itself upon nearly reaching its majority: by traditional avant-garde standards such a birthday would be a sign of sclerotic old age.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Kitchen may have already achieved what any self-respecting avant-gardist dares not hope for: success. The Kitchen's early presentations of the Minimalism of La Monte Young, for example, helped nudge the style into the mainstream; the Kitchen's emphasis on "performance" art and multi-media installations has had a similar effect, and its devotion to improvisatory rock with self-consciously high aspirations even started to inspire programming at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun series. Uptown has taken on as much of the downtown sensibility as it can afford; the nearly out-of-town Brooklyn Academy of Music has institutionalized the rest.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of this, as far as the downtown scene is concerned, sclerosis was much in evidence. Each of the 13 selections on Saturday night lasted under 15 minutes, but most reeked of cliches and mannerisms. Some works seemed almost dodderingly quaint. In a theater piece called "Flame Throwers" (1991), for example, a musician known simply as Fast Forward played some hard rock on a DAT Walkman while thrashing about on the floor in a pile of old hubcaps.</p>
        <p>Then there was La Monte Young's minimalist theater piece "Composition 1991 $100" (1991), in which the founder of the Kitchen's music program and the host of the evening, Rhys Chatham, met the composer in the center of the stage and handed him an envelope, presumably with a $100 payment enclosed.</p>
        <p>There were also hints of what for the downtown avant-garde is now mythic prehistory: the 1960's counterculture. A theater piece, "Gong/Ear," recalled the period's taste for Eastern ritual and solemn piety: Philip Corner sounded two amplified Oriental gongs in varied attacks, intently listening to their beats and timbres as the dancer Phoebe Neville stretched in response. And Blue Gene Tyranny, who commemorates an era even in his adopted name, played a delicate improvisatory jazz piece, "Refrain No. 4," on the familiar acoustic piano, sounding less avant-garde than retro. Even Oliver Lake's jazz performance on a soprano saxophone, accompanied by an electronic tape, seemed, in its steady dissolution into fury and dissonance and noise, a throwback to a time when such gestures were thought profoundly honest and revelatory.</p>
        <p>Other works took on the mannerisms of 1970's and 80's punk, using amplified instruments to deliberately strain at the borders of ugliness. John Zorn presented a composition called "The Golem," which consisted of painful assaulting outbursts of his amplified saxophone and an accompanying electric guitar. Elliott Sharp used an "electrified" bass clarinet in "Effector" (1978) to create a sonic texture nearly as violent, blowing into the instrument like a trumpet and improvising raucous razor-edged battalions of sound. Finally Anthony Coleman's "La Monte's Nightmare" (1990), for sampling keyboard and soprano saxophone, was, in its alternation between Minimalism and violent semi-pop, more persistent than convincing.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, examples of talent amid this journey down memory lane. Petr Kotik, in a selection from "Integrated Solo(s)," played his flute into a digital delay system, creating Minimalist canons accompanied by tambourine and trumpet. Ben Neill carefully crafted imaginative vocalizations on a six-valve one-slide three-bell "mutantrumpet" of his own devising in "Schizetude 2."</p>
        <p>David Soldier, in his "Country Dance," played by Michael Swartz, a saxophonist, created Bachian patter that occasionally held the ear. Scott Johnson offered some homey and clever guitar Minimalism. And finally, Shelly Hirsch sang a mercurially furious and perverse text mocking pop vocal songs and bourgeois life in "Power Muzak," composed by Ms. Hirsch and David Weinstein. Tapes of electronic and altered sound accompanied most of the soloists.</p>
        <p>The three-hour concert may have been an anniversary celebration, but it did not leave a feeling of a tradition beginning, developing and promising greater glories. Many compositions were primarily concerned with rebellious play. The only principle involved was the indulgent exploration of extremes: in sound, in repetition, in volume, in concept and in style. A friend said the recurrent obsessions and narrow vision of the music reminded him of how, as a child, he once decided to wax his parents' 1950 Studebaker using Chap Stick.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Chatham, in his introductions to the composers's works, referred to the concert series's peculiar title for the 20-year commemoration: "Five Generations of Composers." He suggested that in our contemporary world, who is to say how long a generation is: Twenty-five years? Five years? Five minutes?</p>
        <p>This concert may have been the embodiment of the sixth generation. Whether there would be a seventh seemed of little concern to the evening's dwindling audience, whose lukewarm response hinted at changes to come in the avant-garde.</p>
