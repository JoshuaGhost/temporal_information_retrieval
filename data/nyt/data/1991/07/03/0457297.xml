        <p>Of all the questions we get asked in the newspaper business, perhaps the most slippery is the definition of news. The wise-guy answer -- "I know it when I see it" -- does not suffice. But in fact it is the closest thing to truth.</p>
        <p>Readers know it when they see it, too. They may ask why it is of particular interest when a female violinist is murdered on the roof of the Metropolitan Opera House, and why it is not when a decomposing body is found in an abandoned building, but intuitively most know the answer. In a city in which there are, on average, six homicides each day, the ones that get more than a paragraph tend to be the killings in which the event is unusual or the victim compelling. In the measure of column inches, their deaths are given more weight.</p>
