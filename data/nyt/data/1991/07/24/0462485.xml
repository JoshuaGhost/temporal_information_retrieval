        <p>In a move that surprised the White House and put new pressure on Western Governments to help the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government has applied for full membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>

        <p>In a move that surprised the White House and put new pressure on Western Governments to help the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government has applied for full membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>
        <p>The Soviet action, which was taken late Monday and announced today by both lending agencies, came less than a week after the leaders of seven industrial democracies endorsed in London a more limited "special association" with the I.M.F. and the World Bank for the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Full membership would allow the Soviet Union, which is struggling to cope with a sharply shrinking economy and a growing foreign debt, to borrow from both institutions. Associate status would only permit the I.M.F. and the World Bank to offer technical assistance, such as the training of Soviet officials and advice on how to rebuild industries and create free-market institutions such as a modern banking sytem.</p>
        <p>An Administration official said today that it was not clear to the United States why Moscow took the action at this point. A Week in the Mail</p>
        <p>The letter, an I.M.F. official said, was dated July 15 -- the day before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union arrived in London. The Administration official said that the United States does not know why it took the Soviets a week to deliver the letter.</p>
        <p>The United States opposes the Soviet move and still agrees with the views of Britain's Prime Minister, officials said. "Our position is as John Major outlined it in London -- that we would favor associate membership status and that full membership is premature," one official said.</p>
        <p>The Soviet application has been sent for review by the 22-member executive boards of each institution. If they approve it, the application would then be considered by all of the 155 member countries of each agency.</p>
        <p>A series of technical details concerning the size of the Soviet contribution to each agency would still need to be settled if membership is approved. The United States, which provides a fifth of the I.M.F.'s money and a little more than a sixth of the World Bank's money and has corresponding votes at each institution, could not block the Soviet application by itself.  Procedure for Associate Status</p>
        <p>By contrast, associate status for the Soviet Union could be approved by a majority vote of the executive board alone.</p>
        <p>An I.M.F. official said a Soviet application to join that institution as a full member did not conflict with plans to offer associate status. Applications for full membership take one or two years to process even for small countries, he pointed out, and the I.M.F. could grant associate status in the meantime.</p>
        <p>The timing of the Soviet application could not be worse from the Administration's perspective, coming as it does just a few days before the scheduled summit meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush and at a time when the United States is interested in giving the Soviet Union things, not denying them. "This letter raises the ante a bit more than we're comfortable with," an official said. "It's a bit awkward for us. The last thing we want to be doing at this point is denying something to the Soviets." U.S.-Soviet Trade Treaty</p>
        <p>At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union were redoubling their efforts to broaden their commercial ties by removing the last obstacle to ratifying a trade agreement that was signed here last year giving the Soviet Union favorable tariff treatment. Mr. Bush has not yet sent the treaty to the Senate for its approval.</p>
        <p>After the agreement was signed, the Soviet Union passed laws on copyright protection that were stricter than those envisioned in the trade pact. But American officials said today that the two countries were working on a document in which the Soviet Union would guarantee that those provisions never take effect and promise to revise them with future legislation. If that commitment is given in the next few days, Mr. Bush is prepared to send the trade pact to the Senate before heading to Moscow, officials said.</p>
        <p>In another issue of concern to the Bush Administration, the United States is insisting that the Soviet Union account for all of its intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe. The White House said today that the Soviet Union misled the United States about how many of these missiles it had deployed in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria before it signed the 1988 treaty that banned them. "This is not a new issue, but it is a real outstanding issue and we continue to press it," said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.  How Many Soviet Members?</p>
        <p>Full membership poses a major policy issue for the I.M.F. This is whether the Soviet Union would join as a single country with one central bank or whether special deals would be struck with one or more of the Soviet Union's increasingly fractious 15 republics, some of which are trying to assert control over monetary and economic policies within their borders.</p>
        <p>Another issue is the convertibility of the Soviet ruble. Although the I.M.F. does not require that a country's currency be convertible for the counry to join, it then makes convertibility one of its first goals.</p>
        <p>Soviet membership in either institution would pose several thorny bureaucratic issues that could take months or years to resolve, I.M.F. and World Bank officials have said.</p>
        <p>The World Bank, for example, has a fixed number of shares, and the Soviet Union would have to find a nation willing to part with some of its shares in order to join the organization. Industrialized nations own most of the shares and have traditionally been reluctant to give them up because their representatives on the World Bank's executive board carry votes in proportion to their countries' holdings. U.S. Blocked Loans</p>
        <p>The United States controls 18 percent of the votes on the board now, and has used its resulting influence to block World Bank loans to unfriendly countries and to push for changes in the World Bank's environmental and other policies.</p>
        <p>The I.M.F. does not have a limited number of shares. Instead, new members are simply asked to contribute a sum of money corresponding to the size of their economy, so that the total capital base of the I.M.F. is increased. New members also gain votes on the I.M.F.'s 22-member executive board in direct proportion to their contributions.</p>
        <p>But the size of the Soviet economy is unclear, because Soviet statistics are unreliable and because much of the Soviet Union's output is of such poor quality that it cannot be traded internationally.</p>
        <p>In addition to the size of a Soviet contribution to the I.M.F., it is also unclear what currencies the Soviet Union would use and how it would raise the money. The I.M.F. has traditionally required that new members pay a portion of their contribution in an internationally traded currency such as the American dollar or the Japanese yen.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union's reserves of gold and foreign exchange are not known in the West, but the country has been borrowing large sums abroad while Soviet enterprises have encountered increasing difficulty this year in raising money to pay the interest on their foreign debts.</p>
        <p>The Soviet economy needs technical and humanitarian aid, a senior I.M.F. official who insisted on anonymity told reporters in April, because it had performed worse than the Fund's worst-case scenario in a major study completed only a few months before.</p>
