        <p>In the latest political turn in the Senate Ethics Committee's inquiry into five Senators, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has suggested that the panel's special counsel has a potential conflict problem because of other clients he represents, officials close to the committee said today.</p>
        <p>But after reviewing Mr. Kerry's concerns, stated in a recent letter to the Ethics Committee, the panel concluded in a private session this week that there was no conflict and that the special counsel, Robert S. Bennett, should remain on the job, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Kerry's action reflects the intense political wrangling generated by the inquiry into the five Senators' actions on behalf of the failing savings and loan association of Charles H. Keating Jr., a major contributor to them. Such behind-the-scenes efforts have helped delay resolution of the inquiry into one of the Senators, Alan Cranston of California, which began in December of 1989.</p>
        <p>People who saw the letter, and who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said Mr. Kerry, a Democrat, had raised the point that Mr. Bennett had clients who were linked to allegations of wrongdoing at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr. Kerry also suggested, they said, that there could be a conflict if Mr. Bennett's clients were called to testify before the Banking Committee because its chairman is Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Mr. Cranston is the ranking Democrat. Mr. Keating's ties to those two Senators and to Senator Dennis DeConcini, Senator John McCain and Senator John Glenn were the focus of an inquiry by the Ethics Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry did not specifically say that Mr. Bennett should be removed from the case, but that he should not simultaneously handle work for the Ethics Committee and his Bank of Credit clients, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Bennett's work for the committee has been completed, and he is now serving primarily as an adviser to panel members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett represents Clark M. Clifford and Robert A. Altman, top officials at First American Bankshares Inc., a holding company in which Bank of Credit had a secret controlling interest.</p>
        <p>As the panel's special counsel, Mr. Bennett supervised the Keating investigation and recommended stern treatment of the five Senators for their actions. He wrote a sharp response to Mr. Kerry's letter, contending that there was no conflict, officials close to the case said. They said that the panel then agreed with Mr. Bennett.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry, a member of the Banking Committee, was instrumental in leading an investigation by a subcommittee of the panel into allegations of wrongdoing at the Bank of Credit.</p>
        <p>Larry Carpman, Mr. Kerry's press secretary, said today that the Senator would not discuss the letter. "Senator Kerry considers this a confidential matter and he has no comment," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett also said he could not discuss private matters involving the Ethics Committee. Poor Judgment</p>
        <p>Five months ago, the Ethics Committee found that Mr. DeConcini and Mr. McCain, both of Arizona, Mr. Riegle of Michigan and Mr. Glenn of Ohio had exercised varying degrees of poor judgment in intervening with Federal regulators to help Mr. Keating's failing Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Mr. McCain is the only Republican of the five Senators in the case.</p>
        <p>But the committee found that Mr. Cranston's conduct may have been more serious, and singled him out for a possible rebuke by the full Senate.</p>
        <p>If the committee had taken Mr. Bennett off the case, it probably would have helped Mr. Cranston because Mr. Bennett had pressed the panel for a strong punishment.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, as the committee was debating whether to send that case to the floor, Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, withdrew from the panel's deliberations on the case, citing a possible conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Bingaman clarified his explanation on Wednesday as to why he asked to be removed from the Cranston case. He said he had learned that the law firm where his wife, Anne, is a partner had represented aides to Mr. Cranston before the Ethics Committee. He said he withdrew from the case because Mr. Cranston was paying the legal costs of those aides and still owed money to the law firm. Mr. Bingaman said he did not know those details until his wife mentioned them to him on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>"I generally knew that the firm had represented some of the staff in the hearings last fall," he said. "But quite frankly, when I went on the committee and began to look into the issue, I was not aware that Senator Cranston was holding himself responsible or had made himself responsible to cover legal defense fees and that those fees were still outstanding."</p>
        <p>In explaining his withdrawal on Wednesday, Mr. Bingaman did not make clear that he had knowledge that his wife's firm was representing Mr. Cranston's aides.</p>
