        <p>Cheb Khaled's late set on Wednesday night at S.O.B.'s sketched the path of rai, a kind of Algerian pop, as it was transformed by contact with Europe. Rai is the music of Oran's younger generations -- cheb means young -- and incorporates electric instruments, but Cheb Khaled showed he is grounded in older styles.</p>
        <p>He is one of rai's biggest stars; the audience cheered the beginning of every song and danced throughout the set. Although rai doesn't call for a wide vocal range -- Mr. Khaled sang almost his entire set within less than an octave -- it calls for ardent tone and precise intonation, so that even the slightest microtonal turns and shakes ring with passion.</p>

        <p>Cheb Khaled's late set on Wednesday night at S.O.B.'s sketched the path of rai, a kind of Algerian pop, as it was transformed by contact with Europe. Rai is the music of Oran's younger generations -- cheb means young -- and incorporates electric instruments, but Cheb Khaled showed he is grounded in older styles.</p>
        <p>He is one of rai's biggest stars; the audience cheered the beginning of every song and danced throughout the set. Although rai doesn't call for a wide vocal range -- Mr. Khaled sang almost his entire set within less than an octave -- it calls for ardent tone and precise intonation, so that even the slightest microtonal turns and shakes ring with passion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khaled's first songs evoked Arabic music; over a sustained chord and the beat of a hand drum, he would sing long, incantatory phrases, answering his own voice with scampering accordion lines. As the set progressed, he put away the accordion and a drummer joined the band. The songs turned into North African funk, with modal bass lines, a keyboard that sounded alternately like an Arabic reed flute or synthesized bells, and an unhurried but danceable syncopation.</p>
        <p>Gradually, more Western touches appeared. The band's trumpeter switched from improvisatory lines to repeating riffs; harmonies changed from drones to chord sequences; the keyboardist started to play repeated hooks; melody phrases, though still full of Arabic flavor, changed to four-bar lengths that sound more familiar to the Western ear. By late in the set, Cheb Khaled was scat-singing along with a bass line. But through it all, the band maintained a propulsive syncopation, without the corny drum-machine rhythms of many rai records. And Mr. Khaled, smiling and dancing, let his voice tease out all the fervor his songs could hold.</p>
        <p>Cheb Khaled is to perform tomorrow in a concert beginning at 3 P.M. at Summerstage at Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street in Central Park.</p>
