        <p>A strong earthquake struck at least two southeastern Indonesian islands on Thursday night, killing at least 21 people and injuring 135, an official said today.</p>
        <p>The quake, measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale, shook the town of Kalabahi on Alor Island 1,200 miles east of Jakarta, said Supriyono, an official of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency.</p>
        <p>The epicenter was off the coast in the Banda Sea, about 50 miles northeast of Kalabahi. But tremors were also felt in Dili on the northern coast of the island of East Timor, about 50 miles southeast Kalabahi, Mr. Supriyono said.</p>
        <p>At least 425 buildings including houses and governmental offices were damaged in the stricken areas, Mr. Supriyono said by telephone from Kupang, capital of the province of East Nusa Tenggara.</p>
        <p>He said 21 people had been killed and 135 injured but added that the casualties might be higher, since "five of the aftershocks were recorded at the same magnitude as the first one."</p>
        <p>The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas.</p>
