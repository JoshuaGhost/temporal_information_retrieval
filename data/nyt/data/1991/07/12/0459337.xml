        <p>Maine's state government, closed last week for lack of a budget, was shut down again today after negotiations on a budget agreement stalled.</p>
        <p>Gov. John R. McKernan, a Republican, ordered the latest government shutdown at 3:30 A.M. after failing to reach agreement with the Democratic-controlled Legislature on new taxes and a reduction in workers' compensation taxes for businesses.</p>
        <p>The shutdown prompted criticism from a top official of a union representing state workers. "They've got to stop playing with people's lives," said Carl Leinonen, executive director of the Maine State Employees Association.</p>
        <p>State employees protesting the stalemate set up half a dozen tents in a park across from the Statehouse, saying their "Union City" was meant to demonstrate the disruption caused by the government shutdown. Most state offices and agencies were closed all last week, idling about 10,000 employees judged to be non-essential.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKernan has said the Republican legislators in both houses will support and he will sign a $3.2 billion budget only if negotiators reach final agreement on ways to reduce the workers' compensation tax.</p>
