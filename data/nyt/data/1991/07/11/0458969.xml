        <p>During her tenure as general director of the New York City Opera, Beverly Sills sought to erode the boundaries between opera, operetta and musical theater, and brought a good many frothy pieces of theatrical ephemera into the company's repertory. Her successor, Christopher Keene, has said that he takes a different view of the relationship between musicals and opera, and has jettisoned the less durable comedies that flourished at the New York State Theater during Miss Sills's reign.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Keene has not banished musicals entirely. This year's schedule includes a new production of Frank Loesser's "Most Happy Fella" and a revival of Lerner and Lowe's "Brigadoon." And to open the company's 47th season, on Tuesday evening, Mr. Keene revived last year's production of "A Little Night Music," Stephen Sondheim's musical based on "Smiles of a Summer Night," the Ingmar Bergman film.</p>

        <p>During her tenure as general director of the New York City Opera, Beverly Sills sought to erode the boundaries between opera, operetta and musical theater, and brought a good many frothy pieces of theatrical ephemera into the company's repertory. Her successor, Christopher Keene, has said that he takes a different view of the relationship between musicals and opera, and has jettisoned the less durable comedies that flourished at the New York State Theater during Miss Sills's reign.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Keene has not banished musicals entirely. This year's schedule includes a new production of Frank Loesser's "Most Happy Fella" and a revival of Lerner and Lowe's "Brigadoon." And to open the company's 47th season, on Tuesday evening, Mr. Keene revived last year's production of "A Little Night Music," Stephen Sondheim's musical based on "Smiles of a Summer Night," the Ingmar Bergman film.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sondheim has developed a sophisticated theater style that transfers fairly easily to the opera stage. But "A Little Night Music," composed in 1973, is an early step in the building of that dual-purpose idiom. So while one can readily make a case for, say, "Sweeney Todd" as an opera, it is difficult to claim anything loftier than operetta status for "Night Music." And the City Opera production, which is sung by modest but forcefully amplified voices, inclines decidedly toward the work's Broadway roots.</p>
        <p>"Night Music" does have its charms, among them the flowing waltzes that give it a distinctive turn-of-the-century character and a sense of unity. Jonathan Tunick's silky French-tinged orchestrations give the piece an urbane but mildly exotic tint. And the show's hit tunes, "Send In the Clowns" and "A Weekend in the Country," are not to be discounted among its attractions. Paul Gemi gnani conducted the music with a sure but flexible hand.</p>
        <p>The production, which is directed by Scott Ellis, suits the tale of multiple love triangles well. Michael Anania's sets, mostly in shades of blue and aqua, offer a cool backdrop for both the clandestine and public encounters, and Dawn Chiang's lighting provides a warm moonlit glow.</p>
        <p>Most of the principals in the cast have returned to the roles they played last season. Sally Ann Howes has improved on her portrayal of Desiree Armfeldt, the actress around whom the plot revolves. She seemed assured but superficial last season, but had greater warmth on Tuesday. In truth, the score gives her only a few moments in which to seem vulnerable, most notably in "Send In the Clowns," but given the opportunity, she supplied the touch of wistfulness that makes the song's point.</p>
        <p>Michael Maguire's portrayal of Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm, one of Desiree's lovers, is an amusingly balanced blend of the Count's military rectitude, foppishness and insensitivity. Both he and George Lee Andrews, as Fredrik Egerman, his rival for Desiree's affection, were more impressive as actors than as singers, but they both gave firm, reasonably attractive accounts of the music Mr. Sondheim gave them.</p>
        <p>Beverly Lambert overplayed both the pouting and silliness of Fredrik's 18-year-old wife, Anne, still a virgin after 11 months of marriage, and the amplification gave her voice a tinnier cast than it had last season.</p>
        <p>As Mme. Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, Elaine Bonazzi's comic instincts were unerring. She delivered her character's drolleries with the understatement they require, and she did nicely with her one song, "Liaisons." Joanna Glushak, making her New York City Opera debut, was a spirited Petra, bringing a powerful, focused theater voice to "The Miller's Son." And Maureen Moore played Countess Charlotte, Carl-Magnus's wife, with the combination of grace, wit and determination the role demands.</p>
        <p>The cast also includes Danielle Ferland as Desiree's precocious daughter, Fredrika, and Kevin Anderson, who played Fredrik's confused divinity student son, Henrik, with tiresome earnestness. The vocal quintet, which occasionally strolls across the stage adding its own musical commentary, included Susanne Marsee, Ron Baker, Lisa Saffer, Barbara Shirvis and Peter Blanchet.
