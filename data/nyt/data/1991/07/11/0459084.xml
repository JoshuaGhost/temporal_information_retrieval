        <p>Ever so grudgingly, Iraq now admits that it was conducting a secret uranium enrichment program, thus tacitly conceding it was hellbent on making nuclear arms. Worse yet, it's still trying to conceal a starker truth, that it has come closer to making a bomb than the U.S. suspected.</p>
        <p>That shocking news, from knowledgeable Iraqi defectors, reveals that Saddam Hussein remains a regional threat despite the crushing defeat that was supposed to have neutralized him. Even a single nuclear bomb in the hands of a ruthless dictator is menace enough. A nuclear production capability, if undetected, could multiply the risk of attacks and of nuclear blackmail.</p>

        <p>Ever so grudgingly, Iraq now admits that it was conducting a secret uranium enrichment program, thus tacitly conceding it was hellbent on making nuclear arms. Worse yet, it's still trying to conceal a starker truth, that it has come closer to making a bomb than the U.S. suspected.</p>
        <p>That shocking news, from knowledgeable Iraqi defectors, reveals that Saddam Hussein remains a regional threat despite the crushing defeat that was supposed to have neutralized him. Even a single nuclear bomb in the hands of a ruthless dictator is menace enough. A nuclear production capability, if undetected, could multiply the risk of attacks and of nuclear blackmail.</p>
        <p>The newly understood danger is rightly prompting the U.S. and its Persian Gulf war allies to reconsider how best to disarm Iraq of its terror weapons once and for all. But the dismaying fact is that no sure-fire method exists. Bombing Iraqi nuclear facilities during the war failed to destroy all the nuclear materials.</p>
        <p>Trying to eliminate Saddam Hussein might backfire. If he feels himself a target, the Iraqi strongman will have little incentive to hand over his nuclear materials. The best answer is to gain international support for more vigorous inspection and for keeping the pressure on Iraq.</p>
        <p>The latest revelations surprised many intelligence experts. Before the war, Iraq was judged to be 5 to 10 years away from a full-fledged nuclear arsenal and bomb-making capacity. The more imminent threat came from 100 pounds of known weapons-grade nuclear material that was checked periodically by international inspectors; by worst-case assessment, it could have been turned into a bomb in a year or less.</p>
        <p>What's new is that Iraqi informants have told U.S. intelligence of a clandestine electromagnetic process Baghdad was using to separate weapons-grade material. The process has already produced about 90 pounds of uranium, some of it highly enriched. That's enough to make a bomb. And it shows that Baghdad is still lying when it claims to have produced only one pound of enriched uranium clandestinely.</p>
        <p>The need to keep nuclear weapons out of Iraq's hands grows more urgent. But none of the three main options look very promising. Bombing nuclear sites, while superficially attractive, is no more likely to eliminate Iraq's nuclear capability than it did during the gulf war. Iraq has been squirreling away uranium and other nuclear material, making it difficult to target. And some of Iraq's nuclear facilities are concealed and hardened.</p>
        <p>Another, facile option is to overthrow or kill Saddam Hussein. The U.S. has tried decapitation and failed. And even success wouldn't stop his successor from building the bomb.</p>
        <p>The least bad choice is more aggressive use of inspections to find and remove nuclear facilities and material. More inspectors might help. So would rewards for informants. And the international coalition can press Iraq to comply by maintaining tight economic sanctions and, if that fails, threatening renewed bombing of military targets.</p>
        <p>Saddam Hussein has to know that the world is ready to resume bombing rather than see him get away with bomb-making.</p>
