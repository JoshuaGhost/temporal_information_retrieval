        <p>Bud Harrelson, the Mets' manager, said today that he had no intention of disciplining center fielder Vince Coleman for his outburst against Third-Base Coach Mike Cubbage last week before a game in San Diego.</p>
        <p>"I'm going to let it ride," Harrelson said. "It was a moment of insanity. I don't think it's going to be resolved by me involving myself."</p>

        <p>Bud Harrelson, the Mets' manager, said today that he had no intention of disciplining center fielder Vince Coleman for his outburst against Third-Base Coach Mike Cubbage last week before a game in San Diego.</p>
        <p>"I'm going to let it ride," Harrelson said. "It was a moment of insanity. I don't think it's going to be resolved by me involving myself."</p>
        <p>Coleman lost his temper after Cubbage ordered him to bat with his properly assigned group. The player cursed Cubbage in front of other players and the public and threw his equipment around the dugout.</p>
        <p>When pressed about whether he felt he should back up one of his own coaches, Harrelson answered by asking, "Well, what if I ask him to apologize and he says he won't?"</p>
        <p>Harrelson insisted he did not perceive his job as manager to include policing disputes between players or between players and coaches.</p>
        <p>"What, am I supposed to solve all problems?" Harrelson asked. "Where is it written that I have to do that? I keep reading about how it's a problem. But I don't see it."</p>
        <p>Cubbage, a mild-mannered assistant the organization thinks highly of, was clearly hurt by the incident, although he has said that his preference is to let the affair drop.</p>
        <p>Harrelson said he had only picked up details of Coleman's nasty demonstration second-hand. He said that he had approached Coleman shortly after the incident but that Coleman had not wanted to discuss it.</p>
