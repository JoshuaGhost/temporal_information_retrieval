        <p>Our son who has Down sydrome has certainly encountered his share of student cruelty in the form of teasing, name calling, ostracism and students putting him up to do foolish or embarrassing things  [ "Schools Try to Reduce Acts of Student Cruelty," June 2 ] . This was much more prevalent in middle school and, thank goodness, seems to have improved quite a bit now that he is in high school.</p>
        <p>A colleague of mine at Sesame Street once took particular interest in Jason, showing him around the studio and taking time to explain many of the technical aspects of the production. He came to me later and shared why he had felt the strong need to spend time with Jason and make sure he had a good time at the studio.</p>

        <p>Our son who has Down sydrome has certainly encountered his share of student cruelty in the form of teasing, name calling, ostracism and students putting him up to do foolish or embarrassing things  [ "Schools Try to Reduce Acts of Student Cruelty," June 2 ] . This was much more prevalent in middle school and, thank goodness, seems to have improved quite a bit now that he is in high school.</p>
        <p>A colleague of mine at Sesame Street once took particular interest in Jason, showing him around the studio and taking time to explain many of the technical aspects of the production. He came to me later and shared why he had felt the strong need to spend time with Jason and make sure he had a good time at the studio.</p>
        <p>"When I was in high school," he confessed, "there was a kid like Jason, and I am ashamed to tell you that we made life an absolute hell for that poor kid. We tormented him unmercifully, teased him about everything -- his learning problems, his looks, his clothes, you name it. Now that I'm older and more sensitive, I feel such a sense of remorse for having made that kid so miserable. I can never make it up to that kid, and I shudder to think of what complexes he may have today because of me. But spending some time with Jason this afternoon has made me feel a little better."</p>
        <p>What a shame that that kind of sensitivity and compassion for others doesn't seem to set in until so much later in life. As a parent, to stand by helplessly and watch your child be humiliated for something over which he has no control is one of the most painful experiences in life. And for the most part, kids in school who are "different" don't want anything fancy -- but only the simplest, most basic elements of human kindness and understanding.</p>
        <p>We recently asked Jason what he'd wish for if he had one wish in the whole world. He answered instantly, without having to take even a moment to think it over. "I wish that people would understand my feelings," he said. EMILY PERL KINGSLEY Chappaqua</p>
