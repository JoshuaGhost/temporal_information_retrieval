        <p>Ian Baker-Finch answered his doubters and, more important, his pursuers today by scoring the lowest nine-hole figure ever shot on the final day of a major championship and then cruising home to win the 120th British Open at Royal Birkdale.</p>
        <p>The 30-year-old Australian, who played poorly near the lead on the final day of the 1984 and 1990 British Opens, was nearly flawless in bursting out today with five front-nine birdies for a 29 to take a commanding five-shot lead.</p>

        <p>Ian Baker-Finch answered his doubters and, more important, his pursuers today by scoring the lowest nine-hole figure ever shot on the final day of a major championship and then cruising home to win the 120th British Open at Royal Birkdale.</p>
        <p>The 30-year-old Australian, who played poorly near the lead on the final day of the 1984 and 1990 British Opens, was nearly flawless in bursting out today with five front-nine birdies for a 29 to take a commanding five-shot lead.</p>
        <p>Still, Baker-Finch -- who has won only one PGA Tour tournament since he joined the circuit in 1988, the 1989 Southwestern Bell Colonial -- had to overcome his strong tendency to fade late. That tendency was most recently reinforced only a week ago when he was beaten in a seven-hole sudden-death playoff by unheralded Bruce Fleisher at the New England Open.</p>
        <p>Drawing deep breaths, he maintained his composure and his wonderfully repeating swing to close out a four-under-par 66 that gave him 72-hole total of eight-under 272 and a two-shot victory over another Australian, Mike Harwood.</p>
        <p>"I must admit that it was difficult visualizing winning, because I had lost so many times," said Baker-Finch, who has finished second or third eight times on the PGA Tour since last year. "But I've been thinking maybe I've finally paid all my dues. I just came here kind of feeling, "Hey, this is the one, boy.' "</p>
        <p>The 31-year-old Harwood shot a 67, but could never get closer than two shots after his countryman birdied the second hole. Similarly foiled were the two Americans who tied for third at 275, Fred Couples, who had a closing 64 in which he holed a string of long putts before missing two short ones, and Mark O'Meara, a third round co-leader, whose 69 was dwarfed by his playing partner's round.</p>
        <p>"Sometimes you get off to a start like Ian did, and it's hard to keep it going," said O'Meara, who lives near Baker-Finch in Orlando, Fla., and is one of his close friends. "But he played a phenomenal round of golf. It seemed like he never missed a shot."</p>
        <p>It was a surpassing performance reminiscent of Nick Faldo's domination last year at St. Andrews in earning a five-shot British Open victory. More than coincidentally, Baker-Finch had been Faldo's playing partner in the final round of that championship, and the Australian said that the vivid image of the Englishman's icy focus had been one of the keys to his recent improvement.</p>
        <p>In winning his first major championship and the silver claret jug that most Australian golfers consider the highest prize in golf, Baker-Finch with his 64 and 66 in the last two rounds tied the record for the lowest final 36 holes ever shot in a major championship, a mark set by Tom Watson in the 1977 British Open at Turnberry.</p>
        <p>His 29 for nine holes, a score he also shot at St. Andrews last year on the first nine of the third round, has only been equaled on the final day of a major championship by one other player, Couples at the 1982 PGA Championship at Southern Hills. (Birkdale's front nine was also the site of the lowest nine holes ever shot in a major when Denis Durnian shot 28 in the second round of the 1983 championship.)</p>
        <p>On a nearly windless day, the 6,940-yard Royal Birkdale links was the most vulnerable it had been had during the entire championship. Finishing early, Jodie Mudd of the United States showed just how vulnerable by shooting a 63 that tied the record for the lowest round ever shot in a British Open and lifted him into an eventual tie for fifth with Bob Tway of the United States and Eamonn Darcy of Ireland at three-under 277.</p>
        <p>Couples had a good chance at an even lower score, which might have made Baker-Finch's road home a much more uncomfortable one. After holing birdie putts of 10, 15 and 29 feet on the front nine, Couples embarked on a remarkable exhibition of long putting. Begining on the 10th, he holed birdie putts of 40, 20, 30 and 15 feet before barely missing a 20-footer for another birdie on the par-3 14th.</p>
        <p>The run put the long-hitting Couples three strokes behind Baker-Finch, who had just bogeyed the 10th hole. But on the 543-yard par-5 15th, Couples missed an 8-footer for birdie, and on the easiest hole on the championship, the 525-yard par-5 17th, he missed a 4-footer after nearly holing his bunker shot.</p>
        <p>Harwood, in the twosome ahead of his countryman, also had a chance to close the gap. The two-time European Tour winner birdied the difficult par-4 16th to pull to within two shots, but pushed his drive on the 17th and ultimately missed a 12-footer, the birdie he had to have.  GOLF</p>
