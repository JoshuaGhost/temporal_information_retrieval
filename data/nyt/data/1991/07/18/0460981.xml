        <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission today announced a $66 million settlement of a lawsuit in which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company would compensate 13,000 employees for job discrimination during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>It was the largest cash settlement ever reached by the Federal agency, and is expected to cause a ripple effect among employers facing a work force with a rising proportion of women.</p>

        <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission today announced a $66 million settlement of a lawsuit in which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company would compensate 13,000 employees for job discrimination during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>It was the largest cash settlement ever reached by the Federal agency, and is expected to cause a ripple effect among employers facing a work force with a rising proportion of women.</p>
        <p>The kinds of policies toward pregnant women that led to the lawsuit were ended in 1978 when Federal law was changed, but advocates of women's rights and others contend that discrimination against pregnant women is a persistent problem in the American workplace today.</p>
        <p>The National Organization for Women hailed the agreement as a major step toward protecting the rights of pregnant workers and altering the way employers view them. "It is absolutely the first case of this magnitude," said Patricia Ireland, the group's executive vice president. "Everything pales by comparison. Employers are going to have to look at their corporate culture and the way they deal with pregnant workers. Even the slowest of the slow will get some heads-up notice on this."</p>
        <p>At a news conference here today, Evan J. Kemp Jr., chairman of equal employment commission, said: "This is a prime example of inequality in the workplace and a perfect example of what the E.E.O.C. is working to eliminate.  This settlement today reflects both the serious nature of our mission and our efforts to set new standards in equal employment."</p>
        <p>Although the lawsuit was filed while Jimmy Carter was President and spanned three Presidencies, the agency sought to portray the settlement as partly the product of vigorous enforcement by Clarence Thomas, the commission's previous chairman and President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, who has generally opposed lawsuits brought on behalf of broad categories of people.</p>
        <p>"Clarence was very much for this case," Mr. Kemp said in an interview. "Clarence had problems with disparate impact cases, numbers cases. Here, there were 13,000 people who were discriminated against."</p>
        <p>At that time, the company required women to take unpaid maternity leave at the end of their sixth or seventh month of pregnancy; allowed them only 30 days credit toward their seniority, while employees on disability received full credit, and offered employees no guarantee of a job when they returned from maternity leave.</p>
        <p>"The company would tell women returning from maternity leave that their job was filled, while they would hold jobs for men who got cosmetic surgery or got hurt in a hunting accident," said Arthur Benson, a lawyer in Kansas City, Mo., who represented some of the women.</p>
        <p>The policies were abolished by 1978, when an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act clarified the rights of pregnant women.  13,000 to Get $60 Million</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the agreement, A.T.&amp;T. will pay $60 million to about 13,000 current and former employees of Western Electric. About $6 million will go toward legal fees. The women are not expected to receive payments until late 1992 or early 1993 after it is determined what amount each woman is entitled to.</p>
        <p>The case recalls the days when schoolteachers had to leave work the moment their pregnancies began to show and companies argued that pregnant women would endanger their health and that of their unborn children if they worked.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp;T. now characterizes its old policies as a reflection of the times. "The practices that came into question were commonplace," said Burke Stinson, a spokesman for the company. "We felt that Western Electric was not doing anything terribly unusual. In hindsight, it's good to get this case behind us after almost 20 years."</p>
        <p>Indeed, A.T.&amp;T. is now a leader in an effort by leaders of the nation's major corporations to work out an agreement on a new civil rights bill under consideration by Congress that would bar discrimination in employment.</p>
        <p>Now A.T.&amp;T., like many other employers, has greatly relaxed its restrictions on pregnant workers. "Women have been known to come into the office in the morning and have the baby in the afternoon," he said.</p>
        <p>But while pregnant women have gained far greater acceptance in the workplace in the years since the lawsuit was filed, many still face discrimination when they seek to return from a maternity leave.</p>
        <p>"Women are having trouble not so much with being forced out but getting back," Ms. Ireland said. "When they take the bare minimum for recovery from childbirth, they come back to no job or a lower-level job."</p>
        <p>That is what happened nearly 20 years ago to Mildred Leisure, a worker in the wiring department of Western Electric's now-closed factory in Cicero, Ill., who became the first plaintiff in the case. She was pregnant with her son Raymond when she took an unpaid maternity leave in early 1972.</p>
        <p>Four months after she gave birth, she tried to return to her job but was refused. "They told me I couldn't just come back to work after a maternity leave," she said. "They said they didn't have to give me my job back."Mrs. Leisure was recalled to work later that year but had lost several months of seniority. As a result, she said, "I was downgraded, bumped off jobs and had to walk off and leave people who started after I did."</p>
        <p>The settlement announced today sought to redress those wrongs. It provides up to three full years of pay plus interest for women who lost their jobs after a pregnancy. For those who got their jobs back, but at a lower wage, it provides for the difference in pay plus interest.</p>
        <p>But the accord does not restore seniority, a provision that affects the women's pension rights and their ability to keep a job in time of layoffs.</p>
        <p>The settlement comes four years after a Federal district judge in Chicago, Frank McGarr, ruled that Western Electric had discriminated against its pregnant employees. Critics of Judge Thomas, who now sits on the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, blame him and the Reagan Administration for the apparent delay in a settlement. "There is the appearance of some taint because at the highest levels there was a clear resistance to this type of case," Ms. Ireland said.</p>
        <p>Commission officials said it took 13 years to settle the case because of legal maneuvering and the extensive research that was required by the courts.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 19, 1991, Friday</p>
        <p>An article yesterday about the settlement of a lawsuit against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company over job discrimination during pregnancy referred incorrectly in some copies to the seniority lost by a plaintiff, Mildred Leisure, and misattributed a quotation. Mrs. Leisure lost several months of seniority, not five years. It was another plaintiff, Helen Shadden, not Mrs. Leisure, who said: "It was either take the maternity leave or be fired for attendance problems. I just couldn't believe a company as big as Western Electric could do something like this."</p>
