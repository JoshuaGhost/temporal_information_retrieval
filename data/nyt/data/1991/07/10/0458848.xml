        <p>Six states have sued TRW Inc., contending that its credit-rating subsidiary secretly judged consumers on their bill-paying ability and sold confidential information from its data base on 170 million Americans.</p>
        <p>"TRW is masquerading as a mere library of credit histories, when in fact it is secretly rating the creditworthiness of consumers," Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York said yesterday. "TRW has a legal obligation to disclose to consumers its true role in the credit-granting process."</p>

        <p>Six states have sued TRW Inc., contending that its credit-rating subsidiary secretly judged consumers on their bill-paying ability and sold confidential information from its data base on 170 million Americans.</p>
        <p>"TRW is masquerading as a mere library of credit histories, when in fact it is secretly rating the creditworthiness of consumers," Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York said yesterday. "TRW has a legal obligation to disclose to consumers its true role in the credit-granting process."</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams's suit, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, also charged the Cleveland-based TRW with failing to maintain reasonable procedures to assure the accuracy of its reports.</p>
        <p>A second suit, also announced yesterday, was filed in Texas on Monday by attorneys general from Alabama, California, Idaho, Michigan and Texas.</p>
        <p>A TRW spokeswoman said the company would comment on the legal actions later.</p>
        <p>TRW, according to the New York suit, receives about 500,000 complaints a year involving supposed inaccuracies in its reports.</p>
        <p>The suit asks the court to order TRW to stop breaking the law, and it seeks an unspecified amount of penalties, restitution and damages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams said TRW had misled consumers by telling them it merely gathered information about individuals from creditors like banks, retailers and financial service companies.</p>
        <p>But the Attorney General contended that the agency secretly rated and evaluated consumers for their ability to pay bills.</p>
        <p>Unknown to consumers, the suit said, TRW offers its subscribers, for an additional fee, point-scoring systems that rate an individual's creditworthiness according to a variety of factors.</p>
        <p>Also unknown to consumers, the suit said, TRW issues one version of a consumer's credit report to subscribers and another to the consumer. The version that goes to subscribers has an easy-to-read summary and, in some cases, credit-scoring information.</p>
        <p>Consumers do not receive a summary or the scoring information, making the report difficult to understand, the suit contended. More than 170 different codes, abbreviations and symbols may be used in a report.</p>
