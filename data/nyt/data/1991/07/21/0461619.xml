        <p>Just whisper about taxes around a stock market and the mood goes sour. Look at the German and Italian bourses, both of which have fallen after threats of tax increases.</p>
        <p>In Germany, a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court at the end of last month requires the Government to assure that taxes on investment income will be collected fairly and efficiently by the beginning of 1993.</p>
        <p>There is no plan on how to do this yet, although the Government appears to have ruled out a new withholding tax. The last one was so unpopular that it was repealed in 1989 shortly after it was imposed. One alternative is to allow the tax collectors to look at bank records to determine interest income, something that is not allowed under current German law.</p>
        <p>Since the court ruling, the DAX index of 30 leading shares has dropped 42 points, or 2.5 percent, and did not rally even when the Bundesbank decided not to raise interest rates at its meeting on July 11. The DAX closed Friday at 1,623.99. A broadening scandal involving the investigation of 25 brokers for tax evasion is also weighing on the market.</p>
        <p>In Italy the tax threat seems more concrete. The Government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti has said it will require companies to revalue their property assets, a move that would lead to higher values and taxes to be paid on the capital gains. Since this plan was proposed in mid-June, the MIB index for the Milan stock market has fallen about 7 percent, closing Friday at 1,104.</p>
        <p>The Germans have been plagued by the evasion of taxes, and whatever solution is chosen could just drive some investors to move their money to tax havens. The Italian tax proposal is driven by the need to reduce the country's serious budget deficit.</p>
        <p>Before the tax fright, the German stock market was already on the outs with many analysts, who were worried about the prospect of higher interest rates, slowing growth, rising inflation and the relatively high cost of German stocks compared with other markets in Europe.</p>
        <p>Some advisers, however, had been enthusiatic about Italian stocks compared with other markets in Europe. But the Government tax decison has reduced this advantage. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company in London concludes, "There is no significant potential performance left for the remainder of the year." According to Goldman, the impact could be enough to slash its estimates for earnings increases in 1992 by five percentage points, to 3 percent from 8 percent.</p>
        <p>But Goldman Sachs does like Italy in the longer run, over 12 to 15 months, when its analysts expect the tax situation to be cleared up and earnings to begin showing some spunk. They declined sharply in 1990 and are expected to do so again this year.</p>
        <p>One factor in this longer view, according to Paul Feldman, a senior strategist, is Italian data showing that domestic money is moving into domestic mutual funds again. This, he said, reflects growing confidence and the possibility that this money will move quickly into the market when the mood changes.</p>
        <p>Combined with the generally low level of Italian stocks in many international portfolios, the mutual fund data show there is the potential for a sudden move of money back into the Italian market. And in light of the market's relatively small size and its lack of liquidity, a quick change in sentiment could push prices up quickly.</p>
        <p>This leads to another Goldman point -- timing. Goldman suggests getting into the Italian market soon to assure being invested when the rally begins. It is an argument that sellers of stocks often make, but it has relevance in markets where lack of liquidity is an issue.</p>
        <p>Filippo Lardera, the Italian strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, is more pessimistic. Goldman, Sachs is recommending that investors "overweight" Italy -- put a bigger proportion of Italian shares in a global portfolio than Italy's share of the world's stock markets, which is about 1.5 percent. Mr. Lardera is underweighting Italy.</p>
        <p>He is especially worried about a decline in the market in the fall when the earnings reports for the first six months of the year come out. He said the comparison for a relative good first half in 1990 and this year could be especially harsh.</p>
        <p>He is a little less worried about the impact of the revaluation of property assets. But he said that if the Government required both investment real estate and operational real estate -- like working industrial plants -- to be revalued, the tax would have a much broader bite.</p>
        <p>His view on Italy is more optimistic for one and a half to two years in the future. The likelihood that the Government will sell state-owned companies to the public -- privatizing -- will attract investors, he argues, and force improvement in both the operation and regulation of the Italian market.</p>
        <p>So when does he recommend getting back into the market? Well, like Goldman, he is worried about the risk of moving too late. So he is ready to consider increasing the holdings in a global portfolio up to 1.5 percent. He is not ready to go as far as Goldman, which has doubled that share now.</p>
