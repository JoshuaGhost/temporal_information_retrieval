        <p>As vinyl verges on extinction, one album has emerged as the prime specimen of the species. Of all the millions of recordings released in the 114 years since Thomas Edison asked, "What hath God wrought?" this album has come closest to achieving the potential of a vanishing medium. It represents "the paradigm," says one audiophile, "the paramount, if you will."</p>
        <p>It is . . . the original soundtrack of the 1967 movie "Casino Royale."</p>
        <p>This unlikely choice -- a jaunty Burt Bacharach score for a James Bond spoof -- makes sense only if one disregards traditional criteria for liking an album. Collectors of "Casino Royale" aren't necessarily interested in the music. "Some people enjoy it," says one rare-record dealer, shrugging. "Some people can't stand it."</p>
        <p>What interests audiophiles is the quality of sound. They swap stories about the legendary recording session in London, spend hundreds of dollars for a pristine copy if and when they can find one, and then, like oenophiles who wouldn't dream of opening a 1945 Lafite-Rothschild, often refuse to listen to it. So volatile is the market for this LP that any nugget of news that enhances its considerable mystique can affect the price -- and some significant new information, about the deteriorating condition of the master tape, indicates that the price is about to rise dramatically.</p>
        <p>The "Casino Royale" movie is memorable mostly as an artifact of its era. The producer, Charles K. Feldman, who had bought the rights to Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel before the movie series became a hit, conceived of "Casino Royale" as the film that would out-Bond Bond. He threw $12 million, five credited directors and a host of uncredited screenwriters at the material. He assembled a cast that included Peter Sellers, David Niven and Woody Allen -- but not Sean Connery -- as only three of the movie's various James Bonds. And he hired the hottest movie composer of the time, Mr. Bacharach, who in turn enlisted Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass to play the title cut.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack, like everything else about the movie, was over the top. "The legend is that the original master tape had 'mad' levels on it," says Harry Pearson, editor and publisher of the audiophile bible Absolute Sound and, by general consensus, the person most responsible for creating the "Casino Royale" cult.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson explains that a sound engineer usually adjusts recording levels so that when musicians are playing their loudest, the meters on the console reach zero. "Once the meters pass zero, it means that you're saturating the tape and running the risk of distortion," he says. "On 'Casino,' they used a supposedly very fancy grade of tape, and the engineers really pushed it, so the meters were typically running deep into the red -- plus one, plus two, plus three, plus four." As a result, he says, the record has an "extremely wide dynamic range" -- higher highs and lower lows.</p>
        <p>"They weren't afraid to push the medium to the limits of the recording process," Mr. Pearson adds. "It can lead to disaster, but in the case of 'Casino,' it doesn't. There's no saturation, no distortion. The record is as clean as a whistle."</p>
        <p>For this reason, ever since the album's release, audiophiles have valued "Casino Royale" as a test for stereo equipment. "The better your system gets," says Mr. Pearson, "the more you get out of that album."</p>
        <p>"The Look of Love" provides several such tests. Dusty Springfield recorded her vocal in a "tiny isolation booth, so on a really good system, you can hear her voice emerging from what sounds like a little hole in space," Mr. Pearson says. "She's not part of of the general orchestral acoustic, and once your system gets to a certain point, you can hear that."</p>
        <p>The song also features a sudden saxophone dip and rise that, on less sophisticated equipment, sounds like two or three distinct instruments, and a serrated gourd called a guirot, whose every notch will sound, under ideal conditions, Mr. Pearson says, "like a tooth on a comb. A normal sound system simply can't reproduce this series of very quick transients" -- stiff sound waves -- "at a very soft level. Just cannot do it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson founded the Absolute Sound in 1973 when he was still an environmental reporter for Newsday, and he tries to apply objective reporting to the subjective experience of listening to music. "Whenever we get a piece of equipment that we think is setting new records," he says, "out comes 'Casino.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson has often cited the record in the Absolute Sound, which has a circulation of 35,000. It is these references that have contributed to the soundtrack's cult status. Other albums are rarer than "Casino Royale," with prices as high as $10,000, and even Mr. Pearson has to admit that "there</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>better-sounding records. But I don't think there's one quite as useful overall."</p>
        <p>Today a pristine copy of "Casino Royale" can fetch upwards of $400. "I've seen scratched-up copies go for $100 to $125," says Ron Saja, manager of Footlight Records, a Manhattan rare-record store that specializes in movie and stage recordings. Footlight has sold "Casino Royale" for as much as $195, though the current price would be $150 -- if the shop had one in stock. "Amazing," Mr. Bacharach said when he heard how valuable "Casino Royale" has become, in an interview with the Absolute Sound several years ago. "I don't even have a copy."</p>
        <p>Collectors, however, take pride inbuying copies for a song. Frank Doris, technical director for the Absolute Sound, remembers finding his first "Casino" in a bin at a record convention. "Eighteen dollars!" he shouted, losing his collector's cool. To which the unwitting dealer replied, "And not a penny less!"</p>
        <p>Those who appreciate the music of "Casino Royale" but don't have the luck or the cash to buy the album can take solace from the recent release of the soundtrack on compact disk (Varese Sarabande VSD-5265). Tom Null, the label's executive vice-president and supervisor of the CD release, has his own "Casino Royale" story: used-record store, five years ago, two bucks. Even so, Mr. Null says, Varese Sarabande didn't send out advance copies of the CD for review "because the preconceived, closed minds of audiophiles made it a foregone lost battle. I knew they're going to say" -- here he slows his voice to an academic drone and repeats a frequent criticism of compact disks in general -- 'The digital transfer added a brightness to the treble.' "</p>
        <p>The problem, he says, was with the master tape -- the oneaudiophiles have spun legends around for decades. Mr. Null knows all the legends, too, and he says he was as surprised as anyone when he played the tape and heard "a certain brightness."</p>
        <p>"Vinyl masked and rounded off the brightness," he says. So for the CD transfer he had to choose between being faithful to the master tape and risking the wrath of audiophiles, or masking the treble and misrepresenting the music.</p>
        <p>"I said, 'Better to be faithful,' " he says. Mr. Null calls the CD "a tiny bit too bright," but he says the sound is "exactly as the producers mixed it onto the tape."</p>
        <p>Whatever its merits, the CD release has sparked a new "Casino Royale" legend only now starting to make the rounds -- that Varese Sarabande inadvertently destroyed the master tape during the transfer. Mr. Null has heard that rumor, too, and he attributes it to a loss of iron oxide that is inevitable when rewinding analog tapes, especially at high speeds. "It might have been done better" using a slower, more expensive process, he says, but he adds, "The significance would have been if there had been a way to avoid it."</p>
        <p>In any event, he continues, the master tape had suffered damage even before Varese Sarabande licensed it -- a similar loss of iron oxide, apparently during an earlier transfer for a foreign pressing. Mr. Null says he located and listened to a copy of that record, and the damage was already evident -- barely audible, but unmistakable.</p>
        <p>For audiophiles, this effectively ends speculation about a reissue of the LP. Mr. Pearson, for one, had once fantasized about reissuing "Casino Royale" on vinyl as a benefit for the Absolute Sound.</p>
        <p>"As soon as this gets around," says Mr. Doris, technical director of the Absolute Sound, "you know what's going to happen to the price of the records."</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson laughs at first, but then he sobers.</p>
        <p>"The vinyl they used in those days is pretty good, so copies, with a little bit of care -- a record-cleaning machine, a properly tracking stylus -- should last. I mean, longer than the average thing.</p>
        <p>"But now," he says, "once they're gone, they're gone."  Richard Panek has written about film and television for Premiere and Mirabella.</p>
