        <p>After 16 days of intense negotiations and an on-and-off government shutdown, Maine legislators adopted a budget today for the 1992 and 1993 fiscal years.</p>
        <p>Gov. John R. McKernan, a Republican who had wrangled with the Democratic-led Legislature over spending, taxes and workers' compensation insurance laws, is expected to sign the two-year $3.2 billion budget, pending final adjustments in a proposal to revise the workers' compensation laws.</p>
        <p>In Maine, where physically hazardous jobs like logging abound and compensation for injuries is relatively generous, the insurance premiums are among the highest in the nation.</p>
        <p>In late afternoon sessions today, the state Senate voted 32 to 1 to pass the new budget; the House of Representatives voted 110 to 24, breaking the budget deadlock that idled more than 10,000 workers since July 1, when the fiscal year began. Trouble in Vacationland</p>
        <p>State workers could be back on the job Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>Despite protests from state workers and Democratic lawmakers, Governor McKernan had ordered many state offices closed and workers laid off, with the exception of emergency services, until a budget was enacted.</p>
        <p>The on-and-off government shutdown has been troublesome for other residents and visitors to the state, long known as a summer playground for the East Coast establishment.</p>
        <p>With the exception of a three-day period last week, when the Governor enacted an emergency budget, state offices and agencies have been closed; state-owned liquor stores have been locked; the state's 47 parks and beaches have had few if any rangers, lifeguards or maintenance workers, and more than 100 highway projects have been abandoned, leaving potholes unfilled and bridges unrepaired. No Lifeguard on Duty</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, a 65-year-old Massachusetts man died after collapsing at Popham Beach State Park, in Phippsburg. The beach manager told local reporters that because of the shutdown no life guards were on duty to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation or radio for help.</p>
        <p>The disruptions came at the peak of Maine's tourist season, which stretches from Memorial Day to Labor Day and brings $1 billion into the state each year. Second only to the forest products industry, the tourism industry is the state's largest employer, with 50,000 workers.</p>
        <p>By the Fourth of July, normally a time of brisk business and celebration for this state, owners of small businesses and bars, like Rachel A. Ladd and her husband, Robert, were beginning to worry.</p>
        <p>"We made it through Sunday, but by Sunday night we didn't even have a bottle of vodka," said Mrs. Ladd at their bar, the Wharf, in Hollowell. She said some disgruntled customers had left the bar but later returned for beers when they found similar situations at other local bars. "I can get plenty of beers, just not liquor," she said.  Less Food; Fewer Baths</p>
        <p>For state workers, the budget impasse was more than just inconvenient.</p>
        <p>"I'm a month late on my mortgage already and I have another payment due today," said Allie Vigue, a 35-year-old mechanic for the state. "I just don't know what to cut next. My food bill has already gone from $100 a month to $40. And we don't even take a bath or shower every day like we did before."</p>
        <p>The major sticking point in budget negotiations was over Maine's $570 million workers' compensation program. Governor McKernan and his Republican allies had insisted on a 35 percent cut in the program, which they said was necessary to offset a $300 million tax increase contained in the budget proposal. Although a reduction is expected in the final agreement, the details were still under consideration tonight.</p>
        <p>The state's Democratic lawmakers have argued that the workers' compensation issue should not be linked to the budget and used to keep state workers off the job.</p>
        <p>Josephine Ledoux, a Kennebunkport resident who drives snow plows and builds guard rails for the Maine Department of Transportation, agreed.</p>
        <p>"I don't think they realize what they are doing to us," said Ms. Ledoux, as she fingered callouses on the inside of her weathered hands. "I live with my grandmother and two teen-age children, and for them I'm it," she said.</p>
        <p>Since Thursday, Ms. Ledoux and about 100 other state workers have protested the shutdown by creating "Union City," an encampment of 43 tents in Capitol Park, a state park across the street from the Maine Statehouse. She and other state workers, most of whom belong to the Massachusetts State Employees Association, have elected a mayor, set up a kitchen and a civic center and published a newspaper. The "residents" stand on the roadside in front of the Statehouse, urging motorists to honk their car horns in solidarity.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 19, 1991, Friday</p>
        <p>An article on Wednesday about the Maine Legislature's approval of a budget for the 1992 and 1993 fiscal years misstated the Senate vote. It was 30 to 1.An entry in the Company Briefs listing of Business Day yesterday referred incorrectly to a proposed special meeting of the shareholders of NCR about its merger with A.T.&amp; T. No date has been set for the meeting, but NCR set Aug. 13 as the record date, meaning that only those who hold NCR shares on that date will be eligible to vote on the merger.</p>
