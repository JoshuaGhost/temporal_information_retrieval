        <p>Thomas F. Upton, age 83, graduated from college last month, realizing his grandest ambition. He forthwith set his next goal: "A Ph.D or 100, whichever comes first."</p>
        <p>Mr. Upton, Fordham University '91, was an Army Colonel, then a businessman. But he never thought conventionally, even as he played conventional roles in a life that originated in Manhattan and found a winding way to his present home in Forest Hills, Queens.</p>
        <p>Despite his lack of a high school education, Mr. Upton learned to go nowhere without a good book and came to believe that "you always remain a 10- or 11-year-old kid."</p>
        <p>But it was only after four score years of life that he learned one of his most important life lessons: that there is more to womanhood than he ever knew.</p>
        <p>"It was a total eye-opener to me," he said of his impulsive decision to take a women's literature course -- a move that would alter his worldview at the ripe age of 83.</p>
        <p>This is a man of surprises. He introduced himself as "Mr. Telephone Booth," and quickly demonstrated why. Mr. Upton purposefully led us to the island on 43d Street that bisects Broadway and Seventh Avenue and pointed to a row of 10 phones. He said he designed them with New York City in mind. First, a sheet of sloping metal makes it impossible to urinate without getting one's shoes wet. Second, "there is no possible way of living in them."</p>
        <p>They are, he assured, as spiffy as when they were installed a quarter century ago. His other booth achievements -- as a designer for a company that sells such to phone companies -- include those ubiquitous phone pedestals, the fitting of phones into subway I-beams and phone carousels for airports.</p>
        <p>Awaiting tripe in a French restaurant, Mr. Upton displayed some photographs. Two were of his daughters -- one a Roman Catholic nun, the other a concert pianist.</p>
        <p>The next showed a woman in a very tailored suit and fishnet veil. This was Anitra Upton, his beloved wife, dead for three years. At the time of this dramatic picture, she was dancing in "Louisiana Purchase" on Broadway.</p>
        <p>The pictures launched Mr. Upton's memory on a slow cruise directly to nowhere in particular. This son of a bookbinder forsook high school, instead attending a business school, where he grimly learned mediocre shorthand. College was his impossible dream. So he went to work as a telegraph operator, then as a stockbroker. On Feb. 14, 1941, he was drafted into the United States Army. He was inducted at (where else?) the now-defunct Camp Upton on Long Island.</p>
        <p>There was fighting in the Pacific, jungle rot and promotions at the pace of a stripe a month. But his clearest vision is of the reunion with his Anitra, who had been dancing with a U.S.O. troupe called the Foxhole Ballet in Italy. Married for almost 15 years, they had been separated for over four.</p>
        <p>The site was a hotel room. "We studied each other so completely in that first instant," he recalled.</p>
        <p>Finally, she spoke. "There's a space between your teeth," she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Upton emerged from war with an obvious need for dental work, the rank of colonel and enough interest in the military to stay in the reserves for nearly two decades. More recently, he served as president of the 24th Infantry Division Association.</p>
        <p>His war stories have a decidedly literary twist. Did you know, for example, that "War and Peace" and "Brothers Karamazov" are superb companions on a 28-day troop ship ride?</p>
        <p>Books, Mr. Upton says, "were my opening into life." But he always assumed that his lack of a high school education precluded college. Then he heard about a Fordham program allowing adults to become degree candidates just by taking a specified number of courses. He graduated cum laude, a B-plus short of magna.</p>
        <p>Honors never mattered. Understanding did. Thomas F. Upton late in life learned to violate the Army man's dictum of never asking questions to which one doesn't know the answers. "The military mind is a calculating mind," he said. "With feminine literature, I was given different coordinates."</p>
        <p>He was particularly touched by a course titled "The Woman in the Text." He read such feminist critics as Luce Irigaray and Elaine C. Showalter and glimpsed startling new vistas. Female sexuality was more elegant than he'd imagined. He longs to read more about it.</p>
        <p>"Here I'd gotten to the 83d year of life, the 59th year of marriage, fatherhood of two daughters and I was constantly amazed at how little I knew about women," he said.</p>
        <p>On June 6, he visited Anitra's grave to honor their wedding anniversary. "I might have made it more wonderful for her," he thought, perhaps with a tear in his lucid blue eyes.</p>
        <p>"I guess we're put on this earth to acquire not knowledge, but wisdom," Mr. Telephone Booth summarized. "That becomes your contribution to the universe."</p>
