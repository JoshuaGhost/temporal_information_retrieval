        <p>Prices of corn and soybean futures rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday amid fears of heat-related crop damage and hopes for increased export sales. Wheat futures also advanced.</p>
        <p>Wheat futures settled 4 1/2 cents to 6 3/4 cents higher in Chicago, with the contract for delivery in September at $2.78 1/2 a bushel; corn was 3 3/4 cents to 8 1/2 cents higher, with September at $2.36 3/4 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3 1/2 cents higher, with September at $1.29 a bushel, and soybeans were 12 1/2 cents to 14 cents higher, with August at $5.35 1/2 a bushel.</p>
        <p>The contracts for July grain and soybean deliveries expired quietly at midday.</p>
        <p>Reports of lighter-than-expected weekend rainfall in the Midwest led to perceptions by traders that corn and soybean conditions were deteriorating.</p>
        <p>In addition, Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan told a United States Feed Grains Council meeting in Massachusetts that corn prices should be higher because of hot, dry conditions in parts of the Midwest. Evidence of Damage</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department provided evidence of crop damage after the close. The agency said in its weekly crop progress report that 58 percent of the United States corn crop was in good to excellent condition as of Sunday, down from 66 percent a week earlier.</p>
        <p>The sharpest change was in Indiana, where the portion of corn rated as good to excellent fell to 24 percent from 43 percent. "We damaged the corn crop last week, and that's in the market," said Katharina Zimmer, grains analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department rated 52 percent of the soybean crop as good to excellent, down from 61 percent a week earlier.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zimmer said yesterday's rally also reflected private forecasts of more hot, dry weather in important Midwestern growing areas.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service issued a forecast after the close of trading that predicted above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall in the Midwest in the first half of next week.</p>
        <p>Oil futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil finished 8 cents to 44 cents lower, with August at $21.72 a barrel; heating oil was 0.07 cent to 0.28 cent lower, with August at 59.16 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.11 cent to 0.40 cent lower, with August at 65.35 cents a gallon, and natural gas was 3.5 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with August at $1.22 for 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
