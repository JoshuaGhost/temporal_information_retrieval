        <p>Everyone remembers the Little League version of a home run. The ball is hit, gets bobbled, juggled and thrown around, and some 12-year old circles the bases, smiles and brags about his error-laden homer.</p>
        <p>Those crazy misplays usually remain on the tiny fields with tiny players, but Pat Kelly hit one last night at Yankee Stadium and it was a pivotal and pitiful play that scored three cheap runs and helped power the Yankees to a 10-2 victory over Seattle.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere was festive at the Stadium as New York won with Mel Hall clubbing a three-run home run, two doubles, a single and driving in four runs; Hensley Meulens belting a pinch-hit two-run home run, and Jeff Johnson pitching a decent seven innings for his third straight victory. Then there was the play when the ball bounced from Mariner to Mariner with no outs being recorded, three Yankees scoring and 25 Yankees smirking.</p>
        <p>"The ball," said Manager Stump Merrill, "needed a handle on it."</p>
        <p>"I just followed one throw to another and went from base to base," said Kelly. "I laughed when I crossed home. Mark that down as a homer."</p>
        <p>Hall had a legitimate homer and might have had five hits if Seattle had not intentionally walked him in the ninth inning. He also made a legitimate plea to be dubbed the starting left fielder. A Blemish for Maas</p>
        <p>"There's no satisfaction in it because no one has come to tell me that I'm the every-day left fielder," said Hall, who leads the team with a .321 average and 53 runs batted in. "No one has told me anything. Left field is still out there."</p>
        <p>Other than Hall's griping, the only blemish for the Yankees came when Kevin Maas lost a possible hit in the fifth after a spectator obstructed Jay Buhner from catching a fly ball in right field. It was costly for Maas, who was 0 for 3 and stretched his hitless streak to 28 times at bats.</p>
        <p>But the comical play that dominated the fourth still had the Yankees howling. They had a 3-2 lead on Hall's homer when Kelly batted with men on second and third. What began as a grounder to pitcher Erik Hanson wound up looking like a Marx Brothers movie when the Mariners finished their routine.</p>
        <p>Maas was caught off third after Kelly's grounder so Hanson threw to Edgar Martinez. That was the first mistake as Hanson should have run at Maas or at least thrown home.</p>
        <p>The second mistake came when Martinez's throw home to Dave Cochrane hit the 6-foot-3-inch Maas in the back and the ball rolled about 20 feet away. "It's the first home run that has ever hit me in the back," deadpanned Maas.</p>
        <p>Cochrane retrieved the loose ball as Alvaro Espinoza tried scoring from second and the catcher's throw to Hanson was the third mistake because it should not have been made. Hanson was not close to the plate and the toss sailed into the Seattle dugout.</p>
        <p>Kelly was on his way to third while the Mariners were imitating Chico, Harpo and Groucho so he was allowed to take an extra base. The rookie trotted home to complete the bizarre play and smiled like a Little Leaguer. "That's a 60-foot inside the parker," he said.</p>
        <p>Almost forgotten was Johnson having his string of 17 1/3 scoreless innings broken when Seattle scored in the second. He allowed 10 hits in seven innings, but received ample support.</p>
        <p>After scoring 23 runs in 11 games, New York exploded for 10 and left Merrill with some questions. Does he really want to send Meulens to Class AAA Columbus? How can Bernie Williams, who had two more hits, not be the every day center fielder? How about Hall in left full time? How long does he keep the slumping Maas in the lineup?</p>
        <p>The questions can wait because Merrill and the Yanks deserved to enjoy the fun. Groucho would have approved. INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>GREG CADARET makes his second start of the season against the Angels Saturday and he may develop into the fifth starter because PASCUAL PEREZ is still feeling stiffness in his right shoulder. The Yanks may be showcasing him because the Mets have expressed interest in Cadaret. . . . ROBERTO KELLY hit off a tee and said his sprained right wrist felt better and may be able to face live pitching by the weekend. . . . JESSE BARFIELD, who had not played in six of the last eight games, started in right field last night and twisted his right ankle. He was replaced by PAT SHERIDAN in the third.</p>
