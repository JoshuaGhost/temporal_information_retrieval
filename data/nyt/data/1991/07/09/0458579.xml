        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has accepted an offer of settlement from a former employee of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Lisa A. Jones, who was convicted of giving false testimony to a grand jury.</p>
        <p>The commission barred Ms. Jones, a member of Drexel's "junk bond" department from 1981 to last year, from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company or municipal securities dealer. She settled the case by consenting to the order, the commission said.</p>
        <p>In March 1989, Ms. Jones was convicted of making false statements to a New York grand jury regarding a stock "parking" scheme between Drexel and Princeton/Newport Partners L.P., a defunct New Jersey brokerage.</p>
        <p>Her conviction, for perjury and obstruction of justice, resulted from testimony she gave to a grand jury in 1988 after she had been granted immunity from prosecution.</p>
        <p>She had been sentenced to 10 months in prison, eight months less than what she received at her original sentencing hearing in 1989. That term was thrown out by a Federal appeals court, which said that the sentence was longer than prescribed by Federal sentencing guidelines.</p>
