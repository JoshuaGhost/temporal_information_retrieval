        <p>Government troops broke the rebel siege of a strategic army camp today, military officials said, completing a 25-day jungle offensive in which hundreds of soldiers and rebels were killed.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after the troops entered the Elephant Pass camp, helicopters landed to evacuate some of the 55 wounded soldiers, the officials said. At least 18 were in serious condition.</p>
        <p>The camp straddles the causeway to the northern Jaffna Peninsula, the stronghold of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are fighting for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka's minority Tamil ethnic group.</p>
        <p>"I am very proud of the achievement," Defense Secretary Cyril Ranatunga said of the offensive. "We were very confident of reaching the camp, but we had to carry out our mission to destroy the rebel bunkers so that there will be no threat to the camp in the future. That is why we took so long."</p>
        <p>The Tamil rebels, entrenched in bunkers, had been besieging the camp, 185 miles northeast of Colombo, since July 10. The Government says 152 soldiers and more than 1,500 rebels have died in the fighting for the camp.</p>
        <p>But a Tamil Tiger spokesman in Paris said on Friday that only 288 rebels died in the fighting. He asserted that "1,600 soldiers were killed or critically wounded." There are no independent estimates of casualties.</p>
