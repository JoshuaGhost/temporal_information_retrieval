        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>If Ira Berkow had any intention to do more than take potshots at Monica Seles ("Return of Seles, and Dog," The Times, July 19), he would have broached the real issue raised by the hubris: How much, if any, accountability do celebrities owe their public? Does Seles really need to give any further explanation as to why she skipped Wimbledon? She has no contract with the public to play for it and certainly no obligation to appease its curiosity as to her whereabouts. J. EDWARD KNIGHTS Newville, Pa.</p>
