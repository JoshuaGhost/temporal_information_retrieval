        <p>ROGER CARAS, the television reporter and author of nearly 60 books on nature and animal life, will become president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals next month. Mr. Caras, 63 years old, who joined ABC News 17 years ago as its wildlife correspondent, is returning to his former career in conservation and animal preservation.</p>
        <p>"The immediate tasks before us," Mr. Caras said by telephone from the society's headquarters in Manhattan, "are absolutely no different than when the society was founded in 1866: alleviating pain, fear and suffering."</p>

        <p>ROGER CARAS, the television reporter and author of nearly 60 books on nature and animal life, will become president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals next month. Mr. Caras, 63 years old, who joined ABC News 17 years ago as its wildlife correspondent, is returning to his former career in conservation and animal preservation.</p>
        <p>"The immediate tasks before us," Mr. Caras said by telephone from the society's headquarters in Manhattan, "are absolutely no different than when the society was founded in 1866: alleviating pain, fear and suffering."</p>
        <p>Mr. Caras said that his work would include setting up a "professional counseling program for people to get sensible, sympathetic advice about their pets."</p>
        <p>He said that two of his goals would be to strengthen the society's policy barring the adoption of any dog or cat until the animal has been spayed or neutered and to push for state legislation to impose the same restrictions on all such pet adoptions.</p>
        <p>The A.S.P.C.A. is one of many humane societies that have similar names but are not formally linked. The group Mr. Caras will head has 400,000 members and offices in Washington and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caras put the country's dog and cat population at 50 million to 55 million.</p>
