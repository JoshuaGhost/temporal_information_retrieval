        <p>Jane Piper, a prominent Philadelphia painter, died on Thursday at her home in the Center City section of the city. She was 74 years old.</p>
        <p>She died of cancer, a friend of the family said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Piper's works were primarily still lifes and are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the National Academy of Design.</p>
        <p>In an article in Art in America magazine, the critic Walter Thompson described her paintings as "a panoply of forms in which the rhythms and interrupting accents have the intricacy of a complex musical score."</p>
        <p>Ms. Piper briefly attended the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts and studied with Arthur B. Carles, a former student of Henri Matisse. At her death, she was still painting.</p>
        <p>Ms. Piper is survived by her husband, E. Digby Baltzell, a professor emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and the man who coined the term WASP; two daughters, Eve Baltzell of Boston and Jan C. Baltzell of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Helen Piper Cresswell and Eleanor Piper De La Cour, both of Bryn Mawr, Pa.</p>
