        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Mr. D'Amato Gets Reckless On Crime" (editorial, July 25), criticizing my amendments to the Senate crime bill, is mistaken. Tough sanctions against those who use guns to commit crimes are not reckless, but essential if we are to stem our nation's burgeoning crime epidemic and restore domestic tranquillity.</p>
        <p>My death penalty amendment would make it a Federal crime to commit murder with a gun that had crossed state lines, permitting capital punishment in such cases. The mandatory minimum sentencing amendment would put behind bars for up to 30 years those who use guns in connection with drug trafficking or crimes of violence.</p>
        <p>Eighty-eight senators voted in support of the mandatory sentencing provision, and 65 senators voted for the death penalty provision. This overwhelming, bipartisan support shows that the proposals are anything but "grandstanding"; rather, they are a serious response by Federal lawmakers to the daily fear of violent crime experienced by Americans in every walk of life.</p>
        <p>You then suggest that "hapless petty thieves normally dealt with in state courts could be subjected to crushing Federal punishments."</p>
        <p>It is clear to crime victims and their families that any thief who totes a gun is neither hapless nor petty.</p>
        <p>Moreover, my amendment would not require Federal prosecution; it would simply permit it.</p>
        <p>Equally specious is the claim that "mandatory minimum sentences flout the carefully crafted sentencing guidelines." In enacting sentencing guidelines, Congress never intended to limit its power to impose mandatory sentences on crimes that cry out for firm punishment.</p>
        <p>Nor would my amendment impose a serious burden on Federal courts and prosecutors. A recent study by the Judicial Impact Office shows that the selective use of the provisions against the most serious offenders, as the Senate intended, would cost about $31 million annually.</p>
        <p>The critical point is that the problem of violent crime has grown so serious that the Federal Government must respond decisively. My amendments do. ALFONSE M. D'AMATO Senator from New York Washington, Aug. 1, 1991</p>
