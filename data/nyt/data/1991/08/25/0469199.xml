        <p>A storm has risen here over comments by the External Affairs Minister, Barbara McDougall, suggesting the day before the Kremlin coup collapsed that Ottawa could work with the new Soviet leadership.</p>
        <p>Her remarks in Ottawa on Tuesday before leaving for an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels appeared to set her apart not only from President Bush and most other Western leaders, but her own Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Mulroney condemned the coup, suspended all Canadian aid and demanded proof from the coup leaders that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and his family were safe.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Mulroney rallied to the defense of his top foreign affairs aide, opposition leaders, political commentators and newspaper editorialists have come down hard on the 57-year-old Minister, a former Toronto financial analyst and business journalist who has been at the External Affairs Department only since April 21.</p>
        <p>Opposition politicians chided her for throwing in the towel while resistance was building to the coup and called for her resignation. "You don't go with a junta like that, that quickly," said Jean Chretien, leader of the Libeal Party. "If she wants to recognize them, she might join them in exile somewhere."</p>
        <p>The Globe and Mail, which usually supports the Progressive Conservative Government, called her timing "awful" and her refusal to pass judgment "astonishing."</p>
        <p>Her comments drew strong fire from Baltic groups. Gabija Petrauskos, vice president of the Lithuanian Canadian Community, said she was "appalled" by Mrs. McDougall's "naivete" and "insensitivity."</p>
        <p>There was consternation as well in the foreign affairs establishment. Alex Morrison, executive director of the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies, one of the leading think tanks, said Mrs. McDougall's remarks resulted "either from a misunderstanding or a mixup between the Prime Minister's office and External Affairs."</p>
        <p>According to a transcipt provided by the External Affairs Department, Mrs. McDougall said on Tuesday at a news conference in Ottawa that the Canadian Government was "not encouraging particularly the resistance in the Soviet Union; it's up to the Soviet people to decide on the success of the coup."</p>
        <p>In response to a question about whether the Government was supporting President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic, she expressed "considerable sympathy" with his position, but added "we are not at this point making any moves towards the individual republics."</p>
        <p>The strict neutrality was in keeping with the long held position of External Affairs that in diplomatic relations central governments are exclusively to be dealt with. 'Our Own Unity Problems'</p>
        <p>"Since we have our own national unity problems, there is an inherent reluctance in Canada to side with nationalies challenging a central government," said Franklyn Griffiths, a professor of political science and East European studies at the University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>Among the grievances of the Soviet coup plotters was the granting of additional authority by Mr. Gorbachev to the constituent republics, such as the Russian federated republic. 'Baptism of Fire'</p>
        <p>Asked to comment on the reaction to Mrs. McDougall's remarks, an External Affairs spokesman in Ottawa, Denys Laliberte, would only refer a reporter to the Prime Minister's defense of her on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney had insisted heatedly that Mrs. McDougall's remarks were not at variance with his policy, although he did concede that uncertainties may have been raised by her "nuance or tone of voice."</p>
        <p>Most analysts agree that although Mrs. McDougall has taken a political hit, she will not be asked to resign. Mr. Morrison of the strategic studies institute said, "You might call this her baptism of fire."</p>
