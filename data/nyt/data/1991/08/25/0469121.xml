        <p>Construction is scheduled to begin this fall on a new opera house for Glyndebourne, on the South Downs in England's county of Sussex, 54 miles from London. The new opera house, due to open in 1994, will seat 1,150 people compared with the present 830. The current auditorium will stay in use for next summer's opera festival, which will start and finish earlier than usual -- early May to late July -- after which it will be taken down. There will be no festival in 1993; the first in the new opera house will take place in the summer of 1994.</p>
        <p>Sir George Christie, chairman of Glyndebourne Productions, said the new, larger auditorium would retain "the intimacy necessary for the repertory that we would continue to aim for." The new building will generate more income from the increased seating, provide improved facilities for the audience and for employees, and help meet "the excessive ticket demand," he said.</p>
        <p>The cost for the work is expected to be about $56 million, of which 75 percent has already been raised.</p>
