        <p>An article on July 14 about problems caused by errors in computer programs reported that in the mid- 1980's, electromagnetic interference from power lines, radio towers and other sources was blamed for software malfunctions in the Army's UH- 60 Blackhawk helicopters. Citing as its source "The Day the Phones Stopped," a book by Leonard Lee, the article said that the interference caused an accident in which 12 crew members were killed and that the same problem was possibly responsible for nearly two dozen other Blackhawk accidents.</p>
        <p>But the article, unlike Mr. Lee's book, did not acknowledge that the Army rejects this explanation for the accidents. In fairness the article should have included a comment from the Army.</p>

        <p>In a letter to The Times on Aug. 6, Secretary of the Army Michael P. W. Stone responded that in the early stages of developing the Blackhawk, defenses against electromagnetic interference were adopted and that the phenomenon has not been responsible for any accidents.</p>
