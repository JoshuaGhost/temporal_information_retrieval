        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Aug. 5 front-page article on Senator Tom Harkin's testing of the waters for a Presidential campaign quotes both sides of the political aisle in measuring him up as a George McGovern with hair and a man with "a Hubert Humphrey-type message that speaks to people's needs." You also note Mr. Harkin's own words in New Hampshire about populism. Probably the last great progressive American populist who thought and spoke like Mr. Harkin was another Iowan, Henry A. Wallace, who served four years as Secretary of Agriculture and two terms as Vice President under Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

        <p>Your Aug. 5 front-page article on Senator Tom Harkin's testing of the waters for a Presidential campaign quotes both sides of the political aisle in measuring him up as a George McGovern with hair and a man with "a Hubert Humphrey-type message that speaks to people's needs."

Wallace, who served four years as Secretary of Agriculture and two terms as Vice President under Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>Memories of Wallace may be dim. But his call for the Age of the Common Man, when others sought the Age of America (only), come back to us 43 years after Wallace founded the Progressive Party of 1948 and was red-baited for his liberal ideas -- which seemed to serve us well during his eight-year Vice Presidency. Now others are calling for another elitist Age of America, even as homeless families suffer in our cities and unemployment benefits run out for possibly hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers.</p>
        <p>If Senator Harkin's populism is based on liberal values, plain and unadulterated, isn't it conceivable that, like Henry Wallace and the Progressive Party, Mr. Harkin will enjoy massive loyal support from blue-collar Democrats and other common people?
