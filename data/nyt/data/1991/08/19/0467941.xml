        <p>The impossible keeps happening in Haiti. The long dictatorship, too entrenched to be ousted, is gone. The people too poor to care about a democracy have created one. And now the President too radical to avoid destructive confrontations has completed six solid months in office.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide once electrified audiences with his blasts at American neocolonialism and angry attacks on the lending policies of the International Monetary Fund. He excoriated military leaders for their complicity with the old regime. And he promised that if he were elected, he would propel a popular tidal wave of revolutionary change.</p>
        <p>But since coming to office in February, President Aristide has modulated his style. He has developed a particularly warm relationship with U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams. His Government has negotiated seriously with the I.M.F. for assistance. He has received crucial support from the armed forces. Most impressive of all, he has proved more willing than most of his predecessors to respect constitutional norms.</p>
        <p>This moderation has provoked predictable grumbling from impatient voices on the left. As predictably, it hasn't dented the distrust of the right. Conservatives are probably correct in assuming that Father Aristide remains faithful to his revolutionary beliefs. For all his moderation, he has already brought substantial change.</p>
        <p>He has started replacing corrupt and authoritarian officials with reformers and democrats, in the armed forces as well as in civilian administration. He has shifted rural police powers from military to civilian hands. And he has begun bringing to justice the thuggish leaders of the Tontons Macoute, the Duvalier family's private army.</p>
        <p>President Aristide has made no visible progress in stimulating Haiti's long-depressed economy. In fact, some of his reforms, like trimming 5,000 unaffordable jobs from the public sector and demanding better treatment for Haitian migrant workers in the Dominican Republic, have increased unemployment, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>But the new President is betting that renewed flows of foreign aid and investment will bring revival over the longer term. That probably explains his willingness to consider policy compromises in exchange for an I.M.F. seal of approval. Realistically, he has no alternative. After years of looting by its elites, Haiti is today too poor to finance its own development.</p>
        <p>Six months into his five-year term, only interim judgments are possible. But President Aristide is clearly off to a smart start.</p>
