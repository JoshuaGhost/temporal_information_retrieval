        <p>After his quick knockout of Brett Lally on Saturday night, Terry Norris, the World Boxing Council super-welterweight champion, said he would like to move up to the middleweight division.</p>
        <p>"If I can, I will fight middleweight," Norris said after gaining the victory at 2:40 of the first round of a scheduled 12-round bout at the Sports Arena. "I won't gain weight, but I will bulk up. If Ray Leonard can do it, I will do it."</p>

        <p>After his quick knockout of Brett Lally on Saturday night, Terry Norris, the World Boxing Council super-welterweight champion, said he would like to move up to the middleweight division.</p>
        <p>"If I can, I will fight middleweight," Norris said after gaining the victory at 2:40 of the first round of a scheduled 12-round bout at the Sports Arena. "I won't gain weight, but I will bulk up. If Ray Leonard can do it, I will do it."</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old Norris, whose record is 29-3-0 with 16 knockouts, is expected to fight Jorge Castro of Argentina in a mandatory title defense in December. Castro is rated as the W.B.C.'s No. 1 contender, but this is not the big fight Norris wants.</p>
        <p>Norris hasn't lost a bout since Julian Jackson, a middleweight, stopped him in two rounds two years ago. After winning the title from Mugabi, Norris has defended it against Rene Jacquot, Sugar Ray Leonard and Donald Curry.</p>
