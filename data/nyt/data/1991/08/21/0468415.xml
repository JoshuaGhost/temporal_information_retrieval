        <p>Birmingham loves BO and the Class AA Barons hope JACKSON returns home to play for them before moving up to the White Sox, the general manager of the Chicago farm club said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Jackson has been pronounced fit to return to baseball and will undergo minor league rehabilitation at a Chicago White Sox farm club to be announced today. White Sox officials declined to comment yesterday on where Jackson will go.</p>
        <p>"I'd love to have him," said JOE SCRIVNER, general manager of the Barons affiliate.</p>
        <p>Jackson, who grew up in Alabama and went to Auburn University, has a house in Birmingham, and Scrivner said there are many other reasons for Jackson to go there. "This is one of the best parks in the country, his doctor is here, his friends and family are here," said Scrivner, whose team plays in a 10,000-seat park.</p>
        <p>Jackson injured his left hip playing for the Los Angeles Raiders last Jan. 13 in a National Football League playoff game. Last March, he was released by the Kansas City Royals, who deemed the injury career-ending. He was then signed by the White Sox.</p>
        <p>Dr. JAMES ANDREWS, Jackson's Birmingham physician, flew to Chicago on Monday for Jackson's monthly checkup, and he and the White Sox medical staff, led by Dr. JAMES BOSCARDIN, agreed Jackson was healthy enough to play. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
