        <p>IVAN F. BOESKY, the Wall Street speculator, has been accused by his estranged wife of defaulting on promissory notes worth more than $2.3 million.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press reported yesterday that SEEMA BOESKY filed a foreclosure action in Hawaii state court on July 19, seeking possession of Mr. Boesky's Yacht Harbor Towers condominium in Honolulu. It asserts that he failed to meet interest payments on two loans: a $2 million note made in April 1987, and a $320,518 note issued in August 1988.</p>
        <p>The loans, with annual interest of 9 percent, were used to finance Mr. Boesky's purchase of the condominium, the suit said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boesky bought the condominium in July 1986 for about $2.9 million, a few months before he agreed to pay $100 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he had illegally traded stocks using inside information. He later served two years of a three-year Federal prison term after pleading guilty to a criminal charge.</p>
