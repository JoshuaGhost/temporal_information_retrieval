        <p>When he tries to explain what is wrong with New York State's social studies curriculum, Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol often uses the example of Christopher Columbus. Teaching that Columbus "discovered" America, he says, ignores the Indians who were already here.</p>
        <p>But the state syllabus has for many years been blending the story of Columbus with Indian history. Textbooks used by the very Scarsdale schools that Mr. Sobol headed before becoming Commissioner in 1988 spend a chapter on Indian civilizations before turning to Columbus, who gets 13 paragraphs.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Sobol's critics, his haste to criticize the syllabus for something it is not doing any more betrays the essentially political nature of the quest to make the curriculum reflect a broader spectrum of cultures. Commissioner as Lightning Rod</p>
        <p>But to Mr. Sobol and his supporters, the Columbus example is nothing more than a handy way to illustrate a complex scholarly issue that he considers pivotal to the future of education and even society itself.</p>
        <p>The sharply divergent views of Mr. Sobol's use of a small anecdote reveal the degree to which Mr. Sobol has become a lightning rod in the fiercely emotional storm raging around multicultural education. In many ways, his conduct has become almost as large a part of the debate as the curriculum's philosophical and educational merits.</p>
        <p>It was largely because of his enthusiasm that the Board of Regents, the policy-making body for the state's public and private schools, voted 12 to 3 on Thursday night to let Mr. Sobol push ahead with a curriculum revision.</p>
        <p>But to Mr. Sobol's critics, his leadership on the issue in the months before the vote betrayed an exaggerated sensitivity to the feelings of black and Hispanic legislators who had questioned the appointment of a superintendent from overwhelmingly white Scarsdale. The result, they say, threatens to be a distortion of history that overstates ethnicity at the expense of a common European-bred heritage and democratic values.</p>
        <p>"He has misrepresented the curriculum as if the argument is whether we should have multiculturalism," said Kenneth Wade, who resigned in March as head of the Education Department's social studies bureau largely out of frustration with Mr. Sobol's handling of this issue. "New York has been a pioneer in multiculturalism. It's been a case of setting up a straw man and knocking him down." 'Really a Great Vision'</p>
        <p>The critics also say that Mr. Sobol has inflamed the ethnic tensions his proposal was aimed at healing. They say he has closed his eyes to remarks hostile to whites and insensitive to Jews that have been made by some advocates of revision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobol's admirers, including Dr. Walter Cooper, a regent from Rochester, say that the tensions surrounding his work reflect ethnic tensions in the larger society, although some seem to acknowledge that greater diplomacy might have been helpful. "I think he has a really great vision of where education should go," said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. "I think sometimes he thinks so much about that vision, he doesn't stop to think about ways to implement it that won't disrupt the entire system."</p>
        <p>The 59-year-old Mr. Sobol is a courtly man of slender build whose speech bears strong traces of Boston, where he grew up. He admitted that "short term, yes," his effort "may seem to have had a polarizing effect." Society at a Crossroads</p>
        <p>"But that underneath tension has been there right along," he said. "And what we're doing is bringing it to light so we can deal with it."</p>
        <p>In an interview in his stately mahogany-paneled Albany office, where the peals of a grandfather clock interrupted sentences that occasionally bordered on the apocalyptic, Mr. Sobol said he had undertaken his mission with a sincere belief that American society was at a crossroads. "I think you can make a very convincing case that the future of this country is being written right now in what happens or what fails to happen to young people in the large cities," he said.</p>
        <p>Without a thorough education for these youngsters, he warned, we will "continue to have an underclass consigned to relatively bleak lives on their own and constituting certainly a drag on, if not a threat to, the well-being of the dominant social order." To educate them well, he said, "you have to know what they think, what they feel, where they're coming from, what they aspire to, what they resent." A Revision 4 Years Ago</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobol, the son of a boxcar loader, conceded that he had managed to be successful without learning much about his father's Polish roots. But he said the world has changed. The diversity of America's population is no longer purely European in origin, and ethnic consciousness has replaced assimilation as the American ethic.</p>
        <p>What has bothered officials within Mr. Sobol's department about his position is that the social studies syllabus was revised four years ago with the aim of studying non-Western and nonwhite cultures. They wonder whether he is basing his misgivings on a curriculum remembered from childhood.</p>
        <p>Women and minority figures are laced throughout, to a fault, critics say. An eighth-grade Scarsdale textbook, adapted to the syllabus, gives six paragraphs to the literary movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, sketching portraits of Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. It gives no more space to Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis.</p>
        <p>In general, said Dr. Edmund W. Gordon, the Yale professor who was the co-chairman of the second of the two committees that reviewed the syllabus, teachers on his panel concluded that the syllabus was not adequately multicultural because it was repeatedly being flouted in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobol bristles at accusations that his motives are political, suggesting that his biggest liability now is the barrage he has taken from conservative critics. "Show me the political mileage I am gaining," he said. Supports a Common Heritage</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, the recommendations he last submitted to the Regents strongly affirm the teaching of a common heritage, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo urged. Mr. Cuomo assailed the second curriculum panel, charging that "the worthy aims of multicultural education are being pushed to such extremes that the casualty is common sense."</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobol said he has not criticized the second panel or the more extreme points voiced because he has preferred to avoid "polarizing rhetoric" in an effort "to enlarge the area of consensus, not only for the sake of this debate but for the sake of this society."</p>
        <p>The debate has been haunted by strong ethnic resentments, some of which were voiced in front of Mr. Sobol. 'Owned the Slave Ships'</p>
        <p>In a November 1989 discussion, a regent, Adelaide L. Sanford, a former Queens principal who is black, told a consultant to the first committee, Dr. Diane Ravitch, who is Jewish, "some of your grandparents owned the slave ships that we came on," according to a tape and transcript of the discussion.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ravitch, now an Assistant United States Secretary of Education, informed Ms. Sanford that her grandparents were poor Jews in Poland who never owned slaves. Ms. Sanford replied she was "speaking ethnically." Ms. Sanford did not return several calls to her home and was said by an acquaintance to be out of the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobol said that in recommending a curriculum overhaul, he had distanced himself from both committees. He ignored the second committee's call that schools prepare students for "promoting economic fairness and social justice" and that the curriculum help lift students' self-esteem.</p>
        <p>"There's enough altruism, enough folly and enough wickedness scattered right throughout the human race to cover us all, and what we need to tell kids is the full truth about history, not to make up things to make them feel good, not to engage in ethnic cheerleading," he said.</p>
