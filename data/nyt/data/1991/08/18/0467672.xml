        <p>THE issue of personal safety in budget-rate motels has been thrust to the forefront. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported on a $10 million settlement made by Motel 6 on a woman who was attacked, robbed and raped in 1988 by two ex-convicts at one of the chain's motels in Fort Worth.</p>
        <p>A week later, the victim, using the pseudonym "Mary," appeared on the Larry King Live show on CNN along with a former Fort Worth police chief and a security consultant from New York.</p>
        <p>Motel 6 declined to talk to The Times about the case, except to say that the safety and security of guests was the essence of the hospitality industry. The chain has the largest share of business in the "budget" category, according to Ida Simmons of D. K. Shifflet, a travel research company in McLean, Va.</p>
        <p>A number of security experts interviewed for this article pointed out that the safety of a motel guest depends not only on the security offered by the individual motel but also on its location: If the motel is in a high-crime area, it will hold the same risks as neighboring businesses and public areas. "A sign is not a guarantee of safety," said Anthony G. Marshall, dean of the School of Hospitality Management of Florida International University.</p>
        <p>In motels, it is impossible to assess the likelihood of crime either by chain name or by price level, according to Charles G. Slepian, a New York lawyer and security consultant who says he has advised every major chain.  Hotels and motels consider their crime statistics proprietary information, he said. "But my gut feeling is that the rate is a lot smaller for the hotel and motel industry overall than for apartment houses, shopping malls, theaters and parking lots," Mr. Slepian said.</p>
        <p>"It may be the safest part of the commercial world because of the landlord's obligation to care for the guest, a duty under law that goes back to the Middle Ages."</p>
        <p>Like others who deal with hoteliers' legal liabilities, Mr. Marshall emphasized that a motel had to exercise "reasonable care" for the safety of its guests. This is based on what the motel has experienced in the past, so that a luxury hotel with a clientele that is likely to carry valuable jewelry might be expected to have room safes. Or a budget motel with a history of burglaries might be expected to have window grilles.</p>
        <p>It was the breach of this responsibility to provide for the guest's safety, of course, that led to the Fort Worth negligence suit after the two ex-convicts, who had been loitering around the motel, barged into the room when the guest opened the door to leave for supper, raped her repeatedly, stole her professional camera equipment and drove off in her auto.  Assessing Risk</p>
        <p>There are questions that prospective guests can ask to help them assess their risk, and there are practical measures to safeguard against attacks in the parking lot and break-ins and thefts in the hallway.</p>
        <p>If a motel is very inexpensive and is in a high-crime area, it is probably wise to pass by; no action by the motel that does not violate basic liberties is likely to be adequate to keep drug dealers from renting rooms, or to prevent criminals from preying on guests in a place where drugs or prostitution are prevalent. And one hotelier said that people loitering in the parking lot should "send up your antenna." Mr. Slepian said, "If there are steel bars and plates of glass between you and the room clerk, it puts you on notice."</p>
        <p>If you do not like what you see, and you have guaranteed your reservation with a credit-card number, call from down the road and cancel it. Even after 6 P.M., some motels will not penalize you.</p>
        <p>Asking a motel on the phone if it has security guards is bootless, the experts agree. If there are guards they're unlikely to be on duty around the clock all week.</p>
        <p>The Fort Worth case raises the question of whether women traveling alone, who are more vulnerable to sex crimes, would be smarter to stay in higher-priced places with enclosed parking areas, avoiding economy lodgings altogether. Because 38 percent of business travelers today are women, this question affects many people on the road.</p>
        <p>Most of the experts responded that higher price was no automatic guarantee. The question of the surroundings was considered a better way to judge.</p>
        <p>Women who travel on business say they prefer a brightly lighted fenced outdoor parking lot to an underground park-it-yourself garage, where you may end up parking a long way from the elevator entrance.</p>
        <p>As for room locale, if it is next to the motel office, it may not be so quiet as elsewhere, but it may enhance your ability to get help if you need it.  Suspiciously Cheap</p>
        <p>A room rate that is too low should be a warning: at the range of $12 to $20, no matter where you are, one hotelier said, the motel is probably not hiring staff of a caliber that will be alert to dangers, to broken locks and doorknobs, to missing bars for sliding doors. The margin has been cut too thin.</p>
        <p>Small rural motels where the proprietors do the cleaning, mow the lawn and run the front office are a different matter, but larger motels under $20 a night may clear a profit in ways that do not augur well for safety: advertising rooms for rent by the hour, for example.</p>
        <p>If the place appears clean, safe and well-lighted, there are other things to check. Rooms that open off a corridor entered with a key give better privacy.</p>
        <p>Many new inside-corridor motels are built with only one entrance -- past the front desk, which also enhances safety.</p>
        <p>Door chains are of use only if they will not rip out under great pressure. Separate deadbolts into the door frame, in addition to doorknob locks, are much better. Mr. Marshall said that 95 percent of all hotels have them now.</p>
        <p>The standard metal key with an engraved room number is a virtual invitation to thieves. If all a motel provides is the doorknob and a key, and there is a break-in, insurers and judges in Florida, Texas and Wisconsin have decided in guests' favor. Ray Ellis, head of risk management for the American Hotel and Motel Association, advised his members that if they provided only a doorknob and a key, and were involved in break-ins, "you settle out of court."</p>
        <p>If the keys have been cross-coded so that the number is not the same as the room number, you are better off.  Doors that open with electronic punch cards are recoded after each occupancy and the previous guest cannot get into your room.</p>
        <p>At Sleep Inns, the budget category in the Choice Hotels chain, you enter both the corridor and your room by inserting your own credit card into an electronic slot. The 10 Sleep Inns are all new and these lock systems cost $500 a room, according to Bob Hazard, chief executive officer of Choice Hotels. He used a customary industry estimate that each $1,000 of expense to build a room results in a $1 increase in the room rate. Others in the hotel business say it has now probably reached $2.</p>
        <p>To go back and redo an older lock system this way would cost $650 a room, Mr. Hazard estimated, which might mean a nightly rate increase of $2 to $ 4: You are not likely to find such gadgets at an old $18 motel.</p>
        <p>Every guest room door should have a peephole; it is a trivial expense.  Whatever the key, it is no help if you open your door to a stranger.</p>
