        <p>Meet Col. Klimenti Amalrik of the K.G.B. He is the central figure in Philip Cornford's CATALYST (Bantam, $19.50), and he is well worth knowing. Today we are a long way from Ian Fleming's Smersh and those Russian spies who were creatures from hell. Klimenti is a well-trained agent and a man of decisive action, to be sure, but he is also a sensitive human being, a feeling father, a man alive to the political currents of his country, a philosopher who has learned to accept stoically the faults of the system.</p>
        <p>"Catalyst" is an ambitious and riveting novel, partly about espionage but mostly about ordinary Russians of the Gorbachev generation. The Australian-born Mr. Cornford, who was a newspaper reporter for 25 years and served as a war correspondent in Afghanistan, has written a book that tries to explain the Russian character as well as the workings of the intelligence services.</p>

        <p>Meet Col. Klimenti Amalrik of the K.G.B. He is the central figure in Philip Cornford's CATALYST (Bantam, $19.50), and he is well worth knowing. Today we are a long way from Ian Fleming's Smersh and those Russian spies who were creatures from hell. Klimenti is a well-trained agent and a man of decisive action, to be sure, but he is also a sensitive human being, a feeling father, a man alive to the political currents of his country, a philosopher who has learned to accept stoically the faults of the system.</p>
        <p>"Catalyst" is an ambitious and riveting novel, partly about espionage but mostly about ordinary Russians of the Gorbachev generation. The Australian-born Mr. Cornford, who was a newspaper reporter for 25 years and served as a war correspondent in Afghanistan, has written a book that tries to explain the Russian character as well as the workings of the intelligence services.</p>
        <p>He shows us Moscow and its inhabitants, the haves and the have-nots, the thriving underworld and its sinister characters. We experience the K.G.B. through the thoughts of Klimenti, discovering the exquisite subtleties to which a high-ranking officer must adjust:</p>
        <p>"Klimenti knew how to fight in the shadows. You stood still, not even a muscle quivering, so still it became a torture -- and you waited, with all the patience of a statue; in the shadows, you had to be inhuman because it was human to move, and movement was the betrayer. The first man to move revealed himself, and then you killed him.</p>
        <p>"That's how you fought in the shadows.</p>
        <p>"They were all waiting, listening to whispers."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cornford has succeeded on all counts, and in the process has put together a story that has many original ideas. A mysterious group that calls itself Vigilantes for Peace starts assassinating leading figures in the Soviet Union and in the United States. The victims are relics of the cold war who oppose disarmament. At first the Soviets think that the C.I.A. is responsible, while the Americans suspect the K.G.B.</p>
        <p>Both countries go on a nuclear alert until it becomes clear that the assassins are bound to an ideology rather than to a nation. A C.I.A. man is detailed to work with Klimenti. At the end Mr. Cornford introduces what at first might appear to be a least likely suspect. Then the reader realizes that everything in the novel has been pointing to this revelation. There may be a few murky spots here and there, as there are in John le Carre's books. But "Catalyst" is by far the best work of its kind to have come this way in a long time.</p>
        <p>More conventional, but nevertheless prime hammock reading, is BAHAMAS BLUE by D. C. Poyer (St. Martin's, $17.95).</p>
        <p>Most of the action takes place in the waters off North Carolina, where a diver is trying to raise a sunken trawler that has cargo a big-time drug dealer desperately wants. The diver, who at one time worked for the drug lord and went to jail for it, is again working for him against his will, and this time he knows his chances of survival are about nil. He and his partner are surrounded by killers, and once they raise the trawler --</p>
        <p>kaput.</p>
        <p>Thus there is plenty of built-in tension, and Mr. Poyer, a competent writer whose previous novels include "Hatteras Blue" and "The Gulf," makes the most of it. He has an accurate ear for dialogue, he fleshes out his characters (especially the drug lord, who is able to rationalize the law of the jungle in a chillingly logical manner), and there is no fat in his prose.</p>
        <p>Dale Brown's SKY MASTERS (Donald I. Fine/Putnam, $21.95) is a Big Book of the kind currently so popular. It was written by someone who knows everything about his subject and nothing about writing. It has maps, an extensive glossary and a list of acknowledgments as long as the fuselage of a B-2 bomber. Of course, it comes with the requisite prologue. Of course, it is full of action. Of course, it revels in the kind of terminology that only a former flier can summon.</p>
        <p>This makes for authenticity, but when page after page is loaded with military argot it is no wonder that the book finds it so hard to get off the ground. "We've tested every possible weapon on a B-2," one character says, "from AGM-130 Striker glide-bombs  [ to ]  Harpoon antiship missiles, sea mines, MK 82 iron bombs, AMRAAM missiles, Sidewinder missiles, the TACIT RAINBOW antiradar cruise missiles, Durandal runway-cratering bombs, AGM-84 SLAM TV-guided missiles. . . ." This kind of prose seems to fill every other page.</p>
        <p>"Sky Masters" is about a confrontation between China and the United States after an overeager Chinese fleet commander lets loose a nuclear bomb in the Pacific. The author's dialogue is as exciting as his descriptions of military hardware. Says a Philippine general: "The bastards attacked, then slinked away like cowardly dogs." Presumably the flying sequences are authentic. Nothing else is.</p>
