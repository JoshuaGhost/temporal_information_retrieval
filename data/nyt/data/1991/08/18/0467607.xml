        <p>THERE is nothing like getting an insect's view of flowers and plants. Although many backyard gardeners may not even think about such a scheme, it is a rewarding exercise outdoors and well within the realm of possibility. How? Very simply with a hand lens, or pocket magnifier as it is sometimes called.</p>
        <p>The lens concentrates the focus on the details of a flower in an amazing way and opens up a new view of the world around us. The lens can be held close to a flower or leaf without picking it, or for a closer look, the flower or leaf can be picked and brought indoors, where it can be handled closely and held to the light. The lens's magnification makes it possible to see the intricate designs of what have heretofore been thought of as rather ordinary plants, flowers and leaves.</p>

        <p>THERE is nothing like getting an insect's view of flowers and plants. Although many backyard gardeners may not even think about such a scheme, it is a rewarding exercise outdoors and well within the realm of possibility. How? Very simply with a hand lens, or pocket magnifier as it is sometimes called.</p>
        <p>The lens concentrates the focus on the details of a flower in an amazing way and opens up a new view of the world around us. The lens can be held close to a flower or leaf without picking it, or for a closer look, the flower or leaf can be picked and brought indoors, where it can be handled closely and held to the light. The lens's magnification makes it possible to see the intricate designs of what have heretofore been thought of as rather ordinary plants, flowers and leaves.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: the use of such a lens even for a day's adventure will open one's eyes and help one to look upon the world of plants differently. Such awareness will at least allow for a brighter appreciation of the beauty of the flora around us. And there will be more to see than just color, which is usually the first feature that helps identify plants.</p>
        <p>The hand lens is an essential tool used by serious botanists who want to get the identification of a plant species right. No true taxonomist would ever want to be in the field without one. Illustrators and painters who draw plants are particularly keen on learning the details of their makeup.</p>
        <p>Although this sort of hand lens is sometimes hard to find, the better ones, that magnify to 10 power at least, are often found in nature centers or stores where cameras and optical equipment are sold. They range in price, but a good 10-power hand lens can be obtained for about $10. Better ones, and cheaper ones with less magnification, are also available. In the field the lens is usually carried on a string or cord hung around the neck.</p>
        <p>This type of lens is essential for anyone who is working with a botanical key to identify a plant. Students particularly need to own such a vital tool. But the average gardener would probably not dissect a plant as carefully as those who are learning to know its special identity.</p>
        <p>How else can someone determine if a plant has minute natural scales on the backs of its leaves (true of many small-leaved rhododendrons) or tiny hairs along the leaf veins? These sorts of detail are best left to the taxonomists.</p>
        <p>This type of plant magnification is especially appealing to children who are eager to have a closer look at how flowers and leaves are put together.</p>
        <p>One of the most fascinating things that a magnifying hand lens can reveal is the route that an insect takes when it pollinates a flower. Route is the right word, too, for the flower's beauty, though pleasing to the gardener's eye, is essentially part of nature's plan for pollination.</p>
        <p>In her delightful book "Botany for All Ages" Jori Hunken offers this clue: "Each flower face is a set of instructions as to how to enter the blossom and procure the promised nectar or pollen. In general, a bright and showy surface or alluring scent catches insects' attention from a distance."</p>
        <p>Then she goes on to describe how flowers are constructed, with guides to the pollinators to entice them into the flower. All of these minute mechanisms are visible with the magnification of the hand lens.</p>
        <p>Yellow, blue and lavender flowers tend to attract bees while flies go for the white flowers. Hummingbirds, it is well known, are attracted to the color red. A butterfly inserts its proboscis deep into each flower for a moment, then it is off just as quickly and beautifully to the next flower.</p>
        <p>If the butterfly's brief visit is followed by an examination of the flowers with a hand lens, the goal of the butterfly's visit will be revealed, and it will be possible to see the route it followed into the flower to sip the nectar.</p>
        <p>Though it has taken eight years, the book "Common-Sense Pest Control" (Taunton Press, Newtown, Conn., $39.95) has arrived. The authors -- William Olkowski, Sheila Daar and Helga Olkowski -- founded the Bio-Integral Resource Center headquartered in Berkeley, Calif., and since 1978 their organization has helped municipal and Federal agencies to get rid of economically damaging pests.</p>
        <p>Always on the sidelines, however, were the pests faced by home gardeners. The researchers found that a modern approach to pest control with environmentally sound methods provides worthy dividends, and they have described it in this excellent reference, worthy of space in any library.
