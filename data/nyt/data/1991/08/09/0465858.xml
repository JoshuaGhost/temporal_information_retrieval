        <p>Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, yesterday signaled a new willingness to provide $1 billion in budget relief for New York City over the next four years if the city can come up with a plan to solve its lingering financial problems.</p>
        <p>"This could help the city stabilize its tax structure, make sure that services continue and that business stays here," Mr. Rohatyn said at a meeting of the corporation in Manhattan at which he sketched out a detailed aid plan.</p>

        <p>Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, yesterday signaled a new willingness to provide $1 billion in budget relief for New York City over the next four years if the city can come up with a plan to solve its lingering financial problems.</p>
        <p>"This could help the city stabilize its tax structure, make sure that services continue and that business stays here," Mr. Rohatyn said at a meeting of the corporation in Manhattan at which he sketched out a detailed aid plan.</p>
        <p>He called for Mayor David N. Dinkins, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, municipal unions and business leaders to agree on a plan to use the $1 billion -- proceeds from a bond refinancing -- to restructure city spending over the next four years, and set a deadline of Dec. 31. Series of Conditions</p>
        <p>Mr. Rohatyn, an investment banker who played a central role in the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, first raised the possibility of a $1 billion budget plan last spring at a time when the city was struggling to close a $3.5 billion gap in its budget.</p>
        <p>He backed off in May, despite intensive pressure from the Mayor, after a bond rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, denounced the idea as form of deficit financing and said that it would lead to a lowering of the city's credit rating.</p>
        <p>But now that the city has successfully balanced its budget, Mr. Rohatyn said he believed the deal could be tailored to meet the objections raised by the rating agency. He laid out a series of terms and conditions for the city in a seven-page memorandum distributed at the board meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rohatyn said that any plan would have to incorporate an agreement on concessions from city union leaders. He said the city should be prepared to promise to avoid any more layoffs and to use attrition to reduce the size of government, if the unions agree to work rule changes. A Specific Request</p>
        <p>For months, union leaders have said they were not willing to make concessions until Mr. Rohatyn promised to use the M.A.C. funds to reduce the need for devastating cuts, while Mr. Rohatyn had said the corporation should be the "caboose" rather than the engine in reaching such an agreement. By putting forward his plan now, Mr. Rohatyn has set that issue aside -- and put pressure on both union leaders and city officials to make a deal.</p>
