        <p>The economy contracted during the second quarter instead of expanding, revised Government figures showed today, suggesting that the recession lasted longer than had previously been thought.</p>
        <p>Total output of goods and services edged down at an annual rate of a tenth of 1 percent, a tiny decline that nevertheless contrasted with the Commerce Department's estimate a month ago that output rose at a pace of four-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June period.</p>
        <p>Most analysts tended to dismiss the fact that gross national product has now shrunk for the latest three quarters and remained confident that the recovery from recession, although almost certainly a desultory recovery, is now under way. President Is Optimistic</p>
        <p>"It doesn't change the outlook very much -- and might even improve it," said Robert H. Chandross, the chief economist for Lloyds Bank North America in New York.</p>
        <p>President Bush, when asked in Kennebunkport, Me., whether today's report meant continued recession, said he did not think so. "I feel all right about things," he said. "There are some statistics up and some down, but basically I think it's doing all right."</p>
        <p>Most reports on economic activity so far this summer have portrayed an economic rebound, and even skeptics regard growth in G.N.P. for the third quarter to be a near certainty. A number of analysts said they did not expect the Federal Reserve to relax monetary policy further in response to today's revisions of the spring-quarter performance.</p>
        <p>Traders in the financial markets, however, grasped at the prospect that signs of economic weakness might yet mean a new cut in interest rates by the Fed, which also trimmed rates earlier this month to give the economy a lift. That hope helped to inspire the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 29.07 points to reach a new high of 3,055.23.  [ Page D8. ]  The G.N.P. report, coupled with a successful auction of new five-year Treasury notes, also helped to push up prices for Treasury securities in the credit market.  [ Page D18. ] Shattering an Illusion</p>
        <p>A minority of private analysts pointed to the latest G.N.P. figures as evidence of lingering weakness that to some implies no significant growth until next year.</p>
        <p>"Today's downward revision of the second-quarter G.N.P. should shatter any remaining illusion of an economic recovery," said Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "This third consecutive quarter of economic contraction removes all doubt about the continuing economic stagnation."</p>
        <p>A prominent reason for caution, some analysts say, is a wavering of confidence among consumers, the source of two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. The ABC News/ Money Magazine Consumer Index was calculated today at minus 38 on a scale ranging from plus 100 to minus 100. The index, based on consumer ratings of the economy, consumers' personal finances and the buying climate, is down one point for the week and within five points of its record low of minus 43, set on Oct. 28.</p>
        <p>Albert Sindlinger, a longtime pollster, said today that consumer incomes had slumped to a 36-year low, in part because of taxes not included in Government inflation statistics. Depleted Inventories</p>
        <p>The main factors dragging the G.N.P. into negative territory were more rapid reductions in business inventories and lower personal spending. Analysts noted, however, that depleted inventories represent a positive factor for gauging future economic activity, since any increase in demand will quickly require stepped-up production.</p>
        <p>"This sets up the possibility of significant economic growth in the second half of the year," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist a Merrill Lynch &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Businesses cut inventories at a $27.7 billion rate in the April-June quarter instead of the $21.2 billion pace initially estimated, a difference of $6.5 billion, the Commerce Department report showed.</p>
        <p>Analysts also tended to playdown the $5.1 billion downward revision in personal spending, which shrank the annual growth rate to 2.8 percent from 3.6 percent. Much of the reduction reflected what were, in effect, accounting changes that shifted car purchases from individuals to businesses.  Daunting Task for Auto Makers</p>
        <p>Even optimists, however, cautioned that the automobile business faced a daunting sales task in coming months, since it has imposed significant price increases that exceed current rebate programs.</p>
        <p>The biggest upward revisions in today's G.N.P. report were a $4.1 billion improvement in foreign trade -- imports were $3.1 billion lower than first estimated and exports $1 billion higher -- and a $3.4 billion rise in the output of producers' durable equipment.</p>
        <p>Over all, analysts said that while they did not consider the half-point revision in G.N.P. to be large, it was somewhat surprising that it was downward and into negative territory. Based on experience, the department said the chances were two out of three that in the future, revisions of second-quarter G.N.P. would not be worse than a four-tenths of 1 percent rate of decline or better than a five-tenths of 1 percent rate of advance.</p>
        <p>The G.N.P. declined at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1991 and 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  Inflation at 3 Percent</p>
        <p>Inflation, as gauged by the fixed-weight G.N.P. price index that assumes the composition of output does not change, ran at 3 percent during the quarter, the same pace as estimated in late July. The nation's savings rate, however, is now seen as remaining at 4.2 percent instead of falling a half point as initially estimated in July's advance report.</p>
        <p>G.N.P. in current dollars rather than 1982 dollars fell to a 4.2 annual percent rate of increase in the second quarter from 4.6 percent in last month's report.</p>
        <p>Today's report also included the Government's first calculation of corporate profits for the spring quarter.</p>
        <p>Profits from current production -- before tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments -- rose $1.7 billion, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to $287.9 billion at an annual rate. This compared with a decline of $2.7 billion, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Increases were posted in manufacturing, trade and the transportation and public utilities group, while profits fell in other nonmanufacturing industries, the department stated.</p>
        <p>Profits before taxes, but without adjustments, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after falling 7.4 percent in the first quarter, and profits after taxes fell 1.6 percent, compared with a 6.3 percent drop during the winter. But current-production cash flow, a measure of a company's ability to finance projects internally, edged up only a tenth of 1 percent after rising 3.5 percent in the first quarter.</p>
