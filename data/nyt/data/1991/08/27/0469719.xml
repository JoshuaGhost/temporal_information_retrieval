        <p>SPURRED by the public's environmental concerns and by consumer demand, the lawn-care industry and researchers are displaying a heightened interest in organic lawn care.</p>
        <p>While maintaining that synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are effective and safe when used correctly, the major manufacturers and purveyors of the synthetics are adding organic lawn compounds to their product lines as well. At the same time, other companies devoted exclusively to organic products are expanding their output. A visit to any well-equipped neighborhood garden center confirms this.</p>
        <p>"We sell both," said Craig Walley, general counsel of the O. M. Scott and Sons Company of Marysville, Ohio, the country's biggest producer of lawn-care products, "but we don't think that from an environmental standpoint there's any significant difference." Further, he said, "we think that it's easier to get a good response from the synthetic fertilizers than from the so-called all-natural fertilizers." That is, he said, the synthetics enable a lawn to "green up" faster. For that reason Scott fortifies some of its organic fertilizers with a synthetic additive.</p>
        <p>The Professional Lawn Care Association of America, which represents the lawn-care industry, favors using synthetic pesticides sparingly, in "spot" treatments of problem areas rather than as a routine, total treatment of the whole lawn. The association says it welcomes alternative approaches, but that the performance of some alternatives has been disappointing.</p>
        <p>One example is milky spore, a bacterium used to combat Japanese beetle grubs that eat the roots of grass. "With the current technology, the progression of the disease is so slow that lawn damage continues for a year or more before control is evident," Thomas J. Delaney, an official of the lawn-care association, said in Congressional testimony last year. But other alternatives are emerging, including nematodes, nearly invisible parasitic worms that kill the grubs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delaney cautions consumers to know what they are getting when they buy what are sold as organic products. "Organic," he said, means that the materials are derived solely from animals or plants.</p>
        <p>The abundance of new products is one fruit of an accelerating and broadening research effort by scientists who specialize in turf grasses. Surprisingly, there are wide gaps in the scientists' knowledge of the ways in which lawn ecosystems work to keep disease and pests in check. Until recently, only a handful of researchers paid much attention to the subject, and they had trouble getting research funds. Now a number of universities are pursuing extensive research, some of it in behalf of the makers of organic lawn products.</p>
        <p>"It was always difficult to get the Federal Government to fund things you couldn't eat or wear," says Dr. Michael G. Villani, a soil insect ecologist at Cornell University's agricultural experiment station at Geneva, N.Y., who specializes in research on lawn insects. Now, he said, concern about the environmental effects of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in lawns and gardens has spurred more interest in alternatives.</p>
        <p>"When I started six years ago," he said, "there were very few people working on alternatives." He said that when he would go to scientific conferences and talk about nematodes as a pest-control agent, "no one had heard of it in turf; they were much more interested in which insecticides were most effective.</p>
        <p>"That's completely turned around now," he said.</p>
