        <p>Bruce Coslet, the Jets' head coach, responded to a report that he may have lied under oath during a hearing for a murder case in California by saying yesterday that he stood by his testimony.</p>
        <p>Mike Blatt, a former interim general manager for the Seattle Seahawks, has been accused of hiring two men to kill a man named Laurence Carnegie. According to prosecutors, Carnegie, who was killed by a crossbow on Feb. 28, 1989, was blamed by Blatt for his failure to get the Seattle general manger's job on a permanent basis.</p>
        <p>The New York Post reported yesterday that Coslet, a friend of Blatt since they were in college together in the 1960's, testified that Blatt never told him before the killing that Tom Flores was getting the job as Seahawks' general manager. The newspaper reported that Euhl Blansett, who is prosecuting the case, said that Coslet gave a contradictory account to investigators in 1989 by saying Blatt told him in a phone call on Feb. 9, 1989, that Flores had the job.</p>
        <p>"Yes, I did testify by phone, under oath," Coslet said in a statement released by the Jets. "I stand by what I said."</p>
        <p>Frank Ramos, the Jets' public-relations director, said that he could not recall when Coslet testified by phone, but said that it was within the last two months. He said he did not know if Coslet would be asked to testify again.</p>
