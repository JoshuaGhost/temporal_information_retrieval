        <p>Regional telephone companies around the country are starting to offer a home version of voice mail, the automated answering system that is the boon, and sometimes the bane, of the modern office.</p>
        <p>The telephone companies are betting that in some areas, many consumers are ready to throw out their answering machines and pay installation charges of as much as $30 and a basic monthly fee of $5 to $10 for the service. The advantages of voice mail over an answering machine include the ability to take messages when the phone is in use, and greater privacy.</p>
        <p>But should voice mail be welcome in your home? Not if an answering machine is adequate for your needs.</p>
        <p>"Voice mail's ability to take messages while you're on the phone may be worth something," said Carl Oppedahl, a New York City patent lawyer and the author of "The Phone Book" (Consumer Reports Books, $15.95). Like Office, Like Home</p>
        <p>"But even if the cost is a few dollars a month," Mr. Oppedahl went on, "it won't take long before it is more expensive than an answering machine."</p>
        <p>Voice mail systems work virtually the same way in a home or an office.  Incoming calls are picked up if a telephone is busy or is not answered. Depending on the options a consumer chooses, messages can be left in up to eight separate "mailboxes," for different members of a family.</p>
        <p>If the dial tone beeps or stutters when a consumer picks up a phone, a message has been recorded. Punching in a code on the phone's keypad plays the message back. By pressing buttons, messages can be fast-forwarded, erased or saved. A typical system will hold up to 30 minutes of messages in each mailbox.</p>
        <p>A major advantage is that voice mail can allow each family member or roommate the privacy of an individual answering system. For a small fee, some telephone companies offer another option that lets a home voice mail user direct the same message to 25 other households with one phone call, if they also have voice mail.</p>
        <p>"Households that have a number of people and those who do work out of their own homes are finding this a very useful tool," said James LaFollette, a marketing director for Pacific Bell, which began offering home voice mail in the San Francisco area in November and in the Los Angeles area in April. About 100,000 of the 4.3 million households in those service areas have subscribed thus far, Mr. LaFollette said.</p>
        <p>The cost varies among regional telephone companies. Pacific Bell, for instance, charges $7 for installation and $4.95 a month for the service and one mailbox; additional mailboxes are $2.50 a month. New Jersey Bell charges a $10 application fee, a $21 connection fee, which it has waived during promotions, and a $5 monthly service charge for one mailbox. Added mailboxes are $2 a month.</p>
        <p>In New York City, New York Telephone charges $6.23 a month for the service and $1.50 more for up to three extra mailboxes. There is a fee of $20 to install the service and adjust the telephone's dial tone so that it stutters when a message comes in. The service is available in parts of most of the five boroughs as well as Long Island and will be available elsewhere soon, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for New York Telephone.</p>
        <p>The customer must have a push-button telephone with star and pound symbols. It is also helpful to have flat-rate service because those with measured service are charged a unit each time a call is forwarded into the system or the users retrieve a call.</p>
        <p>Along with cost, home voice mail has a few other disadvantages when compared with an answering machine. It can't be used to screen calls as an answering machine can, and it does not provide an external signal, like an answering machine's red blinking light, that a message is pending.</p>
        <p>"At the end of the day, I don't know whether I would have the presence of mind to walk into my home, pick up the phone and listen for a stuttering dial tone," said Mr. Oppedahl, the lawyer and writer.</p>
        <p>Some home voice mail users are running into another problem: Understanding how to use the system which, like office voice mail, can be frustrating because some activities, like recording a greeting, may require a series of commands. "We are trying to see what we can do to make the system more understandable to some users," said Karen Johnson, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Bell.</p>
        <p>For consumers who think they can benefit from voice mail, some caution may be advisable over the first few weeks after a system is installed in your area. Soon after Pacific Bell began operating home voice mail in the San Francisco Bay area, its centrally operated system went down several times. However, Mr. LaFollette said Pacific Bell has not had any problems with the system for the past eight months.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, always private telephone answering services as a third option. But these can cost over $30 a month, more than voice mail or answering machines.</p>
