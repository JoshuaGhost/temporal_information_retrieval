        <p>To the Editor: I wish to warn readers of the pitfalls of traveling on domestic airlines within China. My husband and I have been making trips to China since 1979.</p>
        <p>Having found Air China unsatisfactory, we have opted for J.A.L. or United if a trip was to be direct from the United States to China, but within China there is no avoiding Air China itself. Recently many regional airlines have been established, but they are all Air China in disguise.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: I wish to warn readers of the pitfalls of traveling on domestic airlines within China. My husband and I have been making trips to China since 1979.</p>
        <p>Having found Air China unsatisfactory, we have opted for J.A.L. or United if a trip was to be direct from the United States to China, but within China there is no avoiding Air China itself. Recently many regional airlines have been established, but they are all Air China in disguise.</p>
        <p>On a recent trip, we requested from the New York Air China office four tickets between Hangzhou and Beijing. Our travel agent was told only first-class seats were available.</p>
        <p>In Hangzhou we asked our host, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, to reconfirm our flight. Our guide said only economy-class seats were available, and that there would be no refund. This was four days before departure.</p>
        <p>We went away for an overnight trip. When we returned, our guide went back to the airline to retrieve our tickets. This time he said even economy-class seats were no longer available. We purchased four new tickets on a different flight. We brought our first-class ticket back to the United States for refund.</p>
        <p>Air China has taken to insisting that travelers other than groups buy first-class tickets. Actually many Chinese domestic flights don't even have first-class sections. If they do, the first-class seats are given to Government officials or party members. A foreign traveler can be bumped into economy class with no refund or forced to wait two or three days for a different flight. VIRGINIA D. WENG Lyme, N.H. Huan Yao Hou, general manager U.S.A., Air China International, replies: In accordance with usual practice and due to technical reasons, domestic reservations in China must be made by the first carrier, for example, J.A.L. or United Airlines. Otherwise it can be done by his or her sponsor in China. Our New York office is unable to make domestic reservations. China received 270,000 American tourists last year. I am sure most would be satisfied with their trips. Yet I don't exclude the possibility that a few passengers could run into a problem or difficulty.</p>
