        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>From the late 1940's to January, 1957, my husband and I lived at 178 Fifth Avenue, directly across from the Flatiron Building (Streetscapes, July 21). I am confident that it was cleaned at some point during this period. I remember observing the progress of the workers behind clouds of steam, marveling at the contrast between the freshly cleaned areas and the rest of the building, and also noting with pleasure that as the job advanced, our own apartment became significantly brighter. I also recall being horrified that, for whatever reason, the lowest portion of the building was painted, not steam-cleanded.</p>
        <p>The building at 178 Fifth Avenue, built in 1862, is a story in itself. Our studio apartment two flights above street level, probably a converted master bedroom, featured a 13-foot ceiling ornamented with plaster festoons, a huge marble fireplace in working order, 9-foot windows, and an enormous bathtub. Incidentally, the stories about the fierce winds on the corner are true; occasionally, during hurricanes, I saw windows smashed and pedestrians blown to the ground.  MIRIAM HECHT  Manhattan</p>
