        <p>A Loss on a Home Sale</p>
        <p>Question: I own a co-op in Yonkers and want to sell it as soon as possible. But given the poor condition of the real estate market, I realize that I might have to sell at a substantial loss.</p>
        <p>I have been given conflicting information on what the tax implications of such a loss would be. I have been told that any loss would not be deductible, but in a tax guide I have read that I could be allowed to write off a portion of the loss depending on the percentage of rental apartments in the building when it was converted. Is this correct? . . . Jay Rossini, Yonkers</p>
        <p>Answer: No. A spokesman for the New York office of the Internal Revenue Service said that there is no basis for that advice. Section 165(c) of the I.R.S. code says that you cannot deduct the loss on the sale of a personal residence from taxes owed on your income.</p>
        <p>For more information you can refer to I.R.S. publication 523, which deals with the tax implications of the sale of a primary residence.</p>
        <p>A copy of the publication can be ordered by calling the I.R.S. at (800) 829-3676.  Courses for Condo Boards</p>
        <p>Question: Can you suggest short courses or seminars that would be useful for the members of a New York City condominium board? . . . Robyn Wright, Manhattan</p>
        <p>Answer: Yes. The Council of New York Cooperatives and the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives are two nonprofit organizations that serve co-ops and condominiums.</p>
        <p>They hold annual information conferences each fall and offer seminars related to co-op and condominium management throughout the year.</p>
        <p>For more information call the Council of New York Cooperatives at 496-7400, or the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives at (718) 353-5080.</p>
        <p>You might also courses on real estate management offered by the New York University Real Estate Institute or other local colleges. While most are designed for people looking to pursue real estate careers, some courses might fit your needs.</p>
        <p>Next fall N.Y.U. will offer noncredit workshops including seminars on how to choose service and construction contractors and supervisory skills for building and property managers. For more information write the N.Y.U. Real Estate Institute at 11 West 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036 or call 790-1346.  Right to a New Kitchen</p>
        <p>Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment. My kitchen appliances and cabinets are outdated and old-looking. If I agree to a rent increase, would the landlord have to replace the fixtures and renovate my kitchen? . . . Chris Marr, Manhattan</p>
        <p>Answer: No. The New York City Rent Stabilization rules state that your landlord has no obligation to remodel your kitchen cabinets and upgrade your appliances.</p>
        <p>The exception would be if your kitchen appliances, like the stove or refrigerator, were worn to the point of not serving their purpose. Under those circumstances your landlord would be responsible for replacing them.</p>
        <p>Landlords who want to add new services, improvements or equipment must get the tenant's written consent to pay the increase. The owner may charge the tenant a rent increase equal to 1/40th of the cost of the new equipment, including installation costs but not finance charges.</p>
        <p>The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal does not have to issue an order for the owner to start collecting the rent increase for these types of improvements.</p>
