        <p>There is Mozart in the dining room and tea on the porch, served by waiters in black ties. Outside, against the long sweep of emerald lawn, men in Panama hats and women in light dresses recline in canvas chairs, roused every so often by a hoarse but sharp cry of "Well played!"</p>
        <p>It is a dozy summer afternoon at Hurlingham, the 122-year-old sporting club on the banks of the River Thames, and the site of next month's World Croquet Championship, the game's premier international event. Soon, players from Britain, the United States, Japan and five other nations will gather here, crisply outfitted in their game whites, on lawns cropped close as putting greens.  Dominated by Britons</p>
        <p>While the scene will have changed little since the last century, when croquet was devised as a polite summer diversion for proper Victorian ladies and gentlemen, the game at the tournament level bears little resemblance to its more genteel past. These days the playing fields of Hurlingham are no place for the slow or the meek.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, croquet has undergone profound changes, the result of an influx of very young and very aggressive players, many of them teen-agers. They not only dominate the top ranks of the game -- the four finalists at last month's British Open at Hurlingham were all under 22 years old -- but they have reshaped its rhythms.</p>
        <p>Robert Fulford, the 21-year-old British student who is the reigning world champion and British champion, plays with such speed and certainty that he sometimes puts away his opponents in 90 minutes, barely half the time it usually takes to play a match. Other players, like 20-year-old Mark Saurin, the runner-up to Mr. Fulford in last year's world championship, sometimes sprint around the lawn.</p>
        <p>British players have traditionally dominated the ranks of international croquet, reflecting, perhaps, the special place the game has always had in Britain, its mother country. Here is a sport with the same sort of measured pace of lawn bowling or cricket, well-mannered competitions that usually involve a break for lunch and tea.</p>
        <p>"For many years, we associated croquet with country vicars lost in the strawberry patches and 'Alice in Wonderland,' " said Brian Macmillan, who wears the green, silver and yellow striped tie of the British Croquet Association, the game's ruling organization in England. "The dominant image involved older, wealthy people who had big lawns and a lot of time on their hands."</p>
        <p>Now, said Mr. Macmillan, the youngsters are not only playing with more speed and skill and self-absorption, but they are also challenging some of the game's hoary traditions.</p>
        <p>Take dress. During the national championship in July, Chris Haslan, a gangling 17-year-old and one of Britain's top teen-age players, showed up wearing high-top basketball shoes with bright blue and yellow stripes, slouch socks and a T-shirt with a cartoon printed on the front.</p>
        <p>"Not exactly regulation," declared Chris Hudson, an official of the Croquet Association, although he smiled when he said it.</p>
        <p>"With all the young people coming into the game these days, it's a process of education," Mr. Hudson later explained.</p>
        <p>The youth wave has also been jarring for some of the game's veterans, men and women who dominated croquet for years and now find themselves being blown off the lawns by kids. The Croquet Association this year sponsored its first seniors competition, to insure that players 50 years and older would have a chance at winning something. As recently as a decade ago, Mr. Hudson said, most of the top British and international players did not reach their prime until they were nearly 50.</p>
        <p>The popularity of the game has been growing across Britain in recent years, according to the Croquet Association, which now sponsors clinics at schools and outings for companies. It has also begun working with British television networks to begin regular broadcasts of what is called speed croquet, an indoor version of the game that is played on a smaller surface with a 25-minute time limit per turn for each player.  Link to the Computer Age</p>
        <p>It is the tactical challenge that seems to appeal most of all to the young players, many of whom are computer or math whizzes and who sometimes talk about croquet as if it were a kind of video game, except that the combinations and various shots are played out on a 8,820-square foot lawn rather than a video screen.</p>
        <p>Tournament competition differs from the traditional American garden version of the game both in the fact that each player uses two balls and in the layout of the wickets or hoops, which are arranged around a single stake in the center of the lawn.</p>
        <p>In order to navigate as many hoops as possible during a single turn, a player plays off his extra ball and his opponent's balls, earning extra strokes by striking them. At the same time, the player tries to move the balls around the lawn, for strategic advantage on subsequent shots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saurin, who is studying chemistry and management at Sussex University, says he never played croquet until 1985. But on his first few tries, he said, he realized he had a special talent for reading the angles. Two years later he won the British Men's Championship.  No Fame or Fortune</p>
        <p>For all their accomplishments on the lawns, however, neither fame nor fortune accrues to these new young heroes of the game. There is no lucrative professional circuit, and no big money endorsements.</p>
        <p>Beyond the gates of Hurlingham, few people know who these young champions are. In an interview with a London newspaper recently, Mr. Fulford, who is a university math major, recalled watching a television quiz show in a crowded college lounge one afternoon, when the following question was asked, "In which sport is Robert Fulford of Britain world champion?"</p>
        <p>He said it was the first time many of his fellow students even knew he played croquet.</p>
