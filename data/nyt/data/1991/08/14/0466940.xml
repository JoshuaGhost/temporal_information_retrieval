        <p>STAPLES INC., the six-year-old office-supply chain, is growing rapidly. From 34 stores at the end of the 1990 fiscal year, it has 105 now, and intends to have 124 by the end of the 1992 fiscal year, which ends Jan. 31. But analysts say it has the situation well in hand.</p>
        <p>"Staples has the greatest growth potential of any retailer that I follow," said Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. Mr. Vroom predicted the stock, which lost 25 cents yesterday, closing at $19.25 a share in over-the-counter trading, will be selling at $28 to $30 within a year.</p>

        <p>STAPLES INC., the six-year-old office-supply chain, is growing rapidly. From 34 stores at the end of the 1990 fiscal year, it has 105 now, and intends to have 124 by the end of the 1992 fiscal year, which ends Jan. 31. But analysts say it has the situation well in hand.</p>
        <p>"Staples has the greatest growth potential of any retailer that I follow," said Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. Mr. Vroom predicted the stock, which lost 25 cents yesterday, closing at $19.25 a share in over-the-counter trading, will be selling at $28 to $30 within a year.</p>
        <p>The frenetic expansion, especially in California, has had costs, to be sure. The company earned $3.66 million on revenues of $299 million in the 1991 fiscal year, but analysts expect Staples to report a quarterly loss today equal to 6 cents a share. Still, with the new California stores already generating good sales and the company expecting total revenues of $550 million this year, analysts remain bullish.</p>
        <p>"We're expecting an annual earnings growth rate of 40 percent over the next five years," said Margo McGlade, a retail analyst with Paine Webber. "The stock is an excellent long-term investment." The Staples stock split 3 for 2 in July.</p>
        <p>Despite the analysts' praise, seven corporate insiders sold $3.7 million worth of stock in April. Among the sellers were Thomas G. Stemberg, the chairman and chief executive; Henry J. Nasella, the president, and Leo Kahn, chairman of the executive committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasella said that both he and Mr. Stemberg made a practice of divesting 10 percent to 12 percent of their stock options annually and that the 75,000 shares divested by Mr. Kahn were actually sold by one of his trusts, not by Mr. Kahn himself.</p>
        <p>And yesterday, Tiger Management Inc., a New York investment concern and formerly the third-largest shareholder in Staples, announced that it had sold all of its stock -- more than one million shares -- since April 1.</p>
        <p>Tiger refused to comment on the sale, but Mr. Nasella said he received a letter from Stephen F. Mandel Jr., managing director of Tiger, dated July 19 saying that Tiger was selling its stake because the stock had performed so well and Tiger wanted to diversify, although it planned to reinvest in the company in the future. Ms. McGlade said Tiger was simply taking a profit, and the selloff did not change her view of the Staples stock.</p>
        <p>Staples opened its first supermarket for office supplies in the Brighton section of Boston in 1986. Mr. Stemberg and Mr. Kahn, the Staples founders and former rivals in the Boston supermarket business, envisioned a no-frills but well-stocked approach to selling office supplies to the small- and medium-sized businesses that make up more than half of American companies.</p>
        <p>These smaller companies, traditionally shut out from the deep discounts given to large companies, flocked to Staples, where they get discounts of 50 percent and more on more than 5,000 items from pens and paper to fax machines.</p>
        <p>Success brought imitators, and the market quickly got crowded, growing to a $3 billion business in just five years. But analysts still see a strong growth potential for the superstore segment of the $100 billion market for office supplies, furniture and equipment.</p>
        <p>Staples is currently the second-largest such retailer, behind the Office Depot Inc., based in Boca Raton, Fla., with more than $1 billion in revenues. But Mr. Vroom of Alex. Brown said Staples was better positioned than Office Depot for the long term.</p>
        <p>"Staples has put together a much better store format," he said. "In five to seven years, I expect them to be a $2.5 billion to $3 billion company."</p>
        <p>There are rumors in the industry that Office Max, a private company 20 percent owned by the K Mart Corporation, may soon be moving into Boston, the Staples home territory, which could squeeze profits. Mr. Nasella said he was not concerned, adding, "This is a huge business."</p>
        <p>In the year since it entered the Southern California market, Staples has opened 22 stores, 10 of which came in a $17 million acquisition of HQ Office Supplies Warehouse in Los Angeles, and it plans to have 29 by January.</p>
        <p>The company is also expanding its product line. Starting later this month, Staples, which has sold low-priced personal-computer clones for some time, will sell machines from Dell Computers Inc., the mail-order giant based in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>"Our aim is to offer one-stop shopping," Mr. Nasella said. "The PC has become a business commodity, and we need to offer it." He said he had also talked to I.B.M. and Apple among others, and that more PC agreements would be forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Despite its current expansion mode, Mr. Nasella said Staples was not interested in operating in all 50 states. Rather, it wants to saturate its major markets in the Northeast and California, which it can serve from its large distribution centers in Putnam, Conn., and Fontana, Calif.</p>
