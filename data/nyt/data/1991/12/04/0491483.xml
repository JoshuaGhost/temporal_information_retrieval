        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your coverage of the relations of Northwest Airlines with Midway Airlines omits key issues. Midway Airlines ceased operations Nov. 14 (Business Day, Nov. 14) after Northwest terminated acquisition talks. That is how this chapter of the Midway story ended. Here is how it began:</p>
        <p>In late September, top management of Midway came to Northwest (for the third time) and asked for cash. Midway told Northwest it was days or even hours from ceasing operations, turning its employees out on the streets and liquidating. Midway's executives stated the airline was flat broke, and no one -- not any other airlines, not Chicago, not Midway's bankers, no one -- would lift a finger to help. Midway asked Northwest to pump in money to keep Midway flying and to save Midway's operations by considering buying the rest of the bankrupt airline's assets.</p>
        <p>Northwest agreed to help. To keep Midway flying, Northwest put $25 million on the table for Midway's gate leases (the gates were immediately subleased back to Midway). Northwest also agreed to cover large operating losses until the transaction was completed or terminated. We began a thorough review of Midway's operations and began preparations to absorb the Midway system. In that review, we discovered Midway was far sicker financially than anyone had thought, sicker even than Midway had told the Department of Transportation. Midway was beyond saving.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, on Nov. 13 we advised Midway we would not proceed with the acquisition, having decided it would not be responsible to put 45,000 Northwest people and our company at risk for a system we now know could not be saved. Northwest's decision to terminate the transaction was based solely on our analysis of Midway's financial condition. It was not related to our financial negotiations with Minnesota or to any other possible transaction as your Nov. 17 Business Diary suggests.</p>
        <p>Today, Midway's employees are out of work. They would have been out of work five weeks sooner had Northwest not answered Midway's call for help. Is Northwest the villain for having provided Midway employees five more weeks of work and having given Midway executives one last shot at saving their bankrupt airline? We think not.</p>
        <p>Now Northwest is focusing on appropriate use of the Midway Airport gates and urges all airlines to come together to provide Chicago Midway with frequent and regular service. We have offered the gates to other airlines on the same terms at which we bought them and hope all airlines will join us in providing additional service. CHRISTOPHER E. CLOUSER  Senior V.P., Corporate Communications &amp; Advertising Northwest Airlines St. Paul, Nov. 25, 1991</p>
