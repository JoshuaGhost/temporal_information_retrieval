        <p>Japan moved a step today toward sending military forces abroad for the first time since World War II as the lower house of Parliament approved a bill calling for Japanese participation in United Nations peacekeeping forces.</p>
        <p>The measure, backed by Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, still has to be approved by the opposition-controlled upper house of Parliament. At present, it commands a majority of votes there, but the Socialist and Communist Parties have threatened to disrupt the proceedings to prevent its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miyazawa and other leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are pushing the measure as a response to criticism in the United States and elsewhere that it has engaged in "checkbook diplomacy" without sending personnel to troublespots. Reassuring Asian Countries</p>
        <p>The bill was approved by the committee, but a scuffle when the Socialists tried to prevent a vote by blocking the chairman from taking his seat led to widespread criticism in the news media that Mr. Miyazawa's Government was trying to "railroad" the measure through the Parliament.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Prime Minister authorized the measure to be returned to the committee, which then returned it to the floor on Monday.</p>
        <p>Japan has had to reassure China, South Korea and other Asian victims of Japanese aggression in World War II that passage of the bill would not lead to a rearmed Japan.</p>
        <p>Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Japanese believe Japan must do more than contribute money to world peace but that they are uneasy about the idea of Japanese troops going abroad, even if armed only for self-defense and under the command of the United Nations. Cease-Fire Proviso</p>
        <p>The Government has put several safeguards in the bill, such as a proviso that the troops be sent only in situations where a cease-fire is in force. The bill also gives Parliament the right to debate the dispatch of troops, but not to approve their going in advance.</p>
        <p>In the upper house, the Liberal Democratic Party has enlisted the support of the Komeito, or Clean Government Party, which would give the bill the margin of victory for passage. But the Socialists are trying to delay the vote.</p>
