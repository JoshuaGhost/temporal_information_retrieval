        <p>Driven out by political rejection and the plummeting economy, Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to announce his resignation as President of the defunct Soviet Union on Wednesday in a television address to the nation, his office said today.</p>
        <p>Immediately after, the launching codes for the Soviet nuclear arsenal are to be handed over to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, according to the transition plan for shifting Soviet power to the new Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gorbachev prepared to leave the Kremlin, officials of the new commonwealth order met to discuss the horrendous economic problems they share. They also discussed the risks attending the plan of Russia, the dominant republic, to begin shifting Jan. 2 to consumer price rises and other painful free-market necessities.  [ Page 6. ] Fighting in Georgia</p>
        <p>At the same time, civil conflict raged for a third day between the Government and opposition in Georgia, one of the former Soviet republics, not in the commonwealth, whose volatile political vendettas formerly were policed by union troops.</p>
        <p>Tonight, as the red Soviet flag still fluttered brilliantly in the Kremlin floodlights, a retrospective on Mr. Gorbachev's career was shown on state television.</p>
        <p>His successor as the former empire's dominant politician, President Yeltsin, told reporters that in their transition meeting on Monday, Mr. Gorbachev had given him Kremlin archive documents, including some drawn up under Stalin.</p>
        <p>These documents were described in a Tass press agency report as "casting light upon crimes against people of the Soviet Union and other countries." No other details were offered.  11th Hour Warnings</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev was still warning in eleventh hour news interviews against "huge perils" he sees along the commonwealth path being taken by 11 former Soviet republics newly dedicated to independence within a loose association.</p>
        <p>But the Soviet leader appeared ready to accept his fate, which will include as retirement benefits his 48,000-ruble annual salary. This is luxury remuneration under old Communist standards but, under the degraded economy of Mr. Gorbachev's reform years, it translates to less than $10 a week in the hard-currency world market to which the new commonwealth aspires.</p>
        <p>The 60-year-old Soviet leader, whose reforms made possible the freely shifting politics to which he must now succumb, will also receive a Moscow apartment, a dacha retreat, two cars and 20 bodyguards. His pension, worked out by Mr. Yeltsin and other onetime rivals within the party who now are the leaders of the commonwealth, includes free care at the elite hospital system left as one of the legacies of the Communist hierarchy that Mr. Gorbachev once dominated.</p>
        <p>The benefits, however, amount to so much hemlock to Mr. Gorbachev. The occasion is a bitter defeat as he retains worldwide respect for his daring nuclear disarmament initiatives even as he is shunned at home by the remnant republics of the union he fought to maintain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev personally thanked and shook the hands of his Kremlin staff today in cleaning up his affairs. "I wish you all great happiness and success," he told them.</p>
        <p>After six years and nine months in office, Mr. Gorbachev seemed reflective in one newspaper interview about some of the critical might-have-beens of his tumultuous, liberating, crisis-bedeviled tenure.</p>
        <p>"I expected a blow from the party's conservative circles and, therefore, I kept them close," he said in explaining why the conspirators who seized him last August in the hard-line coup that failed included his closest military and cabinet advisers. "Work among them was also under way," he told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. "This is the reason why I did not quit the post of the party general secretary, whose tight grip I always felt."  Dismisses Coup Speculation</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev dismissed the likelihood of another military coup attempt.</p>
        <p>"The people will not accept it and the army will not move to stage it," he told the newspaper. "The sole danger emanates from the street, if disaffected people will take to the street and political prostitues and profiteers will prod them to action."</p>
        <p>On the eve of his resignation, which Mr. Gorbachev termed "unavoidable"in one of his interviews, financial ministers tabulating the Soviet Union's debt announced that it would grow another five billion rubles this month and top the trillion-ruble mark for the year. The republics in the new commonwealth must still decide how to apportion this debt, which they have agreed in principle to honor.</p>
        <p>A thicket of economic problems awaits the new commonwealth. Russia, the richest and largest republic, already is exercising the upper hand in seeking to set the currency and other free-market policies that the weaker, poorer republics, such as the central Asian nations, will find hard to resist.</p>
        <p>A final session of the Soviet Parliament was attempted but had to be adjourned overnight after deputies could not bring themselves to vote immediately on a resolution stating that the "the U.S.S.R. as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality has ceased to exist."</p>
        <p>"This is treason and betrayal," complained a deputy, Vavil Nosov.</p>
        <p>The commonwealth went forward nevertheless, with republic prime ministers meeting here to prepare for a meeting of their presidents on Dec. 30 in Minsk, Byelorussia, the commonwealth headquarters.</p>
        <p>That session will take up major differences that remain on creating a common military defense command and on controlling the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons. Kazakhstan, one of four republics with strategic missiles on its soil, is balking at a Russian proposal that all strategic missiles be moved to Russia. It has agreed in the meanwhile that President Yeltsin should be the individual controlling the nuclear button but with the assent of all four republics needed for a decision to launch.</p>
        <p>The new politics and jealousies of the commonwealth are already becoming clear. President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine complained that the West, in paying special attention to Russia, was slighting the other independent and equal states that had arisen with the fall of the union.  Death Toll Climbs</p>
        <p>In Georgia, the civil conflict continued to take lives and rip up the government center in the heart of Tbilisi as President Zviad Gamsakhurdia's defenders engaged in artillery, machine gun and rifle battles with rebel national guard units.</p>
        <p>The death toll estimates varied from 30 to 80. The rebels, led by former Prime Minister Tengis Sigua and a national guard officer, Tengis Khitovani, claimed they were blocking the advance of reinforcements and would maintain the attack until the resignation of Mr. Gamsakhurdia.</p>
        <p>Opposition critics complain that by introducing press censorship and other restrictions, Mr. Gamsakhurdia has been building an autocracy. But the Georgian President, whose popularity with the masses was established in a landslide election victory last spring, says his critics are merely coup plotters and opportunists.</p>
        <p>President Yeltsin said that he had rejected President Gamsakhurdia's plea for a meeting because the Georgian leader had committed human rights violations in using military force against the Ossetian minority in their nationalism drive.</p>
        <p>Commonwealth members, Mr. Yeltsin said, wanted to create "volunteer inter-republic security forces" in order to avoid appealing to the United Nations to handle such troubles.</p>
