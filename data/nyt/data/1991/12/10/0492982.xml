        <p>Calling 1991 a "disappointment" and an "aberration," John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, argued the company's case before Wall Street analysts yesterday at an unusual briefing in which the company's top five executives detailed plans for decentralizing the world's largest computer maker.</p>

        <p>Calling 1991 a "disappointment" and an "aberration," John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, argued the company's case before Wall Street analysts yesterday at an unusual briefing in which the company's top five executives detailed plans for decentralizing the world's largest computer maker.</p>
        <p>But in Wall Street's eyes, yesterday's presentation fell short.</p>
        <p>After hearing the company's cautious 1992 earnings forecast, skeptical Wall Street investors hammered I.B.M.'s stock, sending it down $3.875 to a nine-year low of $85.125 yesterday in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>"After the presentation, a lot of analysts returned to their offices and began cutting their earnings estimates," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. He said many analysts decided that their projections were too high after the International Business Machines Corporation said its revenues were expected to grow at a single-digit rate next year. Disappointed Analysts</p>
        <p>Other analysts said they had a negative view of I.B.M. because they still did not see the company making fundamental changes to control costs, despite its plans for decentralizing its operations and cutting its payroll by 20,000 next year. As such, a number of portfolio managers decided to sell the stock because any significant earnings growth seemed to await improvements in the economy.</p>
        <p>"The key for me is the overwhelming view that I.B.M. is trying to grow its way out of its problems, and really nothing's changed," said Stephen K. Smith, an analyst at Paine Webber. "That's not what people want to hear. I.B.M. still continues to see the mainframe through rose-colored glasses."</p>
        <p>The briefing followed the company's recent disclosure that it would break itself up into a federation of competing businesses. Yesterday, Mr. Akers reiterated that the company was considering a variety of options, including eventually selling portions or perhaps all or several of its businesses, seeking new investments and joint ventures and taking its top executives out of the day-to-day operations of its newly independent companies.</p>
        <p>When I.B.M. disclosed two weeks ago that it planned to cut its work force by at least another 20,000 employees next year through a program of incentives and early retirements , it said it was setting aside $3 billion to cover the costs of the changes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Akers said yesterday that the plan for radically changing I.B.M.'s structure and freeing its individual businesses to act with more autonomy, detailed last week, would re-energize the Armonk, N.Y., company.</p>
        <p>"We are about to close the books on the most difficult year in the history of the information-technology industry," Mr. Akers said. "We're embarking on a very different I.B.M. than you and I have known all of our professional lives."</p>
        <p>Saying that I.B.M. planned to increase its return on equity, which is now about 14 percent, to 18 percent over the next three years, I.B.M.'s chairman challenged the company's Japanese competitors. He argued that they would soon find I.B.M. was a tough competitor in many equipment and component markets.</p>
        <p>"The strategy of the Japanese has been to attack the suppliers of their competition," said James Magid, a financial analyst at Needham &amp; Company. "I.B.M. recognizes that system is open at every level and that they have to be a major participant at all levels of the business."</p>
        <p>Despite the bearish Wall Street analysts, some appeared favorably impressed by Mr. Akers's aggressive performance.</p>
        <p>A number said that they saw meaningful long-term changes at the company and gave Mr. Akers credit for making hard decisions and implementing the corporate restructuring.</p>
        <p>"It was a good meeting," said Jay P. Stevens, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "This is the first time we've ever seen the C.F.O. stand up there and present real business models."</p>
        <p>Frank Metz, the company's chief financial officer, said that I.B.M. expected the computer industry's revenues to grow 7 percent to 10 percent next year and that he believed I.B.M. would increase its revenues by 7 percent to 8 percent. He said, however, he had based the company's business model for next year on a growth rate of 6 percent. Roster of Executives</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in rapid-fire order, analysts heard from Mr. Akers; C. Michael Armstrong, senior vice president in charge of world trade; Terry R. Lautenbach, who is responsible for the company's American business; Jack D. Kuehler, the company's president, who is in charge of I.B.M.'s personal systems and technology businesses, and Mr. Metz. They all outlined the problems the company faced and its new plan to gain ground in an increasingly competitive computer industry.</p>
        <p>Then the company's top officers spent an hour answering questions from analysts, trying to show that I.B.M.'s management was grappling effectively with the striking changes that have forced it to rethink its fundamental approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Akers said that if earnings growth did not return by the middle of next year, the company would take a hard look at a new round of cost-cutting.</p>
