        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Scientists Suggest Dumping Sludge on Vast, Barren Deep Sea Floor" (front page, Dec. 2):</p>
        <p>Sewage sludge is the semi-solid residue of waste-water treatment (sewage) plants. The vast bulk of the material is organic and biodegradable, not at all like atomic wastes. Being biodegradable, it can be rendered benign by simple composting. All it takes is a series of troughs to contain the sludge, which is agitated, aerated and turned by what amounts to an automated roto-tiller.</p>
        <p>Because any biodegradable material is compostable, the appropriate balances can be achieved by such additives as sawdust, paper, leaves, yard waste and household garbage. In short, sewage sludge can be reduced to a benign soil additive without indulging in some vast scheme, at horrendous cost, to lose the stuff on the ocean floor.</p>
        <p>Composting organic wastes is not a cure-all. Certain heavy metals and some chemical components of the waste stream will not compost. Their inclusion in sludge, however, does not render the process unacceptable. Compost that contains inordinately high levels of these materials is usable to cover landfills, for landscaping applications and related uses. If waste-water treatment plants are upgraded, even these substances can be reduced to acceptable levels.</p>
        <p>The idea of carting sludge far out at sea in sealed containers and then dumping it in the ocean depths is inefficient, unacceptably costly -- and unnecessary. It is truly equivalent to throwing out the baby with the bath water. CHARLES J. LINCOLN West Hartford, Conn., Dec. 9, 1991</p>
