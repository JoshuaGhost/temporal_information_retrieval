        <p>Women's fear of breast cancer is grounded in reality: One of every nine American women will be found to have the disease. So it's sad and even infuriating that one very promising drug treatment can't be tested in this country.</p>
        <p>The drug is RU-486, which might well be effective against breast cancer. But RU-486, used in conjunction with prostaglandin, is a safe and effective abortion agent. And Roussel-Uclaf, the French company that developed RU-486, won't even test it in this country because it fears that American anti-abortion activists will stop buying its other pharmaceuticals. The company has even turned down requests for cooperation on breast cancer studies from two American cancer centers.</p>
        <p>Instead, Roussel-Uclaf has timidly arranged for large-scale testing in Canada, where the company thinks it is far less likely to face boos and boycotts. Canadian women, then, may well have a useful new therapy for breast cancer within a few years. U.S. drug regulation being very strict, U.S. women will not.</p>
        <p>There may be a way, though, for American women to override Roussel-Uclaf's pusillanimity -- and that's by outshouting the "lonely hecklers . . . who should be ignored," in the words of Mayor David Dinkins of New York, who joined 29 other big-city mayors in asking that RU-486 be brought here. Let them take a leaf from the book of those who raise their voices on behalf of people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>There are intelligent ways to protest the Food and Drug Administration's "import alert," which was meant to apply only to small personal quantities of the drug but frightened Roussel-Uclaf out of supplying the material for big studies. There are intelligent ways to protest to Congress about the control imposed by a noisy minority over the lives of millions of women.</p>
