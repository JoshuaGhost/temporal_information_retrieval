        <p>A representative of the Chamber of Commerce has said that the family leave bill passed by the House of Representatives, which guarantees unpaid leave up to 90 days for family emergencies, "actually could hurt those it is designed to help by forcing additional costs onto employers and eliminating jobs" (news article, Nov. 14). We must take issue with his comment. Leaves to deal with family needs don't increase costs. They limit employee costs by reducing turnover, absenteeism and lateness.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A representative of the Chamber of Commerce has said that the family leave bill passed by the House of Representatives, which guarantees unpaid leave up to 90 days for family emergencies, "actually could hurt those it is designed to help by forcing additional costs onto employers and eliminating jobs" (news article, Nov. 14). We must take issue with his comment. Leaves to deal with family needs don't increase costs. They limit employee costs by reducing turnover, absenteeism and lateness.</p>
        <p>An executive at Corning Inc. recently told the Families &amp; Work Institute that the glass company's family-oriented employment policies have resulted in a 50 percent cut in turnover and positive financial performance. Scores of other companies have reported similar results.</p>
        <p>As a society, we rail against the educational failures and drug abuse of this country's children, yet we do little to encourage more parental involvement. Providing adequate family leave with job protection at times of birth, adoption or serious illness of a child is a critical first step.</p>
        <p>The United States is the only major industrialized nation without job-protected maternity leave. It's time for President Bush to sign this bill and then move on to take other actions to help children and the elderly in this society.
