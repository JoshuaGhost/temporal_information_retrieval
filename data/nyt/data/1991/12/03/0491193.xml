        <p>On the heels of Ukraine's landslide vote for independence, President Bush ordered Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today to visit Kiev this month to discuss American concerns about the control of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory.</p>
        <p>The announcement came as the White House officially welcomed the Sunday vote as "a striking testimony to the will for liberty" and indicated again that it would grant full diplomatic recognition to the new nation in due course.</p>
        <p>The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that Mr. Bush had discussed Mr. Baker's visit, which will include a stop in Moscow, with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and that the Presidents agreed on the need for a practical approach to Ukraine's action, which Mr. Gorbachev has opposed. Whittling Gorbachev's Power</p>
        <p>But today's White House actions seemed only to underscore Mr. Gorbachev's diminishing importance in an American policy on the Soviet Union, which has shifted in recent weeks away from the Kremlin and toward the fractious republics. The decision to send Mr. Baker to Kiev to talk about nuclear weapons undercuts Mr. Gorbachev's role as the primary Soviet leader responsible for arms issues, one of the few clear responsibilities he has maintained since the failed coup in August.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker will be preceded to Kiev by an Assistant Secretary of State, Thomas M. T. Niles, who will travel there for meetings this week. Both envoys will discuss the nuclear issue, Ukraine's obligation to honor international treaties signed by Moscow, and its role in salvaging the crumbling Soviet economy, the White House said in a prepared statement.</p>
        <p>Of the three, the question of who will control nuclear weapons is by far the most urgent. It has driven an effective reversal of American policy since the summer, when President Bush urged Ukrainians, in a major speech in Kiev on Aug. 1, to retain their political and military ties to the old Soviet center. Road to Nuclear-Free Ukraine</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Baker would discuss with Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader, "how we might help in terms of eliminating nuclear weapons" on Ukrainian soil.</p>
        <p>Ukraine's leaders have pledged to create a nuclear-free state. But they simultaneously laid claim this summer to the estimated 176 ballistic missiles and 1,000 or so Soviet nuclear warheads still on their soil, arguing that their control cannot be left solely to a Moscow Government that they despise and mistrust.</p>
        <p>When Ukraine said this summer that it planned to create its own 450,000-man military, supplanting the Soviet Army controlled by Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic confronted President Kravchuk, demanding that all nuclear weapons be returned to Russian soil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk refused, and the two nations later signed a temporary military and economic agreement that put off the question of nuclear control.</p>
        <p>In Kiev today, Mr. Kravchuk said he hoped to create a collective military command of nuclear weapons with Russia, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan, the other three former Soviet republics with nuclear forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater said today that Mr. Baker and Mr. Niles would raise with Ukrainian leaders their obligation to adhere to arms-control accords and their need to control the spread of "dangerous military-related technology" to developing nations.</p>
        <p>An Administration Soviet expert characterized Ukraine today as sharing Washington's desire to control nuclear arms, adding: "I think all the parties -- Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Kravchuk, the allies -- are agreed that we have to work this one out." Cashing in Chips</p>
        <p>Some outside analysts have speculated that Kiev wants to use nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in negotiating the terms of its relations with Moscow and the West.</p>
        <p>With Ukrainian sovereignty a foregone conclusion, "we're trying to be both constructive and practical," said an Administration Soviet expert, "constructive in that we don't want to accelerate the decentralization process, and practical in that we have to keep talking to the republics on these issues."</p>
        <p>While questions of economic integration and treaty obligations are important indicators of future American relations with the republics, "the nuclear issue, for Ukraine, is obviously of critical importance."</p>
        <p>The United States is also concerned about the security of Soviet nuclear reactors, which contain nuclear materials that could be stolen or sold to terrorists or developing nations, and also pose potential environmental threats. Recognition Not Immediate</p>
        <p>The 1985 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, which many analysts say played a role in the chain of events that led to the Soviet breakup, occurred in Ukraine, not far from Kiev, the capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker will discuss that and other Ukrainian matters with the governments of Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev during a stop in Moscow. Mr.  Niles will go immediately to Kiev for talks with Mr. Kravchuk about future relations with Washington..</p>
        <p>The United States is unlikely to recognize Ukrainian sovereignty until after Mr. Baker's trip, Mr. Fitzwater said, but he left little doubt that full recognition will eventually take place.</p>
        <p>"The United States welcomes this expression of democracy which is a tribute to the spirit of the Ukrainian people," Mr. Fitzwater said in a prepared statement. "Ukraine's aspiration to join the Euroatlantic community is striking testimony to the will for liberty in a nation which has persisted and survived despite the terrible calamities of the 20th century."</p>
        <p>In a single phrase in his four-page statement, Mr. Fitzwater said that the White House remains committed to dealing with Mr. Gorbachev, on unspecified matters. They include the Soviet military, the disposition of the Soviet foreign debt and Mr. Gorbachev's dimming hopes that the remaining 12 republics will join in a single economic union. Another Policy Shift</p>
        <p>But by sending Mr. Baker to talk directly to Mr. Kravchuk about nuclear weapons, the White House has moved from the Kremlin to the republics another critical item on the foreign-policy agenda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater acknowledged that the United States has no choice now but to adapt its own policies to the rising independence movement in the Soviet republics, a movement Mr. Bush personally sought to dampen in his much-noted speech on Aug. 1, less than three weeks before the coup that speeded the disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>"One cannot deny the changes that have already taken place and the process of transformation that's under way," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater said that President Bush discussed American policy toward Ukraine in telephone calls on Saturday with Mr. Gorbachev and Canada's prime minister, Brian Mulroney.  "All three leaders view this matter much as the United States does, which is to say they want to provide constructive and realistic approaches to the changes going on there," he said.</p>
        <p>Soviet news services reported that Mr. Gorbachev told Mr. Bush that while Ukrainian independence may be unavoidable, Kiev's refusal to join an alliance of the former Soviet states would be a "catastrophe."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater and other officials today stressed the United States' interest in promoting friendly relations between the Ukrainian leadership and Mr. Yeltsin's Russian government, which are divided by nationalistic impulses, but still lashed together by economic and military ties.</p>
        <p>Beyond their disputes over military matters, Russia and Ukraine have argued lately over their shared borders and over Ukraine's determination to create a separate monetary system.</p>
        <p>The ability of Russia and Ukraine to work together in openness and mutual respect "will be a test of whether they are capable of making the transition to democratic societies which respect the rights of individuals," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We hope and believe that the leaders in Moscow and Kiev will establish such a relationship."</p>
