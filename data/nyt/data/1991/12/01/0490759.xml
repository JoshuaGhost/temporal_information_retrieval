        <p>I am baffled by Henig's premise that the family is so revered in our society. In my experience, women (and men) who spend time rearing children at the expense of their careers often are not admired, and are certainly not rewarded or respected in the business world. Those who are universally admired, rewarded and respected are the superwomen who manage to pursue their careers and raise a family at the same time -- the women who "have it all." LEORA D.
