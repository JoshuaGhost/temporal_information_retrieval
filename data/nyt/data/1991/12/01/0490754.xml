        <p>I was interrupted seven times by my 4-year-old and 2-year-old as I was reading Robin Marantz Henig's Hers column "Family Isn't Everything" (Nov. 3). Sometimes I'm smart and take the Magazine or Book Review into the bathtub with me, along with a cup of coffee. Henig's honest portrayal of family life was therapy for me. I was beginning to think I was selfish and lacked maternal instinct.  My family-centered friends don't admit they have such feelings, and my three friends who are trying everything that modern medicine has available in an effort to conceive would consider me an ingrate. Yes, I love my children and wouldn't be without them. But I can't help fantasizing about what my life would be like if I had chosen to take another direction. LESLIE ZUCKER</p>
