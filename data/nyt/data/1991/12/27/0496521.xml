        <p>It is perhaps too early to push a panic button or activate a siren, but the Devils' record in the Patrick Division has reached alarming proportions.</p>
        <p>A marvelous opportunity to improve their division mark tonight went up in smoke for the Devils in their game against the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum.</p>
        <p>The Devils had two-goal leads four times against the Islanders, but they allowed two short-handed goals and finally an even-strength goal with 0.5 seconds left in regulation time and settled for a 5-5 deadlock.</p>
        <p>Tonight's tie was the 16th Patrick Division game for the Devils and their record in the division is 4-8-4. What is more disheartening is that in the 10 division games outside New Jersey, the Devils have one victory, a 4-2 decision Oct. 24 in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>"I'm really concerned," Devils Coach Tom McVie said about his team's record in the Patrick Division. "We're not going to get it done with this kind of record in the division."</p>
        <p>Jeff Norton and Robert DiMaio scored the short-handed goals, and Derek King got the tying goal for the Islanders with half a second left in the third period. Benoit Hogue and Rich Pilon had the other goals for the Islanders (11-17-6).</p>
        <p>Dave Barr had his first and second goals of the season for the Devils (16-13-6), who also had goals from Laurie Boschman, Peter Stastny and Claude Lemieux on a night that only the New Jersey penalty killers had something to be proud of.</p>
        <p>That group, which entered the game ranked first in the league, looked every bit as worthy of their ranking in killing a two-man advantage for the Islanders that lasted 37 seconds early in the game.</p>
        <p>With help from Chris Terreri's remarkable saves, the Devils killed three penalties in the first period before they opened the scoring on Barr's first goal of the season.</p>
        <p>Barr's first goal, a deflection of Aleksei Kasatonov's shot from high in the slot, came with 2 minutes 34 seconds left before the first intermission in a 3-on-1 break for the Devils.</p>
        <p>Barr gave the Devils a two-goal cushion with a wrist shot from between the hash marks of the two circles after a pass by Patrik Sudnstrom, 3:36 into the second period.</p>
        <p>Norton narrowed the gap for the Islanders with his first goal of the season, 13:50 into the second period, during a power play for the Devils.</p>
        <p>Stephane Richer, who was playing the left point on a two-man advantage for the Devils, missed the puck at the Islanders' blue line as one of the Islanders' penalties was expiring.</p>
        <p>Norton picked up the puck behind Richer in the neutral zone after he stepped onto the ice from the penalty box and beat Terreri.</p>
        <p>Boschman's fifth goal of the season -- but first since Oct. 26 -- gave the Devils a 3-1 lead four minutes later, but Hogue's 15th with 28 seconds left in the period closed the gap again for the Islanders.</p>
        <p>A spectacular save by Terreri on Uwe Krup, before the third period was a minute old, kept the Islanders from tying the score and immediately brought a goal at the other end.</p>
        <p>Stastny got the quick goal, 66 seconds into the third, for a 4-2 lead, but the Islanders again came within one on Pilon's goal 11:32 into the period.</p>
        <p>Lemieux extended the Devils' lead to two goals 24 seconds later before DiMaio's short-handed goal, with 3:25 left, set up King's tying goal on the last tick of the clock in regulation.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to make sure I fired it high," King said about his tying goal against Terreri, "because I know he likes to drop."</p>
        <p>Terreri said he didn't want to take any risks with the clock running out.</p>
        <p>"I knew there was only a couple of seconds left, and I didn't want to go charging out at King," Terreri said. "It was a great shot, it just got underneath the crossbar."  HOCKEY</p>
