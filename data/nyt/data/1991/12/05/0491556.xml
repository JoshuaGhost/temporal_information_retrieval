        <p>Four private gifts amounting to $85 million were announced today by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center here, including three donations of $25 million or more each that are considered to be among the largest ever made to a public university.</p>
        <p>Much of the money will be used to expand the institution's research in molecular biology, which in recent years has led to advances in treatments for arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and cancer under programs headed by two of the center's three Nobel laureates, Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein.</p>

        <p>Four private gifts amounting to $85 million were announced today by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center here, including three donations of $25 million or more each that are considered to be among the largest ever made to a public university.</p>
        <p>Much of the money will be used to expand the institution's research in molecular biology, which in recent years has led to advances in treatments for arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and cancer under programs headed by two of the center's three Nobel laureates, Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein.</p>
        <p>"These new gifts represent a giant step forward in our efforts to build our biomedical research programs," said Dr. Kern Wildenthal, president of medical center. Some money will also finance research centers under construction or planned, he said.</p>
        <p>The three largest gifts came from Nancy Hamon, a Dallas philanthropist; an unidentified donor, and the Excellence in Education Foundation. The Dallas-based foundation, which was established by the co-founders of Texas Instruments Inc., the semiconductor manufacturer, J. Erik Jonsson, Cecil H. Green and Eugene McDermott, gave $30 million; the other two gifts were reported to be $25 million.</p>
        <p>The Southwestern Medical Foundation, the fourth of the benefactors, gave $5 million.</p>
        <p>The contributions are part of the medical center's campaign to raise $150 million from private donors, plus $100 million now pledged by the Texas Legislature, to expand research in genetic science headed by Drs. Goldstein and Brown.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brown said in an interview that many recent breakthroughs in treatments for cancer, heart disease, cystic fibrosis and other diseases had their origins in the ability of medical scientists to isolate and study genes. "The school has shown in recent years that we can excel in this research," he said.</p>
        <p>The three large contributions announced today, combined with gifts to the medical center of $41 million and $20 million in recent years, represent the five largest separate gifts to any public medical school, according to the Chronicle for Higher Education.</p>
