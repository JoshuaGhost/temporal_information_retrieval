        <p>The United Nations envoy who has been negotiating the fate of Western hostages in Lebanon is expected to visit Bonn on Thursday, officials said, in the wake of reports suggesting that the two remaining hostages, both Germans, may soon be freed.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in a statement that the envoy, Giandomenico Picco, would be here to discuss "the fate of German hostages."</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, German officials appealed to journalists not to press for details.</p>
        <p>In recent days, there have been conflicting reports suggesting that secret negotiations over the two German hostages may be under way. Goverment spokesmen have refused to confirm or deny those reports.</p>
        <p>"Our position is that now as in the past, we support the efforts of the U.N. Secretary General to free all the hostages, including our two Germans," a Foreign Ministry official said today.</p>
        <p>The German hostages, Thomas Kemptner and Heinrich Strubig, were working for an aid organization in the Lebanese town of Sidon when they were kidnapped in 1989.</p>
        <p>The two prisoners whose freedom the kidnappers are seeking are two brothers, Mohammed Ali and Abbas Hamadi, who are jailed in Germany.</p>
        <p>Mohammed Hamadi is serving a life term for his role in the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines flight in 1985. The hijacked plane was held in Beirut and Algiers for a total of 17 days. One passenger, United States Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem, was killed and his body dumped onto the tarmac at Beirut International Airport.</p>
        <p>The Hamadis were arrested in and sentenced by Germany and in 1989, the two German hostages were seized in Lebanon.</p>
