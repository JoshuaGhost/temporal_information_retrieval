        <p>At Pat Friedman's house, the green-shingled Cape Cod on Roxbury Road South, the one with the tiny lot where the trees are bedecked with blue ribbon, property taxes have been rising, but not without a fight.</p>
        <p>For most of the last three decades -- as her property taxes have gone from $550 a year to nearly $5,500 -- Mrs. Friedman has been one of a small band of activists who have crisscrossed Long Island, railing, often in vain, against slothful government and soaring property taxes.</p>
        <p>But now, as unemployment and recession continue their rampage through the region and across the country, and fear routs optimism, the anti-tax prophets have come in from the wilderness. An Attitude Changed</p>
        <p>"Over the years they have called us gadflies and worse, but they don't view us that way now," said Mrs. Friedman as she sat on her living-room couch, holding a 100-yard reel of blue ribbon and plotting the next step in a campaign to roll back county taxes.</p>
        <p>In Nassau County, where protests are rare and people usually prefer tending their gardens to attending public meetings, the anti-tax movement has reached the highest pitch since the late 1970's when a move to limit taxes in California sparked copycat efforts across the suburbs.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, blue ribbons, the new symbols of the anti-tax movement, have begun appearing on lightpoles near public buildings here, a talk show host has collected 7,000 signatures on anti-tax petitions and Democrats, abetted by Rita Mezzapelle and her Tax Cut Party, made important gains in the County Legislature.</p>
        <p>And in another sign of the times, tax foes have gained control over several school boards that had passed sharp tax increases in response to state aid cuts. Mrs. Friedman, the president of the Garden City South Civic Association, was swept into office as the president of the Franklin Square school district and immediately set about cutting spending, consolidating classes and laying off teachers. Hundreds Protest</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night Mrs. Friedman joined with hundreds of other people, some wearing blue ribbons and carrying blue balloons, who descended on a county budget hearing to protest proposals to increase property taxes 25 percent and impose a new sales tax on home heating oil.</p>
        <p>Outside, thousands of county workers picketed, demanding that the county rescind furloughs ordered for more than 10,000 county workers, a move that could put pressure on the county to raise taxes even further.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Mrs. Friedman, the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, declared that he "enthusiastically" supported the goals of a tax revolt rally she organized, and declared that local government, including the county he has headed for nearly five years, "must be completely overhauled."</p>
        <p>"The time for talk is over," he wrote. "The time for action is now!"</p>
        <p>What is going on recalls the events in 1978, when a county budget hearing overflowed with people fighting increases in property taxes and calling for the repeal of the home heating oil tax that was, in fact, swiftly repealed. That is the same tax Mr. Gulotta proposed reimposing this year, only to change his mind a few days later.  'A Lot of Anger Out There'</p>
        <p>"There is a lot of anger out there," said Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, who was a leader of the earlier tax protest. "It seems that all that has changed from the last tax revolt to this tax revolt is that the taxes have gone up."</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Friedman and other longtime civic leaders say that much more has changed. In the past, they said, tax protests mainly stirred the passions and shook the pocketbooks of elderly homeowners living on fixed incomes. This time, they say, the business establishment -- in its own restrained way -- has joined in the tax revolt.</p>
        <p>"Long Island's economy is hurting," said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, a business group, at Tuesday night's hearing. "Business and residents are suffering. The absolute last thing we need are more taxes."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Friedman became troubled over property taxes as she watched members of her civic association struggle to pay their bills. The wife of an electrician foreman, she raised two children before going back to school in her 40's. She graduated summa cum laude from Adelphi University after serving as president of the adult student government.</p>
        <p>For years, she said, most homeowners ignored complaints about rising taxes because home values were rising at the same time. But that changed when real estate values began to tumble.</p>
        <p>The elderly, fed up with taxes, used to be able to sell their homes and move. Now they are stuck. One elderly woman in Hempstead, Mrs. Friedman said, continues to give piano lessons simply to pay her tax bills on a house she has been unable to sell. She said the woman, who received $5,000 in Social Security payments last year, paid $6,000 in property taxes. This year her school taxes are to go up by $786.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Friedman sees herself as a member of the permanent loyal opposition to the party in power, especially during decades when the Republican Party dominates local government, and the Democrats are all but irrelevant. Her main goal now: replace all property taxes with a tax on income.</p>
        <p>Other anti-tax activists have moved from civic groups to politics, out of frustration. Rita Mezzapelle, the publisher of The Elmont Herald, founded the Tax Cut Party three years ago after seeing her complaints as civic leader either ignored or studied to death.</p>
        <p>In November the party helped a Democrat, Assemblyman Lewis J. Yevoli, defeat an incumbent Republican as Supervisor for the Town of Oyster Bay, a move that gave Democrats veto power over county spending for the first time in more than 70 years.</p>
        <p>While the Republicans see the Tax Cut party as a tool of the Democrats, Ms. Mezzapelle said, her goal is to re-establish a balance of power between the parties as a way of controlling spending. She said her party was prepared to support right-thinking Republicans as well. An Activist Radio Host</p>
        <p>And then there is the role played by "Good Morning, Long Island," a new talk show on two Long Island radio stations, WGSM in Huntington and WGBB in Freeport, that took the tax issue to the air for four hours a day for almost all of last week.</p>
        <p>Paul Lyle, the show's host, brought a dozen turkeys to a meeting of the Suffolk County Legislature at which 12 legislators raised taxes by overriding the County Executive's veto. He placed a half-page ad that cost $12,000 in Newsday, asking readers to send back an anti-tax coupon. He said he received 7,000 responses.</p>
        <p>"We found that tax increases were at the point where they were causing strangulation," he said. "I get calls from people every day saying, 'I don't know if I can keep living here, I may have to get out.' "</p>
