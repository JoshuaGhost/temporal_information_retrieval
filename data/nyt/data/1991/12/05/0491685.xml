        <p>Maurice John Vaughan  Chicago Blues 73 Eighth Avenue, at 13th Street Manhattan Through tonight</p>
        <p>Maurice John Vaughan called his debut album "Generic Blues" (Alligator-Independent), but he was being self-deprecating. In current Chicago blues, it's downright eccentric for Mr. Vaughan to play a hollow-body electric guitar, plucking the strings with his fingernails, and to include a trombonist in the four-piece band he has brought to Chicago Blues. Nor does Mr. Vaughan stick to tried-and-true lyrics. One of the toughest songs he sang on Tuesday night was "Computer Took My Job Away," a new version of the no-work blues carried by a modal vamp akin to John Lee Hooker</p>

        <p>Maurice John Vaughan  Chicago Blues 73 Eighth Avenue, at 13th Street Manhattan Through tonight</p>
        <p>Maurice John Vaughan called his debut album "Generic Blues" (Alligator-Independent), but he was being self-deprecating. In current Chicago blues, it's downright eccentric for Mr. Vaughan to play a hollow-body electric guitar, plucking the strings with his fingernails, and to include a trombonist in the four-piece band he has brought to Chicago Blues. Nor does Mr. Vaughan stick to tried-and-true lyrics. One of the toughest songs he sang on Tuesday night was "Computer Took My Job Away," a new version of the no-work blues carried by a modal vamp akin to John Lee Hooker</p>
        <p>As with that song, Mr. Vaughan's way of updating the blues looks simultaneously back and into the present. With his small but supple voice, he gives phrases a rasp or a rhythmic twist to make them more cutting, or he doubles his vocal line with a guitar unison, although that can obscure the words. But his sparse, incisive guitar playing carries the songs. He plucks out wiry chords that echo rural blues, strums quick chords with a touch of big-band jazz, answers his own vocal lines with sly twangs, or plays terse, sighing single-note leads, all old-fashioned techniques but potent ones, abetted by a crisply efficient band.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, Mr. Vaughan was a garrulous performer, joking more than his songs needed and tossing off slightly dated references to things like disco and break-dancing. But when he settled into the hard-luck story of a song like "The Big Bad Circle," the music stung.</p>
