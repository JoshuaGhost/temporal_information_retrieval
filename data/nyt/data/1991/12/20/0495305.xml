        <p>To listen to Cachao is to hear a virtuoso of rhythm, and a charismatic one at that. Cachao (pronounced cuh-CHOW), the 72-year-old bassist whose formal name is Israel Lopez, slaps the bass, plucking the strings until they snap against the neck, piercing through the percussive tumult of an orchestra. During repeated bass figures he starts varying the rhythms until they seem in danger of collapsing on one another.</p>
        <p>As a salsa orchestra swirls around him, Mr. Lopez organizes the flow of the music with improvisations that drive the orchestra on without ever relying on unadorned repetitions. He's the type of musician whose presence makes the rest of the band play better.</p>

        <p>To listen to Cachao is to hear a virtuoso of rhythm, and a charismatic one at that. Cachao (pronounced cuh-CHOW), the 72-year-old bassist whose formal name is Israel Lopez, slaps the bass, plucking the strings until they snap against the neck, piercing through the percussive tumult of an orchestra. During repeated bass figures he starts varying the rhythms until they seem in danger of collapsing on one another.</p>
        <p>As a salsa orchestra swirls around him, Mr. Lopez organizes the flow of the music with improvisations that drive the orchestra on without ever relying on unadorned repetitions. He's the type of musician whose presence makes the rest of the band play better.</p>
        <p>Tonight at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts in Bedford Park, the Bronx, and tomorrow at Alice Tully Hall, as part of the Jazz at Lincoln Center program, Mr. Lopez will be leading 2 groups: a 24-piece orchestra and a smaller group for a jam session. This division isn't an accident: in Cuba in the late 1930's, Mr. Lopez and his brother, Orestes, were among the first musicians to break the formality of the danzon form, a popular style of music meant for dancing. By heating it up and stretching it out, Mr. Lopez and his brother transformed the style into what became known as the mambo. And the jam session, called a descarga, was made popular by a series of records Mr. Lopez recorded in the 1950's that broke down the orchestra and had small groups playing Afro-Cuban music with the improvisational flavor of jazz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopez comes from one of the most distinguished musical families in Cuba, and to talk to him is a way into a Cuba that no longer exists. At one time, Mr. Lopez could count nearly 50 relatives who were playing music in Cuba, and he and his father and brother were members of the Havana Philharmonic; in 1905, his grandfather went to Boston with a band that won the title of the best group in the world. One snapshot has a 12-year-old Israel Lopez standing on a box performing with the orchestra.  'People Playing All the Time'</p>
        <p>"Our house was a wreck, with instruments everywhere," Mr. Lopez said. "There were people playing all the time."</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lopez and his brother began to tinker with the basics of Afro-Cuban music, their music wasn't accepted by the dancing public. Mr. Lopez's brother wrote a tune called "Chanchullo," which incorporated new and hotter rhythms, but it took almost a year before people could adapt to the faster and more rhythmic style.</p>
        <p>"The danzon being played was the traditional music," Mr. Lopez said. "We were playing in the symphony; we played 24 hours a day when I was young. So classical music is in the blood. It's very important. But the popular music was very good because I felt it. It had rhythm, and rhythm is the most important part of Afro-Cuban music.</p>
        <p>"It was 1937 when we figured out the mambo, and because we were young we were looking for something new, looking to create a new music, to extend the danzon. And at first, people didn't understand what we had done: it was too fast and too hot. But then people learned how to dance to it."</p>
        <p>Rene Lopez, a record producer and musicologist who will be giving short lectures before the shows, said Mr. Lopez's inventions changed Afro-Cuban music and had political significance as well.</p>
        <p>"The danzon part of the concert is important because they and the mambos were the vehicle with which Cachao introduced the music of the world -- jazz, Tin Pan Alley -- into music structures popular in Cuba," Mr. Lopez said. "The Cuban dancing public, usually black and working class, wouldn't listen to 'Rhapsody in Blue,' or 'Stormy Weather.' He put them in a mambo form, and the result helped broaden the scope of culture in Cuba."  A Popular Format</p>
        <p>Half the concerts will be devoted to the danzones and mambos Mr. Lopez has composed, played by an orchestra that will be digging back into the 1930's. The second half is to be a jam session, which, like the first half, will feature the saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, the flutist Nestor Torres, the trumpeter Chocolate Armenteros and the percussionist Orlando (Puntilla) Rios.</p>
        <p>"I think the jam sessions are important because they popularized the small-group format for listening in Cuba," said Mr. Lopez, the musicologist. "In Cuba, it's basically a dancing public and Cachao took the private jam session -- usually for musicians only and after hours -- and recorded it, a real departure from the norm."</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopez, the bassist, said: "I love a big orchestra. There are so many resources and so many colors. I don't get to do this enough, but I love it."</p>
        <p>Tonight's show, which starts at 8, will be at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, Bedford Park Boulevard West and Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx; tickets are $12, $16 and $30. Information: (212) 960-8833. Tomorrow's show, at Alice Tully Hall, will be at 8 P.M.; remaining tickets are $30; information: (212) 721-6500.</p>
