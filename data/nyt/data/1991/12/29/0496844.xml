        <p>Organizers of Pasadena's annual Rose Bowl parade thought they'd upstage all the quincentenary hoopla over Christopher Columbus by picking his descendant and namesake Cristobal Colon as their 1992 grand marshal. The New Year's Day procession, dubbed "Voyages of Discovery," would be the kickoff to a year of hero worship, they figured.</p>
        <p>They didn't figure enough. In the minds of some Americans, Columbus rates no worship, and they certainly don't concede that he "discovered" anything. These dissenters are, of course, Native American Indians, whose ancestors were here first -- indeed, first by thousands of years. To them, Christopher Columbus symbolizes neither exploration nor heroism, but imperialism and genocide.</p>

        <p>They didn't figure enough. In the minds of some Americans, Columbus rates no worship, and they certainly don't concede that he "discovered" anything. These dissenters are, of course, Native American Indians, whose ancestors were here first -- indeed, first by thousands of years. To them, Christopher Columbus symbolizes neither exploration nor heroism, but imperialism and genocide.</p>
        <p>As quick as you can say Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, Native Americans protested the choice of a Colon from Madrid. At first, the Tournament of Roses people stood firm; they've weathered lots of protests since the first parade in 1890. But last month they agreed to</p>
        <p>two</p>
        <p>grand marshals -- Senor Colon in an open car, and Representative Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, a Cheyenne and the only Native American in Congress, on horseback in native dress. The organizers even have the two men taking turns leading the flowery floats.</p>
        <p>All's well that ends well. Wednesday's doubly marshaled parade will shed needed light on America's history.</p>
