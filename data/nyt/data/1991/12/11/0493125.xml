        <p>Arab and Israeli negotiators finally met today for a second round of Middle East peace talks, with Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon holding substantive exchanges, but the Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians wrangling over who sits at which table.</p>
        <p>Six days after the date the United States proposed for the parties to get together to follow up their first direct talks in Madrid last month, the Arab and Israeli negotiators gathered at their appointed rooms in the State Department this morning.</p>
        <p>The Israelis and Syrians spent the two-and-a-half-hour morning session essentially rehashing their different interpretations of United Nations Resolution 242. Syrians Urge Withdrawal</p>
        <p>The Syrians, officials said, argued that Resolution 242 enjoins the Israelis to unilaterally and unconditionally withdraw from the Golan Heights, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. After such an Israeli withdrawal, which needs no coordination with Syria, Damascus would be ready to talk to the Israelis about "peace in the Middle East," Syria's chief negotiator, Muwaffak Allaf, told the Israelis.</p>
        <p>"We are offering peace for territory occupied by Israel," he said as he arrived at the State Department. "We are offering peace for ourselves and for them."</p>
        <p>The Israeli chief negotiator, Yosef Ben-Aharon, declined to commit Israel to any territorial concession on the Golan Heights, since the Israelis argue that while Resolution 242 calls on them to surrender territories occupied in the 1967 war, it does not specify "all" the territories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben-Aharon told reporters afterward that he focused on trying to determine whether the Syrians "are willing to accept Israel's right to exist and its legitimacy, and whether they are willing to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations." Another Meeting Scheduled</p>
        <p>The Syrians insisted that they were prepared to continue talking with the Israelis, but that the negotiations must remain in Washington and not transfer to the Middle East, where the Israelis want them moved. They have scheduled another meeting for Wednesday.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry I cannot report for you any progress," Mr. al-Allaf said. "Rather it's been a repetition of the same attitude by the Israelis as in Madrid, trying to talk about everything except for withdrawal from territories, rejecting the possibility of land for peace."</p>
        <p>In the intricate tapestry of Middle East politics there were a few intriguing nuances to these talks. It is something of an advance for a Syrian diplomat to declare in public that "we are offering peace for territory," since in the past Damascus has tended to emphasize only the need for an Israeli withdrawal, with the rest left open, or at most offering the Israelis co-existence.</p>
        <p>Israeli reporters said Syrian spokesmen in Washington have also answered all of their questions, in contrast to the behavior of some of the Syrian spokesmen in Madrid, who would ignore Israeli journalists altogether.</p>
        <p>Also, the Syrians and Lebanese agreed to open their talks with the Israelis this morning, despite the fact that the Jordanian-Palestinian talks did not get under way as scheduled. This suggested that there might be less coordination between Arab delegations, once the talks get going, than previously presumed. A Warm Handshake</p>
        <p>On Monday, the chief Jordanian negotiator, Dr. Abdul Salam Majali, addressed an audience of Middle experts at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Studies, in which the Israeli Ambassador, Zalman Shoval, and other Israeli officials were present. Mr. Shoval and Mr. Majali warmly shook hands at the start of the lecture.</p>
        <p>Of all the negotiations, the Israeli-Lebanese talks seemed to get off to the best start. Yosef Hadass, co-chairman of the Israeli delegation, began by making a statement saying: "Israel has no territorial designs over Lebanon. All we seek is security for the northern part of Israel."</p>
        <p>Lebanese officials said they took note of these statements and met again with the Israelis for a second session in the afternoon to try to establish an agenda for their coming sessions. Israeli officials said they got the impression that the Lebanese had been given a certain degree of elbowroom from the Syrians, who dominate the Beirut Government's decision-making.</p>
        <p>The negotiation that probably has the most likelihood of producing some sort of agreement sometime in the future -- that between the Israelis and the Jordanian-Palestinian team -- failed to get beyond procedural wrangling today. Who Sits Where?</p>
        <p>The Palestinian delegates insisted when they arrived at the State Department on negotiating with the Israelis as a distinct and separate delegation -- not jointly with the Jordanians -- to underscore their view that the solution to their problem must also be as a separate entity and not in the context of Jordan.</p>
        <p>The Israeli delegation insisted that the talks open with Israel on one side of the table and the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation together on the other side. After such an opening, the Israelis said they would be prepared to split into working groups to deal with the different issues that apply to Jordanians and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The Israelis argued that not only is that the way the American-Soviet invitation to the Madrid conference established things, but also because they want to make their point that the solution to the Palestinian problem must be in the overall Jordanian context and not as a separate entity.</p>
        <p>Israel's chief negotiator for these talks, Elie Rubinstein, spent three hours in the morning seated on a bench in the corridor of the State Department, talking with chief Palestinian negotiator Haidar Abdel-Shafi and chief Jordanian negotiator Dr. Majali, trying to reach a mutually acceptable accomodation. The Palestinians and Israelis sat in the hall because neither side would enter the conference room or rooms until the issue was settled as to who would sit where. A First Agreement</p>
        <p>While they spoke, the other members of their delegations avoided one another, until the State Department brought in some coffee. Israel's Ambassador, Mr. Shoval, offered a cup to one of the Palestinian delegates and said: "I think there is one thing we can agree on: the coffee is terrible." After that the ice was broken and the various delegates mingled in the corridor.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, the two delegations met for a second time.</p>
        <p>American officials said they got the sense that both sides are still testing each other, and neither appeared at the end of the day today to be ready to offer a creative compromise to get around this procedural dispute.</p>
        <p>"The bad news is that they are still arguing about the shape of the table," said an American official. "The good news is that they spent all day together doing it -- without us getting involved. These guys are here, they are talking to each other and we are not leaping in."</p>
