        <p>Joseph D. Pikus, a longtime professor of health science at Jersey City State College, died on Sunday. He was 75 years old and lived in Cedar Grove, N.J.</p>
        <p>He died of stomach cancer, his family said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pikus, whose doctorate from Columbia University was in education, joined the college faculty in 1973, retired as a full-time professor of health science in 1986 and then became an adjunct professor of health science and sociology. He was active in that part-time post until last month.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pikus (pronounced PICK-us) grew up in Pine Brook, N.J. He is survived by his wife, Lila, a psychotherapist; two sons, David H. of Short Hills and Dr. Anthony A., a physician, of Marblehead, Mass, and a granddaughter.</p>
