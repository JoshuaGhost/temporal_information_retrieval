        <p>"Extended Metal," the hourlong work that the Shelley Lee Dance Company brought to the Merce Cunningham Studio last Saturday night, was notable for the power of its music and the talent of its cast. Although it eventually proved deficient in one crucial respect, its virtues deserve to be mentioned first.</p>
        <p>Bruce Odland's score, which combined electronic sounds with live percussion sequences, played by Mark McCoin and the composer, was based on noises collected one evening when Mr. Odland attached a microphone to the wheels of a car traveling across New York's bridges. The music rattled, scraped, thumped and buzzed, yet its clamor never punished one's ears.</p>

        <p>"Extended Metal," the hourlong work that the Shelley Lee Dance Company brought to the Merce Cunningham Studio last Saturday night, was notable for the power of its music and the talent of its cast. Although it eventually proved deficient in one crucial respect, its virtues deserve to be mentioned first.</p>
        <p>Bruce Odland's score, which combined electronic sounds with live percussion sequences, played by Mark McCoin and the composer, was based on noises collected one evening when Mr. Odland attached a microphone to the wheels of a car traveling across New York's bridges. The music rattled, scraped, thumped and buzzed, yet its clamor never punished one's ears.</p>
        <p>It certainly created an exciting sonic landscape through which the cast moved with authority. The imperious Brenda Daniels was always secure, and Ty Boomershine, Keith Chamberlain, Barbara Grubel, Martha Connerton, Fionuala Power and Samuel Wursten were strong and precise.</p>
        <p>What, then, did "Extended Metal" lack? The flyer that the company distributed to advertise its performance suggests what was missing. This announcement included a drawing by Jose Guadalupe Posada showing a grimly determined skeletal warrior galloping along on a skeletal horse while tiny skeletons tumble about on all sides of him. The illustration is simultaneously eerie and grotesquely comic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee's choreography never matched its power. If anything, "Extended Metal" lost momentum as it proceeded. Its restless opening solo, in which Ms. Connerton rolled and twisted on the floor, hinted that the production would be rich in conflicts. So did a duet for Ms. Connerton and Ms. Power in which Ms. Power initially appeared weak, then gained assurance.</p>
        <p>But much of the choreography throughout the piece lacked urgency. The thunder of the music hinted at approaching storms that never materialized in the action on stage. Nor did Ms. Lee make her company struggle to defy the musical storms. Although the dancers' finely honed techniques were certainly admirable, one began to long for a few unruly choreographic skeletons.</p>
