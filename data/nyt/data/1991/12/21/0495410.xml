        <p>Emerging from a maze of political taboos, illusions and restrictions, the people of Taiwan vote Saturday in their first full general election in four decades, a free and bitter electoral brawl that will shape this island's future for years or decades to come.</p>

        <p>Emerging from a maze of political taboos, illusions and restrictions, the people of Taiwan vote Saturday in their first full general election in four decades, a free and bitter electoral brawl that will shape this island's future for years or decades to come.</p>
        <p>The vote will elect National Assembly members who will revise the Constitution and, if the opposition has its way, perhaps the country's name, flag, territory and relationship with China.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of the new freedom that has arisen in Taiwan in the last few years that the dominant issue in the campaign, blared over megaphones at rallies everywhere, violates the ultimate taboo on Taiwan. The issue is "taidu," the idea that Taiwan should give up its claims of sovereignty over China and instead declare itself to be a new "Republic of Taiwan" independent of China.</p>
        <p>The ruling Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, is universally expected to win most of the seats, and so such drastic changes are unlikely. But this is the first time that such ideas have been discussed so openly, the first time that Taiwan has held an election that will make a difference, and indeed the first time that any Chinese society has ever held such a free and competitive multi-party election.</p>
        <p>"The significance of this election is that it offers the possibility of revolutionary change, without revolution," said Diane Y. P. Ying, publisher of a prominent Taiwan magazine called Commonwealth. Debating Identity and Future</p>
        <p>The idea of Taiwan's independence is a heresy to the Governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the Government in Beijing has threatened to invade Taiwan if there is any declaration of independence. In Taiwan, advocating independence is nominally banned, and a few people are in jail for supporting it, but in general the Government has not much enforced the ban. In speeches, posters and newspaper advertisements, some candidates openly call for independence.</p>
        <p>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party does not expect to win, and so there is almost no chance of an imminent declaration of independence. But the issue has stirred a profound debate.</p>
        <p>"This election is very important because the D.P.P. is pushing hard for independence," said Jaw Shau-kang, a prominent Kuomintang politician who is now chief of Taiwan's Environmental Protection Agency. "The election results will be an indication of how people feel about independence."</p>
        <p>If the Democratic Progressive Party gains more than 30 percent of the votes, roughly the proportion it won in supplementary elections in 1989, then a result is likely to be growing pressure for independence -- and mounting threats of invasion from Beijing.</p>
        <p>Once ruled dictatorially by Chiang Kai-shek and then by his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, Taiwan has undergone a metamorphosis since the late 1980's. The authorities have lifted martial law, allowed opposition parties, ended press restrictions, permitted travel to the Chinese mainland and ended past practices like torture and even occasional killing of political opponents.</p>
        <p>The debate over independence may seem puzzling from afar, since Taiwan is clearly not under the control of China. But one illusion that the Kuomintang and the Communists have always agreed on is that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China -- even though they disagree about which of the two parties is its legitimate government. Dwindling Interest</p>
        <p>The Kuomintang fled to Taiwan in 1949, after being defeated by the Communists in China's civil war. From Taiwan, the Kuomintang has periodically growled about how it would "recover the mainland" and has continued to call itself the "Republic of China." But now power has devolved into the hands of the 85 percent of the island's 20 million people who are Taiwanese rather than refugees from the mainland, and many have no interest in recovering the mainland. China's Stance</p>
        <p>Hsu Hsin-liang, a former political prisoner and exile who is now chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, said that while there was some risk of attack from the mainland, this tended to be exaggerated.</p>
        <p>In an interview in Beijing this month, a senior official in charge of Taiwan affairs, Tang Shubei, said China would not interfere in the election in Taiwan but was very concerned about the advocacy of independence by Taiwan's opposition candidates. Mr. Tang reiterated that China would like to reunite with Taiwan peacefully, but that it reserved the right to use military force.</p>
        <p>"We want the people of Taiwan to have more democracy," Mr. Tang said. "But this should not interfere with Taiwan's status as a part of China."</p>
        <p>Taiwan has held elections periodically, but they were only for a few "supplemental" seats in parliamentary bodies dominated by aging representatives elected from constituencies in mainland China in the 1940's. Thus the past elections in Taiwan could never affect the balance of power. But this week the last of the mainland "senior representatives" -- or "old thieves," as the opposition parties call them -- resigned their seats.</p>
        <p>A result is that the new National Assembly will be made up entirely of delegates elected on Taiwan, and the election on Saturday marks the first time that the Kuomintang is entirely trusting the voters with its future.</p>
