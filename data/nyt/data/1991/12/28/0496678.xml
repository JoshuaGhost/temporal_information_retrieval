        <p>The Japanese trade surplus is soaring again. It will probably hit a record $100 billion for 1991 and rise even higher in 1992. Japan now has the only sizable surplus, with Europe as well as the United States running large deficits.</p>
        <p>Two steps are urgently required. First, the value of the yen should be raised substantially. In addition, the Japanese must be encouraged to end the recent stagnation in their domestic spending, which has led to renewed reliance on exports.</p>
        <p>The grossly undervalued yen is now weaker than at the end of 1987. But a lot has happened to improve Japan's competitive position. Its inflation has run 8 to 10 percentage points less than American inflation in this four-year period (about 2 percent a year versus America's 4.5 percent). At the same time, Japanese productivity has grown by 8 to 10 percentage points more -- about 5 percent annually from 1987 to 1991 compared with 3 percent for the U.S. This means the yen is now undervalued in trade terms by 15 to 20 percent. Correcting this should cut the Japanese surplus by $30 billion to $50 billion.</p>
        <p>President Bush should therefore work out an agreement with Japan to strengthen the yen to about 100 to 1 against the dollar from its current level of about 125 to 1. Clear statements and joint intervention in currency markets by the Group of Seven industrial nations should be enough to start the bandwagon rolling. A similar strategy in 1985-87 succeeded, so we know that currency changes will promote a turnaround.</p>
        <p>The second immediate cause of Japan's trade surge is an abrupt slowdown in domestic spending as an engine for expansion. After five years of rising domestic demand for imports -- a period in which its surplus declined by more than 5 percent of its real gross national product -- Japan's internal spending has stagnated for the past six months. As a result, import growth is flat and Japan is once again relying on exports.</p>
        <p>President Bush must therefore seek a Japanese commitment to restore domestic expansion, each percentage point of which would cut Japan's surplus by about $3 billion. Japanese national and local government combined is running a sizable surplus. Hence it can stimulate the economy through new tax cuts and spending that will improve living standards. It is incomprehensible that the Japanese bureaucracy is now contemplating new tax increases instead, which must be firmly rejected.</p>
        <p>America cannot blame Japan for its present recession or more fundamental economic woes. The U.S. will restore solid and sustained growth only when it deals decisively with its own basic internal problems.</p>
        <p>But Japan's soaring trade surplus indicates that production and jobs are being created there at the expense of growth in the rest of the world, much of which is stagnating, rather than through domestic spending on better housing and other amenities desperately needed by the Japanese people.</p>
        <p>These trade patterns are particularly critical for the U.S because its recovery depends heavily on trade gains: our huge deficit precludes higher Government spending to expand the economy and the financial system's fragility is stifling any stimulating impact of low interest rates. If the Japanese trade excess continues, new protectionist actions are likely.</p>
        <p>Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa carried out a plan in 1986-87 like the one proposed here when he was Finance Minister working with then Treasury Secretary James Baker. Mr. Miyazawa could make a dramatic contribution to the world economy and U.S.-Japan relations by initiating such steps with President Bush. His doing so would show that Japan was finally ready to accept the global responsibilities that must accompany its economic success.</p>
