        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Putting Doctors Into Cost-Containment," (Forum, Nov. 24) levels scalding charges against the American health care system. While most physicians would agree with the need for increased cost-conservation, few would concur with the indictment by the author, Malik Hassan, of "cultural and societal values that often keep incurable patients alive." Modern medicine has as much obligation to minister to the health needs of "incurable patients" as any others -- even if their care incurs great costs and exacts an extraordinary emotional toll. To suggest that physicians abandon the duties and obligations entrusted in them by the Hippocratic and Maimonides Oaths out of concern for "cost-containment" is ludicrous. MARK A. YOUNG, M.D.  Baltimore, Nov. 24</p>
