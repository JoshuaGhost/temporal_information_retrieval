        <p>THE show at the Lehman College Art Gallery is of photographs by contemporary Russians, and it begins with a life-size blowup of nine artisans, which is not, however, hortatory Social Realism. Printed across several panels, the figures overlap Cubistically but otherwise the work is a straightforward if casual portrait of men standing in two rows, their expressions amiable and interested.</p>
        <p>They could be Americans except that all give the impression of having better things to do than commune with the camera. The title is "Cast Me Not Away From Thy Presence," which comes from the 51st Psalm, a prayer for the remission of sins and for sanctification. The picture was taken by Vladimir Kupreanov in 1987.</p>

        <p>THE show at the Lehman College Art Gallery is of photographs by contemporary Russians, and it begins with a life-size blowup of nine artisans, which is not, however, hortatory Social Realism. Printed across several panels, the figures overlap Cubistically but otherwise the work is a straightforward if casual portrait of men standing in two rows, their expressions amiable and interested.</p>
        <p>They could be Americans except that all give the impression of having better things to do than commune with the camera. The title is "Cast Me Not Away From Thy Presence," which comes from the 51st Psalm, a prayer for the remission of sins and for sanctification. The picture was taken by Vladimir Kupreanov in 1987.</p>
        <p>An earlier, less benign work by the same photographer features 16 telephone operators. Although no one looks good in interrogation-strength lighting, these women are so ordinary that they make the American photographer Lee Friedlander's office workers trapped at their word processors look glamorous by comparison. Mr. Friedlander lets the expressions of his subjects do all the work, but Mr. Kupreanov brings his point home with captions.</p>
        <p>Where the number would go in a mug shot, he appends a line from Pushkin, the Romantic poet who died prematurely in a duel and who became the object of an enduring cult. The Diane Arbus-style message is in the contrast between the plebeian faces and soaring thoughts like "Anew I am aflame; from out my eyes well tears." The other pictures by Mr. Kupreanov are regular color shots of family groups except that they are obscured by wrinkled tissue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kupreanov, 37, is the eldest of the four contributors to "The Missing Picture," a show of photographs that mark the end of Communism and, hence, are designated "alternative." It is the second such investigation to come out of the List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As before, John Jacob is the guest curator, and he has collaborated with the Moscow agency Soyuzkhudozexport.</p>
        <p>To judge from the atmosphere around this show and the companion retrospective by the Ukrainian photographer Boris Michailov, the Soviet Union is getting the returning-prodigal treatment. Not the least of these is a catalogue full of information but annoyingly laid out. It is set in sans-serif, the typeface that has come to signify importance, perhaps because it is so tiring to read. Nevertheless, it seems the appropriate choice here, because of its popularity with artists in the first Russian Revolution.</p>
        <p>Ilya Piganov, Maria Serebrjakova and Alexey Shulgin are the other photographers and, in their 20's, they stand even closer to the Conceptualism of the West than does Mr. Kupreanov. In fact, they can't really be identified as Russian, for the very rawness that marks some of their pictures is the quality that so many Westerners strive for. Likewise the hermeticism and sense that their viewers must be initiates in order to understand them.</p>
        <p>Take Maria Serebrjakova's 12 chairs, for example, which are Baroque skeletons without upholstery standing silvery white against black, each of them covered by a sheet of plexiglass that has a circular hole cut in it. The catalogue doesn't tell you that the photographer saw them on a trip to Italy and with them is alluding to the same 12-chair folk tale that Mel Brooks made a movie about. You have to know, also, that in her appropriated and altered landscapes, Ms.  Serebrjakova is commenting on the Mother Russia concept that was part and parcel of the old administration.</p>
        <p>Ilya Piganov prints on old photographic paper small images of everyday objects -- a camera, a cheese grater, worn-out boots, and the like -- adding an official looking number to each. He also presents larger gridded images, one of old stained pants with the zipper left open, another a scene of a nude bending over and surrounded by ornamental medallions of soldiers, an aviator and other heroic figures of the past. There is also an irregularly gridded portrait of a young woman that has the wistfulness of one of the "shingled" compositions by the Starn Twins.</p>
        <p>Alexey Shulgin's photographs are printed from negatives found in the archives of a construction firm, and who knows but that some of them document monster Government plans in action -- scenes of helmeted workers suspended in a cradle beside a tall building and huge pipes scattered over a bleak landscape. The blurred still life of food, flowers and a wine bottle may even represent the rewards reaped by management.</p>
        <p>These younger photographers began to flower during the thaw that preceded the dissolution of Communism, when camera clubs blossomed and unofficial art was making itself felt. But as a critic of the administration, Boris Michailov, born in 1938, was way ahead of them. A photographic restorer by trade, he amassed an archive of pictures that he has used as ammunition against the state but includes only a few in this show.</p>
        <p>His installation begins with a resume stating that his mother may have been Jewish, that he is not a party member and has never been charged with a crime but was once a "guest" of the KGB for photographing a "drunken dog" in front of a political demonstration. At the end of the statement, Mr. Michailov reports that he and his wife renovated their 10-foot by 10-foot room by painting it white -- to the tune of 100 rubles (a month's pay), and he includes pictures of himself stripped down apparently for this job.</p>
        <p>The pictures that follow are astonishing in their variety, quantity and, sometimes, quality. Although done in the 1970's and 80's, they have the quality of 1930's snapshots and not just because many are sepia toned.</p>
        <p>At Berdyansk, presumably a resort on the Black Sea, bathers abound, many of them shapely, like the three young men lying face down on a rock, their heads together, but some are testaments to drudgery and ill-advised eating. There are faces and forms that one might see in the Ukrainian neighborhoods of American cities -- the man in a white undershirt and black pants, for example, who stands at a sea wall, gesturing. One amusing color shot features a nude woman with red toenails. She lies in a net hammock, which turns her into a parcel of flesh. Mr. Michailov also adds color -- dramatically so in the two shots of bundled-up figures gathered in a room with a relief of Lenin's head on the wall.</p>
        <p>Among the works made with appropriated images and tinted is one of a soldier reverently cradling a doll and another of a blond baby -- or is this a doll, too? -- holding up her dress to reveal her anatomy (move over Robert Mapplethorpe). Though acknowledged as a major influence on the younger generation, Mr. Michailov has the humor and humanity that they seem to lack. He is in society up to the waist, while his followers keep their distance.</p>
        <p>Of course, this may be the typical reaction of a Western observer -- the kind that the Russian art historian Margarita Tupitsyn had in mind when, as quoted by Mr. Jacob, she wrote of Soviet art "as an ultimate exotic resort for a libidinal investment of Western Orientalist fantasies and bizarres." Ms. Tupitsyn evidently is unaware of the range of exotic choices available to Western sensibilities.</p>
        <p>All the artists have exhibited in Europe and the United States as well as in their own country, and most have been covered by American art publications. It is to be hoped that they will not lose their souls in the lemming-like rush for international fame and fortune. This fascinating and truly instructive show closes Saturday; (212) 960-8732.
