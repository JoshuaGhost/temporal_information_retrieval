        <p>L. William Krause, who stepped down as president and chief executive of the 3Com Corporation last year but remains chairman, said Wednesday that he had joined Storm Technology Inc., a start-up company involved in color computer-imaging, as president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Storm, based in Mountain View, Calif., is developing image-compression technology for producing high-quality color computer images; it has raised $3 million in venture financing.</p>
        <p>In addition to holding the chairmanship of 3Com, a computer networking company, Mr. Krause, 49, is chairman of the Pensoft Corporation, another start-up company, which is developing software for pen-based computers.</p>
        <p>He retired from daily operations at 3Com in September 1990. After spending one semester studying piano, German and statistics at a community college, he returned to work as a venture capitalist and adviser to various Silicon Valley companies.</p>
        <p>"I've discovered that I'm too young to retire, and that fundamentally I'm an entrepreneur at heart," Mr. Krause said in a telephone interview. "I still have the passion to build a new company."</p>
        <p>He said Storm was at a stage similar to where 3Com was when he joined in 1981. 3Com went on to become a technological leader in building networks of personal computers.</p>
        <p>During his tour as a venture capitalist, Mr. Krause said he became convinced that three areas of technology would be significant in the 1990's: global data networks, a focus for 3Com; mobile computing, which he is involved in through Pensoft, and compression technology, which would allow the integration of digital images on desktop computers, Storm's specialty.</p>
        <p>"It's an enormous market opportunity," Mr. Krause said. "The number of color pages being produced in the United States is going up exponentially."</p>
        <p>Without compression, color images require too much memory capacity for processing on personal computers. Storm's technology can compress color images by a factor of 20 times, so that a typical 4-inch-by-5-inch color photograph that requires 22 million bytes of storage is reduced to 1.1 million bytes.</p>
        <p>At Storm, Mr. Krause joins Adriaan Ligtenberg, the company's founder, vice president of engineering and chief technical officer, who developed image-compression technology at Bell Labs.</p>
        <p>Before joining 3Com, Mr. Krause spent more than 14 years at the Hewlett-Packard Company, where he was the first computer salesman for the company's Western region. He holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Citadel.</p>
