        <p>One of the six jurors in the William K. Smith rape trial said today that the jury had taken a secret ballot at the start of deliberations and that all jurors voted either "not guilty" or "undecided."</p>
        <p>"We walked in and everyone was very nervous, very insecure," said the juror, Lea Haller, in an interview at her home in the nearby town of Lake Worth. "Nobody had any idea what anybody else thought." But after the first ballot, she said, "it was easier from there on out."</p>

        <p>One of the six jurors in the William K. Smith rape trial said today that the jury had taken a secret ballot at the start of deliberations and that all jurors voted either "not guilty" or "undecided."</p>
        <p>"We walked in and everyone was very nervous, very insecure," said the juror, Lea Haller, in an interview at her home in the nearby town of Lake Worth. "Nobody had any idea what anybody else thought." But after the first ballot, she said, "it was easier from there on out."</p>
        <p>Ms. Haller, a 37-year-old cosmetics executive, listed several pieces of evidence that she said helped persuade her that Mr. Smith was not guilty. "There was nothing on the dress," she said. "What was the mystery of the nylons? What about all the screaming? Nobody heard it. Where were the scratches and abrasions from the fall?"</p>
        <p>As for the defendant, she said, "His story supported the evidence much more than hers did, and his testimony didn't seem nearly as contrived."  What If?</p>
        <p>None of the five other jurors responded today when a reporter knocked on their doors. But one, Doris Welsch, 60, told Reuters in a telephone interview that "I thought I made a good decision, and everyone else seems to think so, too."</p>
        <p>Ms. Haller was asked if some jurors might have believed Mr. Smith was guilty but lacked the evidence necessary to convict him. "I didn't pick that up if there was and I can't speak for that," she said.</p>
        <p>Much has been made of the judge's ruling before the trial that jurors could not hear testimony from three women who came forward to say that Mr. Smith sexually assaulted them, or tried to, years ago. Ms. Haller, who learned of the women's accusations after the verdict, said that testimony would probably not have persuaded her to vote differently.</p>
        <p>"You know," she said, "it's like if you win the lottery, everybody in the world remembers when you owed them $10." She added: "If you are going to bring out his background, his sexual history, then you've got to bring out hers, to be fair. And then everybody would have thrown a fit if you brought out hers. So where do you draw the line?" Senator's Influence</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's chief defense lawyer, Roy E. Black, gave several interviews and news conferences yesterday. At one, he said the big mistake made by the prosecutor, Moira K. Lasch, was calling Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as a witness.</p>
        <p>"I was watching those jurors," Mr. Black was quoted by The Associated Press as saying. "They were transfixed. They had tears in their eyes."</p>
        <p>The defense lawyer said the accuser, too, had been an effective witness. "Her testimony was the most dramatic I've ever seen, virtually impossible to cross-examine," the A.P. quoted Mr. Black as saying.</p>
