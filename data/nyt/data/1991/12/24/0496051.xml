        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was disappointed by your Dec. 9 editorial proclaiming airline deregulation a success. Deregulation has produced in the United States:</p>
        <p>* Five major airlines, 25 percent of the national fleet capacity, are in bankruptcy, including the two to which deregulation gave birth -- America West and Midway (Midway ceased operations this year, along with Eastern and Pan American).</p>
        <p>* After 200 bankruptcies and 50 mergers, we now fly the oldest and most repainted fleet of aircraft in the developed world.</p>
        <p>* The market share of the four largest airlines has grown by 14 percent in five years, to two-thirds -- a rate of concentration unparalleled in American business history.</p>
        <p>* More than 50,000 airline employees have lost their jobs since Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>* All the United States passenger airlines together are now worth less than Japan Air Lines individually.</p>
        <p>Deregulation was supposed to produce more competition. But under deregulation, 13 major railroads folded into 7; 2 bus lines became 1, and two-thirds of the general freight trucking companies disappeared with no significant new entry.</p>
        <p>From the late 1970's, Congress and the White House deregulated a host of industries. Free-market economists assured us that if we amputated the dead hand of regulation and sewed on Adam Smith's invisible hands, we would prosper in nearly textbook levels of perfect competition. Not since the Bolshevik Revolution has the discipline of economics embraced an ideology with such passion.</p>
        <p>At first, airline deregulation looked like a masterpiece of public policy. Airlines lowered fares, tapping the elasticities of demand and filling seats that otherwise would have flown empty, thereby enjoying record profitability. Air Florida and People Express emerged, to drive first prices, and then themselves, through the floor. But now all the major new airlines are dead, or nearly so.</p>
        <p>The implicit thesis of the theology of laissez-faire is that unconstrained human greed will produce a better society. Under the stars and stripes of the free market, corporate raiders were freed to devour healthy companies and suck them dry of capital, leaving them wounded, unable to produce a new product or compete better in a global marketplace.</p>
        <p>Savings and loan deregulation will cost every taxpayer $5,000, minimum. Local telephone rates have risen sharply. Yet free-market economists insist consumers save billions.</p>
        <p>Your editorial is not only misguided but also misleading. You ignore the prederegulation trend of declining fares and increased traffic. Yes, fuel and inflation-adjusted air fares are lower than in 1978. They fell every decade under regulation as well, and were falling at a faster rate before deregulation. Yes, more travelers are flying than ever before. That is also true every year since 1938.</p>
        <p>The world is rightly rejecting the socialist alternative. But the ravages of too free a market should be as manifest. Take for example the illicit sale of narcotics, sex and gambling, markets tenaciously driving toward freedom. Only one who has a theological libertarian passion for free markets would prefer the anarchy created by the total absence of government.
