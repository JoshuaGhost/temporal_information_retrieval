        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Autumn Investment" (Topics of The Times, Nov. 25), you state that gardeners have little else to spend time on now, other than planting bulbs, and "nothing much to cash in on except the chrysanthemums they put in last April."</p>
        <p>I protest! While late autumn is cleanup time and bulb-planting time before the ground freezes, there is much more to cash in on -- if that means to enjoy -- than spring-planted mums (perhaps better planted in May than chancy April). There's a host of fall bloomers -- asters, autumn crocus, dahlias, sedum and many more -- to delight the eye.</p>
        <p>The premise that gardeners must resign themselves to a barren, idle period until spring is belied by the fact that gardening goes on indoors as well as outdoors year round; an endlessly absorbing and pleasurable pastime. Potted plants in infinite variety enrich the home and lift the spirits with green and colorful foliage and with blossoms all winter long.</p>
        <p>For people who love to garden, or just grow things, there's a lot more to do at this time than merely moon about with autumn dreams of spring flowers. RUTH SHAW ERNST Scarsdale, N.Y., Nov. 26, 1991</p>
        <p>The writer is author of "The Movable Garden," about container planting.</p>
