        <p>AT last the question stands clear and pressing: is the Soviet Union to be or not to be?</p>
        <p>Ever since the coup, politicians at all levels have hemmed and hawed, toying with a "union of sovereign states" and a "common economic area" while declaring independence and pillaging the property of the old union, issuing bold declarations about free enterprise while clinging to the old structures.</p>
        <p>But last week time ran out. The central government ran flush out of money, Ukrainians made it utterly clear in a referendum that yes, they really meant to become independent, and President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian Republic signaled that he would not postpone fundamental economic reform while other republics dithered.</p>
        <p>And with these developments, the notion has begun to take hold that perhaps clinging to vestiges of the old union is really not so necessary, that it may even be best for the whole thing to collapse. As the old union lurches toward a final dismemberment, its impending death seems to lose its sting, and almost to raise new hope.</p>
        <p>Predictably, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is not among those who think so. After the Ukrainian vote, he went on national television to argue grimly and fervently that the collapse of the union would mean collapse of production, society, science, culture, everything.</p>
        <p>But the performance was more pathetic than frightening. His own shrunken administration is now surviving on scraps from Mr. Yeltsin's table, and a cruel suspicion lurks that his fervor derives in part from the recognition that his own job stands to become redundant. But there is also no doubt that Mr. Gorbachev himself, and a lot of others like him, truly believe that the only future lies in union.</p>
        <p>They point to the complex economic links that have formed over decades, the huge nuclear army scattered across all the republics, the millions of people who have moved outside their ethnic homelands, the vague borders that could trigger Yugoslavia-like conflicts.  The Greatest Fear</p>
        <p>There is also the massive military-industrial complex whose collapse would mean the dispersion of the finest in Soviet talent and technology -- and worse, whose disgruntled and pampered employees might yet take a stab at seizing power.</p>
        <p>Chaos: to many Soviets, among them Mr. Gorbachev, it is the greatest fear. Many in a nation that has only begun to enjoy a touch of security after civil war, famine, war, mass murder and repression still seem to prefer the humiliation of endless lines, empty shops and political inaction to the terrible unknown.</p>
        <p>And yet the months since the August coup have also demonstrated that chaos does not necessarily lie with disunion, that in fact the ponderous corpse of the old empire is potentially the greatest obstacle to improvement.</p>
        <p>As long as there was a central government, it seemed, the country remained seized by inertia, and the printing presses continued churning out more rubles to feed the beast, adding to a deficit that threatened to overwhelm any chance of restoring financial stability. "We should celebrate every time a Ukraine breaks off or a ministry goes broke," declared Pyotr Zrelov, general director of Dialogue, a private conglomerate that is involved in banking, computers and many other activities and is one of the more successful private enterprises in the Soviet Union. His argument is that trying to prop up the military-industrial complex, or exhausted ministries, or the old union Government, only delays what has to happen.</p>
        <p>The paradox, he said, is that Ukraine has to become truly independent if it is to join freely in any new association, which Mr. Zrelov is convinced will happen within a decade. By the same logic, a military factory has to be cut off from its habitual subsidies if it is ever to convert to something useful.</p>
        <p>What is different is that Mr. Zrelov is no longer among the few to think so. True, the economic situation has deteriorated terribly in the months since the coup. The ruble is plunging, Moscow is all but out of food, prices on the free market are soaring.</p>
        <p>And yet in these brief months, the nation has demonstrated a promising resourcefulness in coping with the torrent of crises and challenges, in filling the vacuum of the collapsed center.  Nuclear Anxiety</p>
        <p>The approach of real self-government in the republics seems to foster a greater sense of responsibility. Leaders of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia and Russia have separately demonstrated a comforting wisdom in their approach to international fears about the nuclear weapons on their soil.</p>
        <p>Faced with default on foreign debt, Mr. Yeltsin took the lead in accepting responsibility for the payments in exchange for a year's grace. Russia likewise moved in to support the bankrupt center, preventing an abrupt collapse but also chaining the vestigial government to Russian will.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, Mr. Yeltsin huddled with leaders of Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan -- but without Mr. Gorbachev -- to discuss new forms of cooperation. Independent businesses have proliferated as apparatchiks flee the dying ministries and businessmen take advantage of the loosened controls.</p>
        <p>Above all, as the fate of the union hangs in the balance, there is a sense that there is simply no feasible alternative.</p>
        <p>Gone are the days when the Kremlin could knock off a few billion rubles or sell a couple of tons of gold to keep some useless bomb factory cranking for a few more months.</p>
        <p>Gone are the days when Western nations, mesmerized by the forceful new leader in the Kremlin, would extend a few more billions in credits.</p>
        <p>Most important, gone are the days when old Communists could easily throw sticks in the wheels of reform. The major republics are now under leaders with genuine popular mandates -- President Yeltsin in Russia, Leonid M. Kravchuk in Ukraine, Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan -- who have no intention of letting old Bolsheviks rear up anew.</p>
        <p>The dangers lie elsewhere, and they are formidable indeed. The greatest is that the reforms proposed by the Russian government, which include letting prices rise and the ruble fall, will either fail or provoke powerful opposition.</p>
        <p>The respected Independent Gazette speculated that if they do, power could well pass to some form of "national patriotic" movement. This could range from the overtly fascistic followers of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky to the new patriotic-military line of the Russian vice president, Air Force General Aleksandr Rutskoi, who has openly broken with Mr. Yeltsin over the reforms.</p>
        <p>Perhaps even more frightening is that people might simply lose their remarkable patience, launching a wave of social unrest that the government would be powerless to quell. Gazing at the lengthening lines and the dropping temperatures, it is hard to imagine how the people would react to the even greater hardships inevitable at least in the first phase of the Russian reforms.</p>
        <p>Nothing in history seems to provide any formula, any hint of what lies ahead. Empires have declined and fallen before, to be sure, but never like this one. It is uncharted territory. Standing at a new crossroads, the suspense is tangible.</p>
