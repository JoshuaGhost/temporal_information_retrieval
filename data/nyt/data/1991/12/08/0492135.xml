        <p>IF Cinderella had lived in Westchester, chances are her coach would have turned into a pumpkin long before midnight. County residents who attempt to dine after 10 P.M. on weeknights often find their favorite restaurants closed or shutting their kitchens for the night. Those accustomed to Manhattan's late-night dining opportunities can be discouraged at settling for fast-food meals or takeout from an all-night supermarket.</p>
        <p>For those who missed the early train out of Grand Central and aren't looking forward to foraging among the forlorn contents of their refrigerators, or for those who want to socialize with colleagues from Open School Nights or community meetings, there</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>possibilities.</p>
        <p>Here is a selected list of restaurants offering a dinner or late-night food menu past 10 o'clock. Not all of them provide an Epicurean experience, but they do offer table service and freshly prepared meals. Be forewarned: although managers and maitre d'hotels vouched for their hours, it's best to phone to confirm them.</p>
        <p>One of the most reliable sources for home-style Italian food is the Pizza and Brew chain of family restaurants. The kitchen offers the full menu until 11 P.M. Patrons can choose from a variety of pizzas or pasta dishes starting at $6.95, with meat dishes like veal parmigiana starting at $10.45. There is also a wide selection of desserts.</p>
        <p>These restaurants are countywide: in Scarsdale at 851 Central Park Avenue (472-1032); in White Plains at 85 Knollwood Road (946-5211); in Rye Brook at 136 Ridge Street (937-2511); in Thornwood at 1060 Broadway (747-1505); in Bedford Hills at 747 North Bedford Road (666-9222), and in Croton-on-Hudson on South Riverside Avenue (271-6608).</p>
        <p>Another possibility for pizza is Pizzeria Uno at 4 Martine Avenue in White Plains (948-8191). Pizzas cost $3.95 to $10.95, depending on toppings. Other choices include chicken fajitas, lasagna and other pasta dishes, rib and chicken plates, burgers and other sandwiches, with most items costing $3.95 to $9.95.</p>
        <p>For Mexican food, Pancho's &amp; Gringo's at 666 Lexington Avenue (at Routes 172 and 128) in Mount Kisco (666-9173) has a dinner menu that includes fajitas, enchiladas and shrimp dishes. Prices are mostly around $10.</p>
        <p>For a late-night craving for tandoor-style chicken or shrimp, curries and biryani dishes, Malabar Hills, at 145 East Main Street in Elmsford (347-7890), offers a full menu through 11 o'clock. Diners can choose from Indian breads and appetizers as well as main courses, which cost $11 to $18.</p>
        <p>Another Indian restaurant whose kitchen remains open is Abhilash at 30 Division Street in New Rochelle (235-8390). There is a wide variety of vegetarian and curry dishes as well as seafood, fish and tandoor-style shrimp and lobster. Prices are $10.95 to $21.95.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, many of the restaurants that offer a dinner option after 10 P.M. are casual hangouts for residents and office workers. Oliver's at 15 South Broadway in White Plains (761-6111) features steaks, hamburgers and other sandwiches from $4.95 to $10.95.</p>
        <p>Cobblestone, on Anderson Hill Road in Purchase (253-9678), next door to the Purchase Fire Department, offers a variety of burgers, quiches and specialty sandwiches like grilled chicken breast. The menu also features appetizer finger foods like mozzarella sticks and chicken wings and desserts like cakes and pies. Burgers start at $3.50, with chicken dishes starting at $8.95.</p>
        <p>There is also Tumbledown's at 7 Pondfield Road in Bronxville (779-6699), which offers steak sandwiches, soups, buffalo wings, hamburgers and Cajun shrimp on its late-night menu. Prices range from $3.95 to $8.95.</p>
        <p>Those who enjoy late-night meals in a casual cozy setting can try Isabel's Cafe at 61 Main Street in Tarrytown (631-9819). Besides hamburgers and other sandwiches, there is also a wide variety of pasta, seafood, chicken and steak entrees, as well as stuffed potatoes. Prices are $4.95 for the burgers to $10.95 and up for the chicken and pasta.</p>
        <p>In a similarly relaxed style, the Rockwells chain of casual restaurants is a standby for reasonable meals. Besides the inevitable burgers, pasta and sandwiches, there is also fish, barbecued chicken and ribs and daily fish and pasta specials. Prices begin at $5.50 for burgers and chicken-breast sandwiches, with pastas starting at $9.95 and fish dishes starting at $10.95. There is also a selection of desserts.</p>
        <p>These restaurants are in Tuckahoe at 16 Depot Square (961-7744); in Bedford Hills at 728 Bedford Road (666-0099); in Greenburgh at 718 Central Avenue (725-8240) and in White Plains at 1205 Mamaroneck Avenue (761-6697).</p>
        <p>Another possibility is the Ragtime Cafe at 175 Main Street in White Plains (328-9411), but it is closed for dinner on Mondays. There is a selection of veal, chicken, seafood and steak entrees until 11 P.M., with prices from $13.95 to $17.95.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Craven's at 56 Pondfield Road in Bronxville (337-3940) features such dishes as steak, salmon, pork, seafood and chicken on a dinner menu that has prices ranging from $12 to $17.</p>
        <p>Treetops at the Holiday Inn at 125 Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers (476-4446) offers a fixed-price menu of $23.50 that includes appetizer, salad, main course, dessert and coffee, as well as an a la carte choice of fish, seafood, steak, chicken and pasta. There are also burgers and other sandwiches. Prices are $7.50 for lighter selections, $9.50 and up for dinner entrees.</p>
        <p>To indulge in more formal fare, there is Bayfield's at the Hudson River Inn and Conference Center at 321 North Highland Avenue in Ossining (762-5600). It offers such dishes as rack of lamb, linguine puttanesca and salmon and appetizers like escargots, shrimp and scallops and mozzarella and tomatoes. Prices are $12.95 to $18.95. Because this is a conference center, there is the possibility that the restaurant might not be open if there are no meetings scheduled. Be sure to call first.</p>
        <p>No listing of late-night eateries would be complete without diners. Two draw customers from around the county: Mont Parnasse at 824 Central Avenue in Scarsdale (723-1899) offers hamburgers, other sandwiches, pasta, seafood, chicken and other dishes. Prices start at about $2.95 for burgers, rising to $8.95 for chicken marsala and $9.95 for seafood. At the ElDorado at 55 Main Street in Elmsford (592-6197), patrons can choose anything from breakfast items like waffles, omelets and pancakes to hot sandwiches, steaks, pasta and hamburgers. Prices start at $3.25 for waffles, with most main dishes costing $8 to $15.</p>
