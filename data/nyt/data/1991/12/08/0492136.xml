        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a composer, I read the article "Run Into Any Mozarts Lately?"  [ Nov. 17 ]  with interest. Contrasting possibilities for composers of today with those of the 18th century makes an intriguing study. Yet all the composers cited as examples in the article are men, and this does not address a fascinating difference between our time and Mozart's.</p>
        <p>As the sampling in the article seems to show, women do not immediately spring to mind as composers even to today's knowledgeable male musicians. Among a particularly well-informed audience, the names of one or two women might be known. Fine artists though they are, these token women can hardly represent the mutiplicity of musical styles and temperaments of the thousands of women composing today.</p>
        <p>But in Mozart's time there were no women composers at all. None with real careers or reputations. No opportunities existed then for women to acquire the experience and training needed for development of the craft.</p>
        <p>For male composers, our time may seem one of career frustrations and small recognition. For women, building careers -- while even more arduous than for men -- has at least become possible, something inconceivable in Mozart's day. JOELLE WALLACH New York  TODAY'S COMPOSERS</p>
