Page A1  Ukrainian-Americans in New York celebrated.  A10  SOVIET CENTER FAILS TO HOLD</p>
        <p>News Analysis: The Soviet Union is now little more than a label of convenience while Russia, the Ukraine and their neighbors sort out their separate fates.  A1  HOSTAGE TO BE FREED, CAPTORS SAY</p>
        <p>Lebanese kidnappers said they would free an American captive, Joseph Cicippio, today, and there were indications that the two other remaining American hostages could be released by Sunday.  A1  ISRAEL AGAIN REBUFFS WASHINGTON</p>
        <p>Israeli leaders reaffirmed that they would not be in Washington on Wednesday for the resumption of Middle East peace talks.  A8  GERMANS SEEK EUROPEAN UNITY</p>
        <p>The European Community summit meeting will show Germany, long aggressively nationalistic, now more ready than any of its neighbors to surrender sovereignty to a strengthened community.  A3  PALESTINIAN GOAL: SELF-RULE SOON</p>
        <p>Palestinian strategy in the Middle East talks rests on the conviction that self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is attainable.  A8  A WORKING VISIT FROM MANDELA</p>
        <p>Nelson Mandela left for the United States on a visit less dramatic than the one he made in 1990, carrying a more complex message.  A5  U.S. POLICY ON ASYLUM DEBATED</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration's response to the recent flood of Haitian refugees has opened a new debate over whether Washington has a consistent policy on political asylum.

        <p>Though the number of black-white marriages has more than tripled since 1970, acceptance still comes slowly, if at all, for couples.  A1  SEEKING SAFETY IN THE DEEP</p>
        <p>Tackling conventional wisdom about the fragile ocean, scientists are pressing ahead with a plan to investigate the use of the deep sea floor for dumping sewage sludge.  A1  MERCHANTS ARE CAUTIOUS</p>
        <p>Although shoppers turned out in greater numbers than expected over the Thanksgiving weekend, merchants around the country expressed only tempered optimism about the holiday season.  A1  NEVER SAYING SORRY</p>
        <p>President Bush says neither he nor the United States will apologize to Japan for dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  A12  SAYING MUCH, DOING LITTLE</p>
        <p>The '92 campaign has begun, with everyone in Washington talking vigorously about improving the economy, but really looking at the opinion polls instead.  A13  A TOWN OF DREAD</p>
        <p>A dentist dead of AIDS; five of his patients infected with the virus; widespread fear in the community -- this is Stuart, Fla., in 1991.  A12  HELP FOR THE EXHAUSTED</p>

        <p>Subatomic particles called neutrinos are almost everywhere but remain largely a mystery. Now some researchers believe that they have discovered a key to the universe in the ghostly particles.  B7  EYES ON THE ROAD</p>
        <p>Two days after 17 people died in a multiple-vehicle accident in California, safety experts say the unpredictability of human reactions are as much a cause of traffic accidents in conditions of limited visibility as is the fog or dust itself.  A15  NEW VIEW OF CAPITOL</p>
