        <p>Spotlight on Kevin Maxwell</p>
        <p>After Robert Maxwell died, his son was questioned about what he knew of his father's wheeling and dealing. Now it is becoming clear that several suspect transactions took place after Robert Maxwell's death. Page D1. Under the Gun in Peru</p>
        <p>A decade of growing terrorism has led many Peruvian and foreign business executives to list security as their primary problem. For fear of attack, many executives live and work behind fortress walls. Page D1. Ruling the Rule Makers</p>
        <p>Behind the criticism of Dan Quayle's competitiveness council is the 200-year-old dispute of whether President or Congress controls Federal agencies. Page B11. Order in the White House</p>
        <p>As John Sununu takes his leave, Samuel Skinner has two goals: to define White House plans for the economy and to mesh policy decisions with the Bush campaign. Page B10. Twist in Noriega Trial</p>
        <p>A secret intelligence operation in which Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega aided American officials could boost the general's defense. Page A16. What Does 'Green' Mean?</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates are insisting that words like "recyclable" on product labels have meanings that normal people can understand. Page B1.  Arizona Governor to Be Sued</p>
        <p>Federal regulators say J. Fife Symington engaged in self-dealing and negligence as the director of a savings and loan that failed. Page D1.</p>
