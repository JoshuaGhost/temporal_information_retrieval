        <p>Investigators, prosecutors and social service agency officials say there are signs that money and property are being stolen, by trickery and coercion, from America's elderly at a disturbing rate and that a large portion of the crimes are committed not by professional criminals but by neighbors, health aides, household workers and family members.</p>
        <p>Financial exploitation of the elderly, they say, is likely to continue growing as the number of older Americans who are most vulnerable to it, the lonely and those in poor health, rises.

        <p>Investigators, prosecutors and social service agency officials say there are signs that money and property are being stolen, by trickery and coercion, from America's elderly at a disturbing rate and that a large portion of the crimes are committed not by professional criminals but by neighbors, health aides, household workers and family members.</p>
        <p>Financial exploitation of the elderly, they say, is likely to continue growing as the number of older Americans who are most vulnerable to it, the lonely and those in poor health, rises. The recession and drug abuse are cited by law enforcement officials as the major motivation behind the rise in such crimes.</p>
        <p>"There has been an alarming increase and I am afraid it is fast becoming the crime of the 1990's," said Joanne B. Marlatt, program administrator of adult protection services for Colorado. Parallels to Child Abuse</p>
        <p>Like child abuse, many crimes against the elderly are not reported because the victims are physically or mentally unable to summon help, according to interviews with dozens of police and agency officials in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Arizona, Colorado, California, Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>In addition, the experts say, many cases go unreported because of a reticence on the part of the victims to publicly accuse close relatives, much like the silence that often cloaks child abuse, leaving the elderly people ashamed as well as emotionally traumatized.</p>
        <p>And even when the abuser is not a family member, investigators say, victims may remain silent, terrified that others will suspect they are unable to care for themselves and conclude they belong in a nursing home.</p>
        <p>There are few statistics on the subject, said Dr. Karl Pillemer, assistant professor of human development and family studies at Cornell University and an authority on abuse of the elderly. And what information exists is widely distrusted by officials, who say they believe that more than 80 percent of such cases never come to light.</p>
        <p>"However, we do have compelling evidence there is a dramatic increase in the number of cases being reported and that conditions for the material exploitation of older Americans are expected to keep growing," said Dr. Pillemer, who is the author of "Helping Elderly Victims: The Relativity of Elder Abuse" (Columbia University Press, 1989).</p>
        <p>The majority of the nation's 31 million men and women who are 65 or older lead active and independent lives. But it stands to reason that when crimes against the infirm or ill among the elderly are committed by people they trust, it tends to make all in the age group feel less secure.</p>
        <p>In one such case, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a live-in housekeeper "controlled" an 85-year-old man and his blind, bed-ridden wife, 83, and took $500,000 of their cash and property before their children, who lived in another state, became suspicious and went to the police.</p>
        <p>In Manchester Township, N.J., a middle-aged nurse's aide confessed that personal money problems had driven her to steal nearly $14,000 over six months from the checking account of an elderly widow. "I can't say why I did this other than to say I was under a great deal of stress," the woman told the police.</p>
        <p>There are even cases of the old stealing from the older. In Longmont, Colo., this year, the police charged a 68-year-old man with illegally taking $67,000 from his 85-year-old mother's bank account while she was in the hospital with pneumonia.</p>
        <p>Adult children with alcohol or drug problems are among the most likely to be abusers. So are those who were neglected, or who perceive themselves as having been neglected, as children and who feel justified in settling old scores.</p>
        <p>"The crimes against some old people by their children and even grandchildren amount to nothing more than a mugging," said Frank Reilly, a retired New York City police officer who now works in Florida as an investigator of abuse of the elderly.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement and social agency investigators also say that some debt-ridden family members steal from their aging relatives what they rationalize "is rightfully theirs," fearing that their inheritence might be eaten up by medical or nursing bills. Abuse Out Family</p>
        <p>Another major source of abuse is people who are hired to provide care in the home. By using threats that they will leave, forcing the elderly person into a nursing home, or by driving a wedge between the elderly person and family members, the workers can quickly exert great influence in a household, drain assets and then disappear.</p>
        <p>It is common for helpers to be hired at low hourly pay, without background checks for criminal activity, and to be given access to an elderly person's checkbook to pay for household expenses, officials say. In-home care for the elderly by nonprofessionals is a rapidly growing industry almost free of regulation in most states, and laws are difficult to enforce even when they do exist.</p>
        <p>In a confidential survey in 1989 of older Canadians, 2.5 percent of those questioned said they had been financially abused by someone they knew, Dr. Pillemer said. That proportion, if applied to the United States, would translate into some 750,000 victims.</p>
        <p>But he noted that crime rates typically run much higher in the United States, so the figure should be seen as an estimate of the lowest possible number of cases in this country. He also said it was significant that only one of 25 people in the survey said they had reported the abuse to the police.</p>
        <p>As the ranks of the enfeebled old swell, aided by medical advances that extend life, the problem of financial abuse is likely to grow.  Large Nest Eggs</p>
        <p>In the last few decades, having the financial means to live independently has become a hallmark of older Americans, millions of whom have uprooted themselves from families and familiar communities since the 1950's to move to retirement havens in Florida, Arizona and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Increasing numbers of these elderly people have substantial bank and investment accounts, supplemented by benefits from Social Security and private pension plans. Many have reaped large profits, in some cases in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, from homes sold during the real estate boom of the last two decades. Those who slip into mental impairment leave such nest eggs easy prey to financial abuse.</p>
        <p>Even less secure are people of meager means who live alone behind bolted doors in big cities.</p>
        <p>Every metropolitan area has many cases like that of a 79-year-old widow in New York City who was made a virtual prisoner inside her home by a grandson and his girlfriend, both crack addicts, who took her Social Security checks as soon as they arrived.</p>
        <p>Rose Herschberg, acting director of the elderly crime victims resource center of the New York City Department of Aging, said the best defense against abuse of the elderly is to educate potential victims and people who are likely to be in a position to help them, including the police, hospital workers and banks, on how to identify and address the threat.</p>
        <p>Often, the victims are women living alone, a consequence of the longer lives among American women compared to men. Married women of middle age, on average, will become widowed before turning 70 and will die 15 years later; fewer than 1 of 10 will remarry. The United States Census Bureau has estimated that by 1995, 60 percent of women 75 and older will be living alone.</p>
        <p>Loneliness among the elderly population and the fear of becoming a burden on families are thoughts never far from the minds of those who live alone. "Even if they know a care-provider, like a housekeeper or an adult child, is stealing their money, they won't report it because they are completely dependent, psychologically and physically, on that individual," said Fran Shaw, a paralegal investigator for the Broward County state attorney's office in Florida.</p>
        <p>Near Asbury Park, N.J., the authorities recently were told that a man was stealing money from his mother, a woman in her 70's who lived alone and who was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>"We investigated and found he had taken more than $60,000 from her," said Steven Cerretani, director of protective services for the elderly in Monmouth County. "But she wouldn't press charges because her son was her only contact with the outside world. She told us she was so lonely she'd pay the devil to visit her." Who Reports Abuse</p>
        <p>When a case of financial abuse is reported, the source of the information is likely to be someone other than the victim: a police officer or ambulance attendant who responds to a call from the victim's residence, a bank teller who notices unusual cash withdrawals from a victim's account, a neighbor who observes strangers at a victim's home, or family members who discover that someone has been looting an elderly person's assets.</p>
        <p>A sampling of recent police cases shows the variety of crimes against the elderly.</p>
        <p>Near Sacramento, Calif., a 79-year-old widow described by an investigator as "sweet and charming, with some dementia and memory loss" was befriended by a younger man, who ran errands for her. Soon, he had become her "financial adviser" and talked her into giving him power of attorney over her bank accounts and stock. By the time a relative became suspicious, the man had looted the accounts of more than $150,000 and fled with jewelry and other property valued at $80,000.</p>
        <p>A 56-year-old Pompano Beach, Fla., man who was the legal guardian for his infirm mother, was accused of pocketing $161,000 he withdrew from her bank account. Kent Neal, who heads the economic crimes unit of the Broward County prosecutor's office, said the man had used the money for a variety of expenses, including rust-proofing his car and paying traffic fines. "But at the same time he wouldn't allow doctors to replace his mother's heart pacemaker," he said. Many Are Hurt</p>
        <p>The mentally incapacitated are not the only ones who get hurt.</p>
        <p>In Sun City, Ariz., Ellen Lewis's eyesight was failing. Otherwise the 74-year-old widow was alert and energetic. Her one weakness, she recalled ruefully, was trust.</p>
        <p>After her husband's death, Mrs. Lewis needed someone to drive her on errands and to do yard work. Through friends she hired "a bright clean-cut young man" and trusted him to such a degree that after a while she began routinely signing blank checks to be used by him for her household bills.</p>
        <p>Instead, the 23-year-old man wrote four-figure sums payable to himself in a deception that was not caught for months. He confessed to the police that he had stolen thousands of dollars and he agreed to make restitution, but the episode undermined Mrs. Lewis's confidence about living alone.</p>
        <p>In Swampscott, Mass., north of Boston, Emma Marquis also trusted "a nice young man," and it cost her $180,000, her life savings.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Marquis, a widow, was shopping for a safe investment in 1983 when she was introduced to a Salem business leader and financial consultant. "If I had had a son, I would want one like him," Mrs. Marquis, now 79, said in a telephone interview. "He was so handsome and had a silver-tongue personality. Everything he said, you trusted."</p>
        <p>Through the consultant, an annuity account was opened in her name with a $60,000 check she wrote. Without her knowledge, however, the man closed the account within days by forging Mrs. Marquis's name and he cashed the reimbursement check issued by the insurance company. A few years later, Mrs. Marquis gave him another $120,000 to deposit in the account.</p>
        <p>When the consultant died last year at age 47, there were immediate rumors he had bilked dozens of clients. Mrs. Marquis learned that there was no annuity fund in her name.</p>
        <p>Her life savings wiped out, Mrs. Marquis said she faces the future with dread. Her children send her monthly checks, "but I don't like taking things from them," she said. "I don't want to be a burden."</p>
