        <p>Mr. Challender went to Europe in 1968 and spent 12 years studying conducting in Hamburg and Vienna. In Switzerland, he was resident conductor at the Municipal Theater in Lucerne and conducted at opera houses in Basel and Zurich before returning to Australia in 1980.</p>
        <p>Mr. Challender conducted all the major Australian symphony, chamber and opera orchestras in recent years. He conducted Dame Joan Sutherland in "Lucia di Lammermoor" for the Netherlands Opera in 1982 and three years later made his American debut conducting "Eugene Onegin" at the San Diego Opera.</p>
        <p>In 1987, he made his British debut with the Royal Philharmonic, BBC Scottish and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestras. He toured the United States with the Sydney Symphony in 1988, conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Hong Kong in 1989 and in 1990 conducted four concerts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>
