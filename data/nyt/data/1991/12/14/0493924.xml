        <p>Jeff Hostetler is healing, but too slowly for his own comfort. "I feel better," he said, "but I can't step it up."</p>
        <p>Hostetler, the Giants' starting quarterback, was injured three weeks ago in the team's 21-14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He suffered fractures to three transverse processes, the winglike attachments to the vertebrae in his back. The injury ended his season.</p>
        <p>"There's been improvement," he said. "The sharp pain is gone. Now it's just a nagging pain. When I take a long left step, I feel it. When I lift my legs, I feel it. The doctor told me everything is attached to those bones."</p>
        <p>Hostetler has been spending 20 to 30 minutes a day in a hotel swimming pool. He rides a stationary bicycle in Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>"They never said what the next step will be," he said. "The fact that it's three broken bones complicates it."</p>
        <p>"When does it hurt?" Hostetler was asked.</p>
        <p>"When doesn't it?" he said. Simms Has Felt Better, Too</p>
        <p>Phil Simms took part in the Giants' practice Friday. It was the first time this week that he practiced and he remained probable for Sunday's game against the Redskins in Washington.</p>
        <p>Simms became the starting quarterback again when Hostetler was injured. Simms bruised his right shoulder last Sunday when Seth Joyner sacked him and fell on him in the Giants' 19-14 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Simms did not take part in practice Wednesday and threw on the sidelines Thursday.</p>
        <p>On Friday, in the rain, Simms took most of the offensive work and Matt Cavanaugh took the rest. Simms will throw some during Saturday's walk-through practice. Meanwhile, the swelling in the shoulder has gone down. Williams Waits. And Waits.</p>
        <p>In 1989, the Giants drafted Brian Williams, a Minnesota guard, on the first round and projected him as their next center. For three seasons, he has been a backup guard and center. He seldom plays.</p>
        <p>Many people expected Williams to beat out Bart Oates in last summer's training camp and become the starting center. But Williams missed two preseason games because of a sprained knee, and Oates, who will become 33 years old Monday, has played well all year.</p>
        <p>"When Brian Williams starts is not up to him," Coach Ray Handley said. "He can play at his best and not unseat a veteran.</p>
        <p>"We're ready for Brian to take the job at center. Whether he's capable of doing that, I don't know. Whether he does may not be a comment on him, but on Bart Oates, who is one of the better pass blockers in the league. I'm not looking to make a change."</p>
        <p>Still, Handley said he had confidence in Williams.</p>
        <p>"He has made good strides," the coach said. "If something happened to Bart, Brian would step in and probably be an outstanding performer."</p>
        <p>Oates, a lawyer in the off season, expects to play next year. Williams said that made no difference to him.</p>
        <p>"I'm disappointed I'm not playing," Williams said. "I will start next year, whatever it takes. I know in my heart I'll start." It's a Mystery to Marshall</p>
        <p>The Giants' disappointing season has baffled Leonard Marshall, their defensive end.</p>
        <p>"In 1987, the year after we won the Super Bowl, we were a good football team, but we had a bad season," he said. "We knew what we did wrong. But this year, we won the Super Bowl, then had a bad season, and we don't have a clue what went wrong.</p>
        <p>"What happened in 1987 was that guys were doing their own thing. They were not used to success. This year, this team has been used to success, and we're still not winning."  FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK</p>
