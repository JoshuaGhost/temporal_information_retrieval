        <p>Dusk settled over a windswept South Bronx street as several teen-agers chopped an agricultural product that they will later stash into bags. The next day these same youths would deliver the goods to chic addresses on the East Side and in Greenwich Village, where their customers would rip open the bags, burn their contents and savor the sweet-smelling smoke.</p>
        <p>The bags are burlap, not glassine, and the chopping is done with axes, not razors.</p>
        <p>These youths deal in firewood.</p>
        <p>At Hunts Point Farms, several dozen youths run their own show, chopping, hawking and delivering firewood salvaged from a lot where suburban tree services used to dump their castoffs in the dead of night. Their efforts at applied entrepreneurship have helped them gain a measure of self-respect and confidence in a community where outsiders assume that youthful entrepreneurs are found only on street corners.</p>
        <p>"Everybody here has faith in himself and puts his best into it," said Andre Bell, 16 years old. "Teamwork makes a difference and if you try, you can succeed."</p>
        <p>The firewood business has its roots in a fire of a more sinister kind, when a building used by crack dealers on Bryant Avenue was gutted several years ago.</p>
        <p>The structure was razed, and the lot sat empty until members of a local youth group cleared the land, leveled the soil and turned it into a football field, said Paul Lipson, a youth worker at the nearby Seneca Neighborhood Center, which runs the farm along with the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club. But hauling companies and tree services regularly broke into the field at night and dumped their haul.</p>
        <p>"The South Bronx was a dumping ground and so much was cast away," Mr. Lipson said. "You have to turn it into something lucrative and hopeful."</p>
        <p>That happened one evening three years ago when Ralphie Acevedo, an 18-year-old who built the field, caught one of the illegal dumpers in the act. Embarrassed, the culprit made him an offer -- he would dump only good hardwood that the youths could then sell for firewood.</p>
        <p>"It sounded crazy at first, but you have to give everything a shot," Ralphie said the other day as he stood atop a tree stump while around him four youths sweated and huffed as they whacked at clumps of timber. "Everybody else liked it so I went with the flow."</p>
        <p>With help from Mr. Lipson, the youths devised a marketing plan, designed fliers and took to the streets of Manhattan's town-house-lined blocks to hawk firewood, offering free delivery. Their efforts inspired Jerry Cuevas, who lived next door to the lot, to call every tree service he could find in the Bronx and Westchester, and soon the field was covered in stumps, limbs and wood chips.</p>
        <p>Foundation grants pay their salaries, and the proceeds from the sales are used partly as commissions and partly to finance a college scholarship. The latter has been an elusive goal -- although all the participants graduate from high school, few go on to college because of limited resources.</p>
        <p>Early prospects were incredulous when the youths walked into brownstone hallways and restaurants with their fliers. "No one believed us," Ralphie said.  "They thought we were going to rip them off."</p>
        <p>Over time, and after countless explanations that the firewood business was giving youths jobs, the business grew.</p>
        <p>Juanito Rivera, a 14-year-old who swings a mean ax, said he would like to live in a house like the ones where he delivers firewood each weekend.</p>
        <p>"When it gets cold and you don't have a heater, all you got to do is throw some wood in the fireplace and there goes your steam right there," he said.</p>
        <p>The budding business people at the Seneca Center also sell herbs grown in a community garden, postcards and T shirts featuring Bronx street scenes and deliver Christmas trees each year for vendors in Union Square.</p>
        <p>"If we have 15-year-old kids running crack spots, there's no reason we can't have them running a legitimate business," Mr. Lipson said.</p>
        <p>Until he chanced upon a Hunts Point Farms flier, Walter Neal bought his firewood at Balducci's, around the corner from his Greenwich Village apartment.  "I think these kids are great," Mr. Neal said when they delivered his wood. "They're all trustworthy."</p>
        <p>Their delivery finished, the youths piled into Mr. Lipson's van and drove away, passing a truck that idled outside Balducci's, its flatbed covered with hundreds of small logs wrapped in yellow plastic. Spotting the competition, a few of the youths smirked.</p>
        <p>"They're no comp," boasted Nakia Williams. "If they were, people wouldn't be buying from us. Ain't no comp."</p>
