        <p>The failure of New York City's Environmental Protection Department to approve contracts for $600 million in badly needed repair work deals the city a further blow. Mayor David Dinkins has wisely called for closer supervision of the department, and the Environmental Commissioner, Albert Appleton, has belatedly made some management changes.  Nonetheless, the $600 million gaffe raises serious questions about Mr. Appleton's stewardship.</p>
        <p>The unlet contracts were designed to upgrade water mains and sewers. With mains bursting all around town, the repairs were critical. The city authorized $1.34 billion for the last fiscal year; the department spent only $711 million.</p>
        <p>As Calvin Sims reported in The Times, the delay hurts. The repair work could have created jobs. It would have benefited from depressed construction costs. And it would have headed off expensive emergency repairs.</p>
        <p>As excuses, Mr. Appleton cites cuts in street crews, preoccupation with moving his office, a blizzard of new paperwork and a repair plan that was too ambitious. None of that explains away a $600 million mistake.</p>
        <p>More likely, the department is not getting adequate management. Mr. Appleton is a dedicated environmentalist who has taken the lead in purchasing watershed land upstate to insure a continuing source of good water for the city and is working hard to save the Staten Island wetlands.</p>
        <p>But his department is primarily a construction and utility agency, responsible for maintaining New York City's aging water and sewer system. Managing such projects has not been Mr. Appleton's strength. He hasn't dealt with the stench from Harlem's North River sewage treatment plant. He could be more aggressive in cleaning up hazardous waste sites and in responding to the water shortage.</p>
        <p>If the Commissioner does not shift his own focus toward management, Mayor Dinkins would do well to consider using Mr. Appleton's energy elsewhere in his administration.</p>
