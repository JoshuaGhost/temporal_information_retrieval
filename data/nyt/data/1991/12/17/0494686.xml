        <p>Sandoz Ltd., the big Swiss drug and chemical company, announced yesterday that it had agreed to pay $391.8 million for 60 percent of Systemix, a genetics science company started by Stanford University researchers.</p>
        <p>The deal valued the four-year-old company at about $650 million. Systemix's stock rose $19.75 a share yesterday to close at $53 in over-the-counter trading.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Sandoz Ltd., the big Swiss drug and chemical company, announced yesterday that it had agreed to pay $391.8 million for 60 percent of Systemix, a genetics science company started by Stanford University researchers.</p>
        <p>The deal valued the four-year-old company at about $650 million. Systemix's stock rose $19.75 a share yesterday to close at $53 in over-the-counter trading.</p>
        <p>The announcement came after the close of the Swiss stock market, but Sandoz's American depository receipts closed at $34 a share, down 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading. Faster Development Expected</p>
        <p>Dr. Linda Sonntag, chief executive of Systemix, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said the company planned to accelerate development of a patented process for separating blood stem cells from bone marrow, a technique it hoped could be used in treating certain types of cancer patients.</p>
        <p>Stem cells in the bone marrow are believed to give rise to all the circulating blood cells in the immune and blood systems.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sonntag said the process, which received a patent five weeks ago, would be tested in humans for the first time in a few months at Stanford, where it would be tried on cancer patients weakened by heavy doses of chemotherapy or radiation treatment. The purpose is to purify stem cells to eliminate traces of the disease.</p>
        <p>"This takes us one step beyond traditional biotechnology," said Dr. Max Link, chief executive of the Sandoz Pharma Ltd., the Zurich-based company's pharmaceutical unit. Dr. Sonntag said the purified stem cells offered "an ideal vehicle" for treating genetic disorders.</p>
        <p>Dr. Link said Sandoz hoped to be ready to market the cancer treatment program by 1994. Both Dr. Link and Dr. Sonntag said that under current Federal regulations the use of the stem cells in such a process did not require Food and Drug Administration approval. F.D.A. approval for drugs can take years.</p>
        <p>They said the process would also be tested for applications in treating AIDS patients and to try to prevent the rejection of animal organs in transplants to humans.</p>
        <p>The process was developed by a group headed by Dr. Irving Weissman, a professor of pathology and cancer biology at Stanford. He founded Systemix with Dr. J. Michael McCune, a former Stanford colleague, and Eli S. Jacobs, a New York venture capitalist.  Profitability Target: 1994</p>
        <p>Dr. Sonntag said Systemix planned to add 60 people to its 90 employees by the end of the year. She said that if the blood marrow tests succeeded, the stem cell technology could bring the company its first profits in 1994.</p>
        <p>She said the second product would use similar technology to purify megakaryocyte precursers, a type of cell in the bone marrow that gives rise to platelets essential in blood clotting. Systemix said it had been able to use the purification process in producing platelets in the laboratory.</p>
        <p>The company said there were three million platelet transfusions a year in the United States.</p>
        <p>Sandoz said it had agreed to make a tender offer for four million shares of Systemix common stock on a fully diluted basis at $70 a share, for about $280 million in cash. Sandoz will also buy 1.98 million newly issued shares for $111 million, or $56 a share.</p>
        <p>The agreement gives Sandoz control of the Systemix board of directors and permits Sandoz to buy the entire company after three years, if the independent directors approve. If not, Sandoz agreed not to increase its holding above 60 percent for the first seven years, and not to go above 75 percent for the three years after that. Went Public in August</p>
        <p>Systemix, which became a publicly owned company in August, at $18 a share, was advised in the deal by S. G. Warburg &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Dr. Link said Systemix scientists would work on Sandoz-supported projects involving "transplantation tolerance" cancer and AIDS research at Genetic Therapy Inc., a Gaithersburg, Md., company in which Sandoz has a minority interest. Systemix scientists will also work with Dr. Eli Gilboa at Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute and Prof. Fritz Bach at Columbia University, Dr. Link said.</p>
        <p>Sandoz, which conducts one-third of its business in the United States, reported $625 million in profits last year on sales of $8.9 billion.</p>
