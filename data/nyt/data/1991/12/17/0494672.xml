        <p>America's cities have more hungry and homeless people than they can feed and house, and the situation is getting worse, the United States Conference of Mayors said today.</p>
        <p>In a report on a survey of 28 cities, the conference also said that officials in nearly half of those cities reported evidence of a public backlash against homeless people.</p>
        <p>The report said demand for emergency food increased 22 percent in 1990 and 26 percent in 1991. Demand for emergency shelter grew 24 percent last year and 13 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Officials in all cities predicted continued growth in demand in 1992.</p>
        <p>It said that on the average 17 percent of the food needs and 15 percent of the shelter needs were believed to have gone unmet.</p>
        <p>The increases in requests for food assistance ranged from 132 percent in Norfolk, Va., to 10 percent or less in Alexandria, Va., Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, St. Paul, San Antonio, San Diego and Trenton.</p>
        <p>Half the cities said emergency food sites were unable to provide adequate quantities of food.</p>
