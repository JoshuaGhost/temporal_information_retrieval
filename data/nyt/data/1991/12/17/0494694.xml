        <p>Retreating from a long-held stance, New York City's largest municipal labor union has agreed to consider unpaid furloughs to avert the layoffs this winter of about 600 city highway workers, city officials said.</p>
        <p>The layoffs were scheduled for yesterday, but they have been delayed until Dec. 29 while negotiations continue between the city and District Council 37 of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, James F. Hanley, the city's Commissioner of Labor Relations, said.</p>

        <p>Retreating from a long-held stance, New York City's largest municipal labor union has agreed to consider unpaid furloughs to avert the layoffs this winter of about 600 city highway workers, city officials said.</p>
        <p>The layoffs were scheduled for yesterday, but they have been delayed until Dec. 29 while negotiations continue between the city and District Council 37 of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, James F. Hanley, the city's Commissioner of Labor Relations, said.</p>
        <p>The Dinkins adminstration has long favored furloughs over layoffs. But District Council 37 has consistently opposed such proposals, fearing they would open the door to employing workers seasonally while still leaving them vulnerable to future layoffs.</p>
        <p>A District Council 37 spokeswoman, Janet Dewart, maintained yesterday that the union would continue to resist furloughs in other city departments. "This is related only to the Department of Transportation," she said.  A Seasonal Alternative</p>
        <p>But City Hall officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity said that if the 118,000-member District Council 37 agreed to furloughs for highway workers, it could lend weight to city efforts to save money by employing workers seasonally in the Parks and Sanitation Departments.</p>
        <p>In the Parks Department, management and District 37 have been trying to work out an agreement under which park workers would be furloughed for three months during the winter but would collect three-quarters pay for the entire year. The alternative, city officials said, would be 369 permanent layoffs in late December.</p>
        <p>"If they work it out, it would certainly help our negotiations," one Parks Department official said of the talks with highway workers. "We think it's a good sign."</p>
        <p>One high-ranking aide to Mayor David N. Dinkins said an agreement on furloughs with the highway repair workers would be an "incremental but important step" toward permanently using seasonal workers for some city jobs. The negotiations on furloughs were described yesterday in The Daily News.</p>
        <p>In the final budget passed last summer, about 500 highway repairers, cement masons, streamroller drivers and other laborers who work on the roads were scheduled to be laid off this week for three months to save $2.4 million in the Transportation Department budget, Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the department, said. An understanding existed between management and labor that most of the workers would be rehired in the spring with the aid of state highway funds.</p>
        <p>But two weeks ago union negotiators reversed their position and agreed to listen to furlough proposals, Commissioner Hanley said. On Friday, the city put off the layoffs for two weeks.</p>
        <p>Since then, labor leaders and the city have been haggling over various proposals. The unions intially said they would accept two-week furloughs for all highway and bridge workers, city officials said. The city responded that nothing short of five-week furloughs for at least 731 highway workers would save the $2.4 million.</p>
        <p>Another proposal on the table would stretch out the furloughs with shortened workweeks through the winter rather than giving workers several weeks off at once, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley said the city must notify workers on Monday if it intends to lay them off on Dec. 29. The two sides are scheduled to meet again today, he said. "We're still taking a look at it," he added. "Nothing has really jelled yet."</p>
