        <p>Robert C. O'Brien, an expert in the financing of corporate acquisitions, is leaving Bankers Trust to accept a similar job at Manufacturers Hanover in mid-June, he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>At the Bankers Trust Company, Mr. O'Brien was part of a seven-member management committee overseeing global corporate finance. (He is not among the dozens of corporate finance specialists Bankers Trust has cut from its staff recently.) At Manufacturers Hanover, Mr. O'Brien, 47, will be a managing director in charge of acquisition finance, as well as other corporate lending business with energy and media companies, where he has extensive contacts.</p>
        <p>Mark Solow, who heads the global banking group at Manufacturers Hanover, said, "I've been competing head to head with Bob for at least six years now, and he clearly is one of the best bankers in the marketplace today." Mr. Solow added that Mr. O'Brien "is one of those rare guys who has a very strong following among businesses, as well as experience as an administrator."</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien said his primary role had been as "an outside man" working with large corporate customers to arrange bank loans and other financing. "But I've also been on the management committee, a strategic planner and delegated responsibility to younger people." Early in his career, he was head of Bankers Trust's retail banking, which it has since eliminated, as well as chief administrator for the bank's securities trading.</p>
        <p>Both Manufacturers Hanover and Bankers Trust were among the handful of leading banks in advising and lending for corporate takeovers, during the 1980's, and both have been forced to cut back their staff in that area as business has slowed the past two years. But Mr. Solow and Mr. O'Brien agreed that the remaining opportunities could be a good business.</p>
        <p>"The restructuring of corporate balance sheets continues nationally and globally," Mr. O'Brien said, "and there are a lot of deals done in the 1980's that require fixing." With bankers unable to lend all that their corporate clients would like and the "junk bond" market less vibrant than in the 1980's, he said, "the challenge for banks is to find the pools of capital that exist" and bring them to clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien graduated from Wagner College in 1966 and joined Bankers Trust in 1969 after serving in the Army, where he was a first lieutenant and infantry platoon leader in Vietnam. While at Bankers Trust, he attended the Graduate School of Financial Management at Williams College in 1978.</p>
        <p>He lives in Rockville Centre, L.I., with his wife, Patricia, and three daughters.</p>
