        <p>The bankers' adage "know your customer" is taking on new meaning in the credit card business, as banks increasingly rely on computers to guide their relationships with millions of customers they will never meet.</p>
        <p>Using statistical measures, or scores, for each customer, banks are learning how to avoid bad risks when soliciting millions of new accounts, provide better service to existing accounts and collect more on delinquent loans.</p>
        <p>No longer relying just on information provided on applications about income, employment history and money in savings accounts, banks now compile a score for each customer as they use the card. Robert D. Dutton, senior vice president at First Data Resources Inc., a credit card processing company, notes that there are 48 different characteristics by which a credit card account is measured.</p>
        <p>Very Profitable Business</p>
        <p>These include the extent to which monthly payments are for the full amount owned, the mimimum payment or some in-between amount; promptness of payment; whether the card is used for purchases or cash advances, and frequency of use. Some banks are now experimenting with scores that consider the size of purchases and the kinds of merchants where the card is used, Mr. Dutton said.</p>
        <p>The computer's ability to make sense of the myriad bits of customer data quickly and cheaply is a key reason for the extraordinary profitability of the credit card business. At Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of credit cards with more than 22 million accounts, specialized credit card banks in South Dakota and Nevada earned more than $600 million in 1990 (as a whole, Citicorp earned only $458 million because of losses in other parts of its business).</p>
        <p>Even when banks are not burdened with unusually heavy losses from their traditional lending, credit cards are three times as profitable as the rest of their business.</p>
        <p>"When you deal with millions of accounts, the computer allows consistent judgments that are just not possible if each account was analyzed by a person," said Thomas C. Lynch, head of the credit card business at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "The more experience and the more customers you have, the better you get at interpreting the data to identify which customers are most likely to become a credit problem or which are most likely to be interested in a new product."  Appeal to Smaller Banks</p>
        <p>The use of behavior scores is not limited to large banks. Small and medium-sized banks can buy models of what they would like their ideal customer's credit record to look like from companies including American Management Systems of Arlington, Va.; Fair, Isaac &amp; Company, San Rafael, Calif., and Management Decision Systems in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Credit Card Management magazine reported that more than 51 percent of the country's more than 200 million credit card accounts were evaluated by some kind of behavior score by mid-1990, compared with only 14 percent a year earlier. With that increased use, the price of a behavior score has fallen to less than 10 cents a name.</p>
        <p>"In the past, bankers treated their card customers like a portfolio to be managed," said Robert Heller, president of Visa U.S.A. But now, using behavior scores, "they are focusing more and more on individual account management," he said.</p>
        <p>The incentive to scrutinize credit card accounts has become greater as delinquencies and defaults have increased during the recession.  Reducing the Bad Accounts</p>
        <p>Peter F. DiGiammarino, a vice president at American Management Systems, said scoring of new applications could cut the number of bad accounts considerably and at the same time allow banks to approve a greater percentage of new applicants. For existing accounts, he said, scores for each customer can reduce delinquencies by 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Faced with rising losses and delinquencies, bankers have begun using credit bureau reports as a cross reference to spot new or existing customers who might be in financial trouble, but have tried to conceal it from their credit card bank by keeping their payments current. A recent study by Visa U.S.A. found that 70 percent of consumers filing for bankruptcy were having considerable difficulties paying their debts in the two years before they declared themselves bankrupt, but survived by borrowing on their credit cards.</p>
        <p>Behavior scores can improve customer service by helping banks quickly decide whether to approve a purchase that would put a customer over the credit line, or to grant their best customers increases in credit lines before they are needed.</p>
        <p>James Bailey, the head of the credit card business at Citicorp, noted that properly developed scores, which recognize regional differences in incomes and demographics, "help us approve more people and extend more credit than if we used a single score for the entire country."  Value of Home Ownership</p>
        <p>Analysts noted, for example, that in New York City home ownership might be a more important indicator of credit quality than in Kansas, where home ownership is the norm. Job turnover tends to be more rapid in Washington than in other parts of the country, meaning that behavior scores need to be adjusted.</p>
        <p>Eventually, bankers say, as competition heats up, fees and interest rates on cards may be fine-tuned to each customer, with discounts to the most valued customers.</p>
        <p>That practice is widespread in business lending but not in credit cards. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and Chase Manhattan, for example, increased interest rates for their least-profitable card customers in 1989, while maintaining their lower rates for their best customers.</p>
        <p>Because computers allow scores to be frequently updated, bankers are coming to rely on the scores as a low-cost way of making many day-to-day decisions. Allowing a customer to make a purchase that puts his debt above the credit limit can be done quickly and consistently, bankers say. When planning mail solicitations for products like insurance or brokerage accounts, bankers consult their credit card records to identify the most likely customers.  Decisions on Delinquencies</p>
        <p>And when loans become delinquent, bankers rely on behavior scores to decide which accounts should receive the most intensive collection efforts.</p>
        <p>"Some delinquent accounts are so low-risk that you are better off ignoring them for a while and concentrating your efforts on other accounts," Mr. Lynch of Chase Manhattan said. "You save money on postage, you save staff time and you avoid offending a customer who might get upset at a demand for payment."</p>
        <p>The Bank of America last year began using a behavior-scoring system developed by American Management Systems for delinquent installment loan accounts. It expects the system to reduce its collection costs by $2 million a year.</p>
        <p>The banks' increased reliance on behavior scores was illustrated last year when the First National Bank of Chicago reviewed its accounts in nine economically depressed states in New England and the mid-Atlantic region. Using the same credit standards as in the past but reviewing the accounts sooner than normal, it canceled 7,800 accounts and cut the credit lines of another 1,200 accounts by $4.5 million -- including some customers who were current on their credit card payments but who showed other signs of being risky accounts.  Reviews Were Accelerated</p>
        <p>Scott P. Marks, head of First Chicago's card business, told the House Banking Committee at a recent hearing that the company would have canceled or cut back the accounts under the normal review it conducts a year after accounts are opened or every two years thereafter.</p>
        <p>But the reviews were accelerated, he said, because bankruptcy filings among its customers in New England increased 77 percent in the first nine months of 1990 from 1989 levels. In New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, personal bankruptcies among First Chicago's customers rose 39 percent, or more than twice the 15 percent increase among all consumers nationwide.</p>
        <p>But there are risks of monitoring accounts too closely.</p>
        <p>Thomas E. Roach, a Brooklyn distributor of book publishing paper, canceled his American Express membership earlier this year when the company asked too many questions after his purchase of a $5,000 computer, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach said he was dismayed when American Express asked his bank if money was available and was upset when the use of the card was blocked, without asking what other funds he might have available, before he had been presented with his monthly bill.  Unusual Account Activity</p>
        <p>American Express said watching for unusual account activity was one of the ways it reduced fraudulent use of its cards. The definition of "unusual," of course, depends on the past activity in an account.</p>
        <p>As behavior scoring becomes more sophisticated, it is evolving into a field that bankers call "psychographics," in which the collection of consumer data can do more than just help the bank avoid losses. Some banks, including Chase Manhattan, have learned enough about some consumers to sell merchants lists of customers whose incomes and card use suggests that they would be receptive to special advertising.</p>
        <p>Some bankers look ahead to a time when merchants will itemize purchases on the card slip in exchange for a reduction in the bank fee, and banks will have better knowledge of their customers' buying habits.</p>
        <p>"Without question, as banks collect more information and make more use of it, privacy questions are going to arise," said Richard Fischer, a lawyer at Morrison &amp; Foerster in Washington. He said he expected the debate about who owns information about shopping habits would eventually lead to a new laws.</p>
