        <p>Ethiopian rebels captured the operational base and headquarters of the air force today, destroying the Government's main line of defense for the capital, Government officials said.</p>
        <p>Concerned by the steady rebel advance on Addis Ababa, senior American diplomats led by Herman J. Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, made contact with the rebels in London tonight and urged them to halt their offensive to give peace talks a chance to forge a transitional coalition government, a Western diplomat here said.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the warring Ethiopian factions and the American delegation have gathered in London for the peace conference, which is to open formally on Tuesday but is to be preceded by informal meetings on Monday.  Famine Is Feared</p>
        <p>The rebels have previously said they would hold off attacking the capital unless the peace conference failed. But today's advances heightened concern among diplomats and Government officials here that the guerrillas might seek an absolute military victory, leading to a bloodbath in the capital and the prospect of famine in Ethiopia as international food relief operations are disrupted.</p>
        <p>Tonight Eritrean separatist rebels claimed in a clandestine radio broadcast to have captured Addis Ababa's international airport. The capture could not be independently verified, although previous such claims over the rebel radio have often proved accurate.</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials, meanwhile, reported that the entire Ethiopian Navy had fled across the Red Sea to a port in Yemen. The navy, which was forced to flee the port of Assab when it was overrun by Eritrean rebels on Saturday, was believed to consist of up to 24 craft, including two 1960's Soviet frigates.</p>
        <p>With tensions high here, the Government mobilized 22 tanks from the presidential palace to set up a defensive perimeter on the southeast of the city, and ordered neighborhood militiamen in the capital to test-fire their weapons tonight, creating a fireworks display of tracer bullets and staccato burst gunfire.</p>
        <p>Diplomats said the air force base at Debre Zeit, 15 miles southeast of the capital, had been captured by Tigrean rebels after hours of heavy fighting with Government troops. The Associated Press quoted a rebel spokesman in London as saying some Soviet-made planes and helicopters were at the base when it was seized, although the agency quoted an unidentified source as saying 17 Soviet-made jets had flown to neighboring Djibouti before the base was overrun.</p>
        <p>Rebel groups based in Eritrea and Tigre provinces are the two most powerful forces in the fighting, with the Eritreans on the offensive in their northern province and the Tigreans tightening a ring around the capital to the south. They have formed a loose alliance that includes a third, smaller rebel force drawn from the Oromo tribe in southern Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>The rebel forces have made major gains since President Mengistu Haile Mariam resigned Tuesday and handed over power to his Vice President before taking refuge in Zimbabwe.  Question of Rebel Unity</p>
        <p>The guerrillas now appear to be in a position to demand the Government's virtual capitulation in the peace talks in London this week, but there is some question about whether the three factions will be able to reconcile their conflicting goals and demands.</p>
        <p>In a sign that the rebel alliance was becoming more unified, diplomats today reported that a joint Tigrean and Oromo rebel force had captured the western town of Dembi Dolo. It was the first time the two factions had coordinated efforts on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>In the talks in London, the Eritrean rebel group, which has fought for 30 years for autonomy for Eritrea, is expected to demand a popular referendum to decide the future of the Red Sea province. The Oromo rebels also seek autonomy or outright separatism for their provinces in the south, while the Tigrean rebels, who have advanced within 10 miles of the capital from the east, north and south, are fighting to replace the Amhara ethnic elite who have dominated the Government for years.</p>
        <p>The United States has proposed putting off the most problematic rebel demand, the issue of Eritrean separatism, so a transitional government including all groups can be established. That would coincide with a cease-fire and the scheduling of elections.</p>
