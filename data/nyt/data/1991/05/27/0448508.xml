        <p>The Bush Administration will submit a plan to Congress this week to increase Federal college tuition grants for the poor and eliminate them for about 400,000 students whose families earn more than $10,000 a year. The plan, which would begin in the 1994 fiscal year, has already met heavy criticism in Congress.</p>
        <p>As Congress prepares to take up the plan as it overhauls the Federal Higher Education Act, many of its members are sharply divided with the Administration over who should benefit from Federal aid for a college education: the poor and middle class, or only the very poor.</p>
        <p>The chief Federal program for undergraduates now provides $5.3 billion in direct grants to 3.4 million college students, most of them from families earning $35,000 a year or less. The Administration's plan would eliminate nearly 12 percent of the students from eligibility, which is based on need, not merit. In all, Federal programs provide $11.6 billion in grants and loans to 6 million students at nearly 8,500 institutions across the nation. Raising Maximum Grant by 54%</p>
        <p>Although only the broad outlines of the Administration's proposal have been made public, Education Secretary Lamar Alexander told House Speaker Thomas S. Foley last month that it would seek to raise the maximum undergraduate grant by 54 percent, to $3,700 a year, cutting out currently eligible families with incomes between $10,000 and $35,000. Total spending on higher education would increase to $12.6 billion in the 1992 fiscal year from $11 billion in 1991, but the number of students who receive all types of Federal financial aid would drop from 6 million to 5.7 million.</p>
        <p>At a House subcommittee hearing this month, Mr. Alexander testified that given budget restraints, the Administration preferred to focus aid on the poorest students to give them access to higher education.</p>
        <p>"We want to concentrate student financial aid on the lowest-income families," Mr. Alexander said. "That's putting our money where it will do the most." While borrowing to pay for a college education is "never easy," he said, middle-income students can minimize loans by attending less expensive state and community colleges where tuition is $2,000 a year or less. Some Oppose a Poverty Program</p>
        <p>But leading members of Congress say they will not go along with a proposal essentially transforming a major part of the higher education package into a poverty program. "Mr. Joe Six-Pack doesn't want to support programs that his family doesn't seem to get anything from," said Representative William D. Ford, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Education and Labor subcommittee responsible for aid to higher education. Mr. Ford's panel is holding hearings in the next several months on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1986, which expires at the end of the 1991 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Even some Republicans have been critical of the Administration proposal. Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, said the Administration plan "would present a serious erosion of middle-class students and their access" to higher education. She added that many needy working-class students were already excluded from Federal student aid programs because a family home or farm was counted in the eligibility formula and its value could have increased although the family's income had not.</p>
        <p>There are half a dozen Congressional proposals that could become alternatives to the Administration's plan. They include different formulas for the student grants, which are named after Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who sponsored the legislation in 1971 that created the grants. Mr. Ford proposes increasing the maximum grant to $5,000, while focusing on giving money to first-and second-year students. On the Senate side, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, would increase the grants to $3,000 and classify the program an "entitlement," which would guarantee its automatic financing from year to year.</p>
        <p>Figuring out how to pay for the programs is a major stumbling block for those who would expand it to the middle class. The new budget laws require any new financing for programs like to be offset by cuts in other domestic programs or higher taxes.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats say current budget restraints should not effect the way the programs are reorganized since they will not go into effect until the 1994 budget.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the Higher Education Act is to aid college students through federally guaranteed loans and direct grants. Over the years, eligibility requirements for this aid have steadily decreased the number of middle-class families who qualify.</p>
        <p>In overhauling the Higher Education Act many lawmakers also want a student financial aid package that relies less on loans and more on grants, which, they argue, will keep students from being burdened with huge debts after graduation and also stem the growing default rate on student loans. Middle-Income Families Hurt</p>
        <p>Representative E. Thomas Coleman, a Missouri Republican who is the ranking Republican on the subcommittee on aid to higher education, said that at a time when the marketplace demands more education and specialized training to meet long-term career goals, middle-income families are increasingly unable to afford tuition costs. The Administration's emphasis on choice, the right of parents to choose which elementary and secondary school to send their children to, should not be limited when it comes to higher education, he said.</p>
        <p>Supporters of keeping financial aid programs for lower- and middle-income people argue that such families need assistance because college tuition has risen 135 percent since 1980, while family income has risen 67 percent. For the same period, the maximum Pell grant, which once covered 41 percent of the average college bill, now covers 26 percent of that cost.</p>
        <p>They also point out that there has been a steady shift in Federal aid from direct Government grants to guaranteed private loans over the last 20 years. In 1975, grants made up 80 percent of all Federal financial aid to students. By 1989, that had slipped to 49 percent. The increase in loans has resulted in a rise in defaults, with the Government ultimately paying the cost.</p>
        <p>Senator Pell said the Administration's plan was "moving in precisely the wrong direction" and that larger grants for more students were needed.</p>
        <p>Some argue that the bottom line on how much is spent on higher education will depend on the budget. But Mr. Ford discounted that, saying that since it will take two years to reauthorize the act, there will be no effect on the budget until 1994. STUDENT AID AT A GLANCE</p>
        <p>Under the Higher Education Act, the Federal Government is spending $11.6 billion this year on grants, loans and fellowships for study at public and private colleges and universities, trade and technical schools and profit-making vocational schools. Here are some major programs.  Pell Grants</p>
        <p>Named for Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, it is the Government's principal grant program for neediest students. Grants are awarded directly to students based on need and college costs. The current maximum is $2,400.  Stafford Student Loan Program</p>
        <p>Named for former Senator Robert Stafford of Vermont and once known as the guaranteed student loan, it is the largest source of Federal aid to college students. U.S. subsidizes and guarantees loans from commercial banks to college students. Maximum loan for four years is $17,250. Campus-Based Programs</p>
        <p>Unlike the Pell grants and Stafford loans, which go directly to the individual student, this money goes to the institution, which determines eligibility and distributes the money. Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants</p>
        <p>Federal money for low-income students, distributed by colleges. Size of grant depends on need and amount allocated to school; maximum is $4,000. Perkins Loans</p>
        <p>Named for former Representative Carl Perkins of Kentucky. Gives money to colleges that make loans as part of a student's aid package.</p>
