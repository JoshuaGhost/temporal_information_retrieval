        <p>Hong Kong Tower Sale by Citibank</p>
        <p>Citibank N.A. agreed to sell for roughly $97.1 million its half of a Hong Kong office tower that serves as its reional headquarters. The sale, one of the biggest local property transactions this year, is to an unidentified party. A Citibank official said the bank made a profit of about $44.9 million on the deal.</p>
        <p>Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, bought half of the 38-story building, in the Causeway Bay district, in 1983. But 18 months ago, it decided to return to the central business district by taking a stake in a major new building to be completed next year. Steven Baker, Citibank's country corporate officer, said the sale of roughly 250,000 square feet of space in the Causeway Bay building would enable the bank to unite the bulk of its staff, which is now divided between the two buildings.</p>
