        <p>Two sergeants and two officers from a narcotics team in Brooklyn were indicted yesterday in connection with an arrest last year in which prosecutors say a drug dealer's apartment was illegally searched.</p>
        <p>Officers reported that $27,000 in cash they seized had been found on a table, but prosecutors said it had actually been taken from a locked trunk.</p>
        <p>The two sergeants, Rocco Poveromo, 32 years old, and Thomas Nostramo, 35, were charged with falsifying arrest records. They and Officer William Foley, 27, were also charged with official misconduct, criminal trespass and criminal mischief. Officer James Harkins, 26, was charged with first-degree perjury.</p>
        <p>The indictments stem from a three-month investigation by the department last year. Ten officers from the Brooklyn North Tactical Narcotics Team, including the four indicted yesterday, were reassigned in December after allegations that they mistreated prisoners and lied about evidence. Broke Trunk Lock, Charge Says</p>
        <p>At the time of the transfers, Chief Daniel F. Sullivan, the head of internal affairs, said that none of the 10 officers were corrupt. None of the six other officers has been brought up on criminal or departmental charges.</p>
        <p>A statement released by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said that Sergeants Poveromo and Nostramo and Officer Foley unlawfully entered the apartment of Manuel Gomez, 55, at 93 Williams Avenue in the East New York section, on Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>In filling out the arrest records, the sergeants claimed they found $27,000 on a table in plain sight, when they actually found it by breaking a lock on a trunk, the statement said. The indictment charges that Officer Harkins falsely testified about the arrest during a grand jury appearance on Oct. 9.</p>
        <p>All the defendants pleaded not guilty during their arraignment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gomez was sentenced to five years probation on Jan. 21.</p>
