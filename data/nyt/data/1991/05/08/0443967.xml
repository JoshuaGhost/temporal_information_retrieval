        <p>"VW Reaches Accord for Skoda Stake" (Business Day, April 20) reports Volkswagen's buying a majority share in the Czechoslovak auto maker. You discuss the concern of the Czechs to indemnify Volkswagen against claims under a new law for the return of property formerly confiscated by the Communists.</p>
        <p>I am a United States citizen -- this week 50 years in this great country -- born in Czechoslovakia and served in the United States armed forces in World War II. Several members of my family suffered greatly and perished during the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>I am a United States citizen -- this week 50 years in this great country -- born in Czechoslovakia and served in the United States armed forces in World War II. Several members of my family suffered greatly and perished during the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>Under the new Czech law on restitution, I would have to renounce my United States citizenship to perhaps get back my family's confiscated property, which is rightfully mine. That I will never do!</p>
        <p>The new law is patently unjust and unfair and should be repealed. This law will not, unfortunately, help the Czechs and Slovaks in stimulating the Western technical assistance and investments for which they have dire need. ERNEST H. SPILLAR Forest Hills, Queens, April 20, 1991</p>
