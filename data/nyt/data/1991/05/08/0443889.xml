        <p>The Rev. Dr. James H. Nichols, a Presbyterian minister who was a church historian and religious educator, died on Friday at his home in Bedford, Mass. He was 76 years old.</p>
        <p>He died of Alzheimer's disease, his family said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nichols joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1943 and became professor of modern church history before he left in 1962 to teach at the Princeton Theological Seminary. He was academic dean at the seminary for several years until he retired in 1983 as Mary McIntosh Bridge Professor of Modern European Church History.</p>
        <p>He was editor of Church History magazine for many years and wrote several books, including "Primer for Protestants," a lay teaching aid, and "History of Christianity (1650-1950)." He was the official historian of the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches in 1954 and was a Protestant observer at the Second Vatican Council.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nichols was born in Auburn, N.Y., and was a graduate of the Hotchkiss School and Yale, where he received a bachelor's degree before earning a master's at Harvard and returning to Yale for his doctorate. He was ordained in 1943.</p>
        <p>Surviving are two sons, Robert, of Chicago, and David, of Fort Meyers, Fla.; two daughters, Sue Miller of Boston and Barbara Nichols-Meeker of Denver; a sister, Grace Knight of Stockton, N.J., and nine grandchildren.</p>
