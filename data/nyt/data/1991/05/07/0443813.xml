        <p>Have you thought about pique lately? It's enjoying a revival, especially in such 60's-inspired styles as sun dresses with bouffant skirts and A-line shifts.</p>
        <p>After years of fabrics that cling, it's nice to contemplate wearing something made of a cotton that's sturdy and firm enough to give you a shape instead of the other way around. Granted, not all of today's pique clothes have the traditional bandbox crispness. They do have the familiar waffle-weave surface, but the feel is softer, more like linen.</p>

        <p>Have you thought about pique lately? It's enjoying a revival, especially in such 60's-inspired styles as sun dresses with bouffant skirts and A-line shifts.</p>
        <p>After years of fabrics that cling, it's nice to contemplate wearing something made of a cotton that's sturdy and firm enough to give you a shape instead of the other way around. Granted, not all of today's pique clothes have the traditional bandbox crispness. They do have the familiar waffle-weave surface, but the feel is softer, more like linen.</p>
        <p>Henri Bendel's pique dresses cost around $200. As the price tag goes up, so does the spanking starchy quality of the pique. Right now Bergdorf Goodman is full of perky white piques: suits with shorts or a slip of a skirt, and flared jackets fastened with zippers by Claude Montana; smartly squared-off cotton toppers from Salvatore Ferragamo, and curvy, short-sleeved jackets from Jean Muir. Prices are $500 to $2,000.</p>
        <p>Pique comes in all colors, but clean bright white is by far the most chic. The problem is keeping it white and crisp. Between wearings, a pique garment should be steam-ironed on the wrong side with a slight mist of spray starch.  Though some women swear by hand washing with a mild soap, most prefer to send their precious pique to a dry cleaner. A word of advice from Hallak Cleaners, at Second Avenue and 65th Street: Ask to have any white garment cleaned in a clear, purified solvent. That way, it should come back without a tinge of yellow residue.</p>
