        <p>This summer, as Coca-Cola pitches hot pop music, Pepsi-Cola will chill out.</p>
        <p>The Pepsi-Cola Company is scheduled to disclose on Sunday details of the summer 1991 promotion for its flagship Pepsi-Cola brand. Called "the Pepsi Summer Chill Out," the promotion is already the subject of teaser television commercials by BBDO Worldwide, New York, the Pepsi agency. One spot shows a family watching television in a living room in Oak Brook, Ill. -- interestingly, the home of the McDonald's Corporation, the No. 1 fountain account for Pepsi's archrival, Coke.</p>

        <p>A Pepsi spokesman declined to comment on the promotion, which press reports suggest will feature a national version of "License to Chill," a program Pepsi tested last summer offering consumers prizes and discounts.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola USA announced its summer 1991 plans for Coca-Cola Classic in March. That promotion, "Coca-Cola Pop Music," is centered on up-and-coming artists who record for Sony Music Entertainment Inc. McCann-Erickson Worldwide is the Coke Classic agency.</p>
