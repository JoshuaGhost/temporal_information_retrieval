        <p>Nearly 10,000 protesters battled riot policemen through clouds of tear gas in central Seoul today in disturbances prompted by the police killing of a student.</p>
        <p>A police vehicle was set on fire outside the Bank of Korea, the central bank, and tear gas sent crowds of terrified shoppers scurrying for cover during the worst protests in the city center this year.</p>
        <p>Roads were littered with spent gas canisters and leaflets calling for the ouster of President Roh Tae Woo.</p>
        <p>"Overthrow Roh Tae Woo!" students chanted as they confronted lines of riot policemen. Many passers-by applauded them, and a few joined the demonstrations. 70,000 Said to Protest</p>
        <p>The Hankook Ilbo newspaper said in its Sunday issue that about 70,000 people had protested nationwide, including about 20,000 in and around Seoul.</p>
        <p>About 10,000 anti-Government protesters rallied in Pusan, the country's second largest city, and a similar number assembled in the southwestern city of Kwangju, but no clashes were reported, the Yonhap news agency said.</p>
        <p>In the southern industrial city of Masan, 100 protesters were watched by more than 15 times as many riot policemen.</p>
        <p>Anti-Government demonstrations have erupted across South Korea since five riot policemen allegedly beat to death a 20-year-old student, Kang Kyung-dae, during a demonstration in Seoul on April 26.</p>
        <p>Three students have set themselves on fire in protest. Two have died, and doctors fear for the life of the third, a 19-year-old woman.</p>
        <p>The demonstrators -- mostly students, older dissidents and labor union members -- want Mr. Roh to apologize for Mr. Kang's death, dismiss his Cabinet and disband the detested Paegoldan, the plainclothes "skeleton corps" of riot police. Home Minister Dismissed</p>
        <p>Mr. Roh has expressed regret over the death and dismissed his Home Minister, while his Government said it had imposed curbs on the tactics used by the conscripted riot police.</p>
        <p>Today's clashes in Seoul suggested restraint on both sides. Students did not throw gasoline bombs, and the police fired tear gas with discretion and did not beat or pursue students.</p>
        <p>But witnesses said that the police often failed to give a warning before using tear gas as required under the new rules and that many riot policemen appeared frustrated at the restraints.</p>
        <p>Demonstrations are likely to come to a climax on the May 18 anniversary of the 1980 Kwangju massacre, when troops killed hundreds of civilians to put down an uprising.</p>
