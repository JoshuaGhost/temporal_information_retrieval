        <p>Protests over a proposed mandatory meal charge at Lafayette College, which would have added as much as $1,100 to the college's annual fees, have resulted in what many students consider to be a Pyrrhic victory. All students -- even those who do not use campus dining rooms -- must still buy the new meal ticket, called Flex Dollars, but none will pay more than $250 a semester for it.</p>
        <p>The added expense comes on the heels of a 9.5 percent rise in tuition, room and board that raised the total cost of attending Lafayette in the next academic year to $15,475.</p>

        <p>Protests over a proposed mandatory meal charge at Lafayette College, which would have added as much as $1,100 to the college's annual fees, have resulted in what many students consider to be a Pyrrhic victory. All students -- even those who do not use campus dining rooms -- must still buy the new meal ticket, called Flex Dollars, but none will pay more than $250 a semester for it.</p>
        <p>The added expense comes on the heels of a 9.5 percent rise in tuition, room and board that raised the total cost of attending Lafayette in the next academic year to $15,475.</p>
        <p>"I am not at all happy with it," said Frank Puskas, a junior government and law major from Easton, Pa. "I used to be on a 20-meal plan, and I didn't use half of it. So for this semester, I chose to take only breakfast. I saved a lot of money. Now, with Flex Dollars, I have to put out extra money that I probably won't use."</p>
        <p>Lafayette administrators proposed the Flex Dollars plan to cover the costs of the $16 million Farinon College Center, the new student center scheduled to open in the fall. Under the original plan, all students would have had to buy a food ticket for Farinon -- at a cost of $100 a semester for freshmen, $400 for fraternity members and $550 for everyone else. They could spend it on food there as they wished.  Freshmen to Pay $100</p>
        <p>Lafayette administrators, working with representatives of Wood Company, the campus caterers, said those charges would cover the costs of food and food preparation at Farinon.</p>
        <p>With the lower-priced ticket, "we hope not to have a loss," said Herman C. Kissiah, dean of students.</p>
        <p>"We will be monitoring this carefully," he said, to further reduce potential losses. "We have continued to try to get the catering costs down as much as possible."</p>
        <p>The lower charge -- $250 a semester for all students except freshmen, who will pay $100 -- was a compromise after undergraduate protests and Board of Trustees support for the students.</p>
        <p>About 350 of Lafayette's 2,000 students voiced opposition to the Flex Dollars Plan at a Student Government meeting on April 2, when Robert I. Rotberg, the college's president, discussed the student concerns.</p>
        <p>More than 300 students protested the plan at a sit-in on April 5 on the lawn in front of Marquis Hall. The Farinon center will replace Marquis Hall as the center for student activities. Students flashed signs reading "Just say no to more dough" and "$1,500 + $550 = bankrupt student" as members of the Board of Trustees walked by on their way to a luncheon. There, they discussed college expenses, including Flex Dollars, with Gregg Betheil, the student government president. Wanting 'to Have a Say'</p>
        <p>"It seemed like we had an issue people were interested in," said Mr. Betheil, a junior from Westwood, N.J., majoring in government and law. "It was clear after the April 2 Student Government meeting that the student body wants to have a say in the future of Lafayette College."</p>
        <p>That commitment was underscored in a Student Government petition, circulated at the sit-in, supporting a smaller tuition increase than college administrators had proposed, increased student representation in the decision making of the college and a compromise on the Flex Dollars plan. The petition, which was signed by 801 students, acknowledged that students would have to support the Farinon Center financially, but argued that mandatory meal costs should be kept to $100 a semester for everyone.</p>
        <p>Currently costs range from $672 a year for a lunch-only meal plan, five lunches a week, to $2,250 for a 20-meal-a-week plan, which is required for all freshmen.</p>
        <p>The trustees supported the students, instructing Mr. Kissiah, Mr. Betheil, Mr. Rotberg and Frederick J. Quivey, vice president for business affairs and treasurer, to negotiate a new plan.</p>
        <p>"As we went into the meeting with the trustees, student representatives made strong and persuasive arguments," Mr. Kissiah said last week. "The board felt in sympathy with student concerns."</p>
        <p>But students are less than delighted with the results. "In general, the plan is a good idea," said Eddie Albert, a sophomore from Pittsburgh. "People are upset about it being forced on us. The administration wants to make sure the Farinon meal plan works by making us pay."</p>
        <p>Spencer Houldin, a senior government and law major from Washington, Conn., and former president of the Interfraternity Council, said that many fraternity members supported Farinon Center, but that most felt that they should not be forced to take part in Flex Dollars for a plan they would probably not use.</p>
        <p>"We would choose no Flex Dollars if we had a choice," Mr. Houldin said.</p>
