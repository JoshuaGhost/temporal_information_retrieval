        <p>Germany appealed today to foreign companies to invest in eastern Germany, promising them large subsidies.</p>
        <p>Only 5 percent of all investment in the former Communist economy so far has come from abroad, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told an economics seminar here.</p>
        <p>An investor placing 100 million marks, ($58 million), in eastern Germany would receive state support of up to 57.3 million marks, ($33 million), he said. The aid would be in the form of tax-free grants, investment subsidies, tax write-offs and special depreciation rates.</p>
        <p>As part of the drive, the Bonn Government will send Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann to the United States next week to promote eastern Germany as a business opportunity for American companies.</p>
        <p>The state-owned companies have a total debt of 105 billion marks ($61 billion). Bonn has ruled out across-the-board debt relief but promised to review individual cases.</p>
