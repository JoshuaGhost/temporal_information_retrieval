        <p>Although ABC is canceling "Thirtysomething," the weekly ABC drama that involved an advertising agency in many of its story lines, that fictitious agency lives on, in a way, via classified advertising.</p>
        <p>Among the ads appearing in help-wanted section of The New York Times on Sunday was one seeking a public relations account executive "who is ready to move UP!" The ad listed an address and a fax number in care of DAA -- the name of the agency on the television series, which is ending its run on Tuesday after four seasons.</p>
        <p>The actual identity of this DAA is Jericho Promotions, a New York firm that handles public relations for clients including the Deutsch Inc. ad agency. When Jericho advertised under its own name, "I never got responses like tese," said a partner, Eric Yaverbaum. The tally so far, he said, is 447 resumes and counting.</p>
        <p>The ad asked applicants to contact "Myles Trentel," a garbling of Miles Drentell, the name of the series character who headed DAA. Asked if it was changed for legal reasons, Mr. Yaverbaum replied, "We didn't have the right spelling on the name."  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA</p>
