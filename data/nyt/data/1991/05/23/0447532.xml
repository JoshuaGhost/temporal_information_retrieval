        <p>The dollar rose on technical factors in extremely quiet trading yesterday.</p>
        <p>Gold fell 90 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to close at $356.30 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a bid of $355.50, off $1.</p>
        <p>Analysts said there was no news to sway the currency market. Ronald Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, described the dollar's movements as a "technical retracement" after losses on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Traders were adjusting their positions ahead of today's scheduled release of data on April orders for durable goods and the weekly state unemployment claims. The markets were also beginning to wind down before the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.</p>
        <p>The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in New York, trading on speculation that the Bank of Japan might lower its discount rate. A lowering of rates in a country generally tends to cause its currency to drop in value.</p>
        <p>The dollar closed at 137.80 yen in New York, up from 137.30 late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the United States currency fell 0.70 yen, to a closing 137.45 yen, but it was quoted higher in London at 138.00 yen.</p>
        <p>The British pound slipped against the dollar. Sterling fell to $1.7280 in New York, from $1.7370 on Tuesday. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.7270 from $1.7365.</p>
        <p>Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7227 German marks, up from 1.7128; 1.4602 Swiss francs, up from 1.4485; 5.8455 French francs, up from 5.8140; 1,279.00 Italian lire, up from 1,272.00, and 1.14975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14895.</p>
        <p>Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.7210 German marks, up from 1.7125; 1.4598 Swiss francs, up from 1.4480; 5.8425 French francs, up from 5.8100; 1.9390 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9290; 1,277.50 Italian lire, up from 1,271.25, and 1.1490 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1488.</p>
        <p>Silver fell 0.3 cent on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.032 an ounce. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.03, from $4.05 late Tuesday.</p>
