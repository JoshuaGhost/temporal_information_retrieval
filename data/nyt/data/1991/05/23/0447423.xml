        <p>ELEANOR HARRIS HOWARD is the author of a play called "I Don't Want to Die on Long Island," which had a staged reading in East Hampton last summer. The fact of the matter is that Mrs. Howard doesn't want to live or die on Long Island, or any other island or territory that isn't New York City.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Howard and her husband, Jack, who is chairman of Scripps Howard Broadcasting Corporation, have a large apartment in Manhattan and a second home on Centre Island, L.I. They have had the house, on the North Shore, for more than two decades. It has a living room with a fieldstone fireplace at one end, a barbecue fireplace at the other, Mexican tile floors and sliding glass doors. Mrs. Howard unhesitatingly admits that it is "beautiful."</p>
        <p>"If the Centre Island house was at 42d Street and Broadway, I'd be delirious," she said. "Jack loves going out there, oh yes, but I. . . ." Well, she added, "if ever I had to really live out of the city, I'd see divorce on every wall."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Howard's attitude, one that not so incidentally inspired the plot of her play, is by no means unusual. She has plenty of company, both male and female, among couples who spend weekends at a second residence. In many cases, although both husband and wife agreed to a country house, one of them did so primarily for the sake of marital harmony, and left to their druthers, could happily live without greener pastures.</p>
        <p>In the case of Dr. Mike Segal, he already had a large, rambling wood-and-glass weekend retreat near Stockbridge, Mass., when he married Miriam Marshall 12 years ago. "I love it, " said Dr. Segal, the medical director of Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Greater New York. "I feel relaxed when I'm there."</p>
        <p>But Ms. Marshall, who owns a trade development company, said: "By the time I've even started the weekend, I'm exhausted from organizing it. And when we get there, Mike becomes the country squire and I'm Cinderella before the ball."</p>
        <p>But it's more than buying the food, tidying up, fixing and arranging the repairs of the numerous things that go wrong that Ms. Marshall doesn't like. "When I jog, the dogs come out and bark at me," she said. "I long to be back in Central Park."</p>
        <p>During the 17 years Constance and Stephen Spahn have owned their cabin in the woods near Pawling, N.Y., there have been hundreds of weekends that Mrs. Spahn would have preferred to spend in the city. But Mr. Spahn, headmaster of the Dwight School, felt otherwise, as did their two sons, Blake, now 20, and Kirk, 14.</p>
        <p>"Stephen loves the tranquility of the country, and I love the excitement of the city," said Mrs. Spahn, an owner of Global Finance magazine.</p>
        <p>But for several years, the Spahns have rarely got either country tranquillity or city excitement. They spend their weekends accompanying their sons, who are ranking tennis players, on a round of tournaments. The cabin is temporarily unoccupied.</p>
        <p>At whatever tournament they end up, Mrs. Spahn said, "Stephen dreams of the country; I dream of the city." Eventually, the tournaments will end and the cabin weekends will resume and "I'll still dream of the city," Mrs. Spahn said.</p>
        <p>There are, naturally, varying degrees of resistance to country houses. Some husbands or wives would be ecstatic to say a permanent goodbye to their weekend places. Some do not want to go regularly or frequently but are not against an occasional visit. Some dislike the thought of going but get into the mood once they're there. And some, like Regis Philbin, start out by fighting the idea and gradually become more amenable, even seduced, within limits.</p>
        <p>The Philbins -- Regis of the ABC morning show "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," and his wife, Joy -- bought a house in Bedford, N.Y., four years ago. Mrs. Philbin was enthusiastic, Mr. Philbin lukewarm, at most. One of the reasons for the purchase, he recalled, was to get a respite from city noises: sanitation trucks, fire engines, blaring loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>"The first night we were in our country house, what happened?" he said. What happened -- he added appropriate sound effects -- was "12 big black ominous-looking crows divebombing our property." As far as he was concerned, the change from New York could be described simply as "from an insane asylum to bedlam."</p>
        <p>Then the Philbins put in a pool, but due to a number of circumstances, including bad weather, it has not been used much. Mr. Philbin said: "I don't know why I'm complaining. I did have three swims, I figure at about $6,385 a swim."</p>
        <p>Then, too, he can't forget the weekend the thermostat froze -- "that was a lot of fun" -- and the crows continue to divebomb regularly. But somehow, despite it all, Mr. Philbin no longer fights the weekend commute. It could be that he is plumb worn out.</p>
        <p>Alix Segal admits that she always was more enthusiastic about their East Hampton house than her husband, Joel. But over the years, they've reached a compromise. Mr. Segal, an executive vice president of McCann-Erickson, the advertising firm, does not struggle against going out to the house. When he doesn't want to go, he doesn't.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Segal is somewhat ambivalent about his attitude. She would like him to spend more weekends with her in the country but, she said, she also appreciates his desire to remain in the city. "Often he's too tired to go on Friday, and in some ways it's more stressful to go for a short time than to stay in the city," she said.</p>
        <p>Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, was not against a weekend house, but only on the condition that it would be used on a "moment-to-moment" basis -- no pre-arranged plans and certainly no back-of-the-head ideas about every weekend. On the other hand, his wife, Pat, loves spending weekends at the house, in Roxbury, Conn. But, she said: "He was giving me such pressure about not giving him any pressure that it was driving me crazy. Even on Friday night or Saturday morning, he'd say, 'I don't know yet.' "</p>
        <p>So recently, Mrs. Schoenfeld, chairwoman of the Women's Project and Productions, a theater organization, adopted a new approach. She told her husband to do what he wanted to do but added, "I'm going Saturday morning and coming back Sunday night." The resulting conversation went like this:</p>
        <p>"Are you going alone?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Don't you want me to go?"</p>
        <p>"Sure I'd like to have you go, but I don't want to pressure you."</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Schoenfeld said he thought he'd go.</p>
        <p>Which leaves only one thing up in the air: will the strategy continue to work?</p>
