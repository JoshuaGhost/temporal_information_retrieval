        <p>Kurdish opposition leaders and the Government of President Saddam Hussein will open a second round of peace talks in the next few days, taking up crucial issues like international guarantees for greater Kurdish autonomy and how to divide oil revenues from the region between Baghdad and the local Kurdish majority.</p>
        <p>Foreign diplomats and Iraqi officials appear optimistic that the talks could lead to an agreement giving Iraq's northern Kurdish areas a greater measure of self-government. They also hope the accord will encourage the return of the Iraqi Kurds who fled to the mountainous border regions with Turkey and Iran after the unsuccessful uprising in the wake of Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>After talks here last week with the Iraqi Government, Jalal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union for Kurdistan, said he and three other opposition leaders had reached agreement on the broad outline of a new peace pact.</p>
        <p>That announcement, together with the amnesty Baghdad has offered returning Kurds, is encouraging a sizable number of Kurdish refugees to go home or seek shelter in the zone that United States and allied troops have set up in northern Iraq. According to Iraqi Government figures, 270,000 Kurds have returned home of the 1.5 million who fled.</p>
        <p>After last week's talks, Mr. Talbani said the four opposition factions would be returning in early May to iron out details of the pact. President Hussein was shown on Iraqi television last week embracing the Kurdish leaders.</p>
        <p>Under the emerging agreement, which is based on an accord first made in 1970 but which the Kurds say Baghdad never put in place, Kurdistan would be given a high degree of autonomy, with a reorganization of the administration and free elections for a separate Kurdish legislature within six months. In addition, Iraq would reduce its military presence in the north.</p>
        <p>But foreign diplomats say there is still disagreement over the future status of the oil-rich Kirkuk region, which accounts for about a quarter of Iraq's oil reserves, as well as over plans put forward by the United States, Britain and France for the United Nations Security Council to guarantee the Kurds' new rights. Hussein Seeks Central Control</p>
        <p>The original 1970 agreement on Kurdish autonomy broke down in large part because the Kurds accused President Hussein of trying to retain control over Kirkuk and its oil fields by moving large numbers of Arabs into the region in advance of a planned census to determine its ethnic status.</p>
        <p>At a news conference last week, Mr. Talabani said the Kurdish opposition parties no longer regarded Kirkuk as an integral part of Kurdistan. But diplomats here say that other factions, including Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party, are less conciliatory and at a minimum want to be guaranteed a larger share of its oil revenues.</p>
        <p>President Hussein, however, wants to retain central government control over the Kirkuk oil fields partly because they are the country's only readily exportable source of oil if the Security Council allows Iraq to start selling oil again to pay for food and other essential imports.</p>
        <p>Diplomats say it may be some time before Iraq is in a position to export oil from its southern oil fields because of the damage they suffered during the war and subsequent unsuccessful Shiite uprising in the region. Shiite rebels were accused of occupying a number of oil installations being built by Soviet engineers and destroying much of the new equipment there. Turks Ready to Open Pipeline</p>
        <p>The Turkish Government has also made clear that it is ready to reopen the oil pipeline connecting the Kirkuk fields to a loading terminal on its Mediterranean coast as soon as the Security Council gives permission.</p>
        <p>The trade embargo against Iraq is estimated to be costing Turkey over $3 billion a year in lost exports, which Ankara is anxious to see restored as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>While Britain and France are leading the drive for any new agreement on Kurdish autonomy to be backed up by some form of international guarantee including a possible United Nations police force in the region, the Soviet Union and China remain skeptical, saying this sets a worrying precedent for the council interfering in other countries' internal affairs.</p>
