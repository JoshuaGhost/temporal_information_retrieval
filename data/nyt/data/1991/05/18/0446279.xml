        <p>One man was killed and one was injured yesterday in separate incidents in lower Manhattan as they boarded subway trains between cars and fell to the tracks, the Transit Authority said. An unidentified man jumped onto an IRT train at the Bowling Green station about 6:30 A.M., fell to the roadbed and was killed, said a Transit Authority spokesman, Bob Previdi. Later, a 48-year-old man boarded a northbound No. 5 train between the cars at 5:40 P.M. in the Union Square station, fell and lost his right hand, said Termaine Garden, another authority spokesman.</p>
