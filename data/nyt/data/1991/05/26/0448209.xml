        <p>Some look a bit like bowling balls. Others resemble dumbbells and vases. They produce a variety of sounds like dripping water or rhythmic heartbeats. They are called udu drums, and are designed and sculptured by 43-year-old Frank Giorgini.</p>
        <p>The word udu means "pot" in the language of the Ibo tribe of Nigeria, Mr. Giorgini said. The drums are made using traditional Nigerian pottery techniques that he learned from Abbas Ahuwan, a potter of the Kaje tribe and a professor at Ahmadu Bello University, in Zaria, Nigeria. They met while Mr. Giorgini was visiting Nigeria in 1985.</p>

        <p>Some look a bit like bowling balls. Others resemble dumbbells and vases. They produce a variety of sounds like dripping water or rhythmic heartbeats. They are called udu drums, and are designed and sculptured by 43-year-old Frank Giorgini.</p>
        <p>The word udu means "pot" in the language of the Ibo tribe of Nigeria, Mr. Giorgini said. The drums are made using traditional Nigerian pottery techniques that he learned from Abbas Ahuwan, a potter of the Kaje tribe and a professor at Ahmadu Bello University, in Zaria, Nigeria. They met while Mr. Giorgini was visiting Nigeria in 1985.</p>
        <p>The drums can take a month to form, dry and fire. They are played by placing the palm of one hand on a hole on the side while opening and closing a hole on top with the other hand. They can be struck with the fingers, slapped or struck with a soft mallet. "Sliding" rhythms are also possible.</p>
        <p>George Jinda, a percussionist with the Manhattan group Special EFX, was one of the first musicians to use the drum on an album. The drums have also been featured on world tours by Miles Davis and Sting, and were used on the sound tracks of such movies as "Arachnophobia," "Die Hard 2" and "Ghost."</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Giorgini's designs are on exhibit at the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art in Roslyn, L.I., and at the Art Awareness Gallery in Lexington, N.Y. Others are part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>The drums cost $100 to $1,200. In New York, they are available at Manny's Music Store at 156 West 48th Street, (212) 819-0576; the Music Inn at 169 West Fourth Street (212) 243-5715, and by mail from Mr. Giorgini's gallery in Freehold, N.Y. Information: (518) 634-2559.</p>
