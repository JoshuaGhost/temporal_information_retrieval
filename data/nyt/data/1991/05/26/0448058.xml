        <p>"EVERYTHING IN THE CARIBBEAN IS sweeter," declares my Havana-born friend over dessert, gazing into my eyes just long enough to make me wonder if he's referring to something other than the rich Cuban vanilla-egg custard that's just arrived at our table. The natillas quiver in their cone-shaped aluminum cups, so milky yellow, lush and creamy that they dare you to stick in a finger. Or two. I blush, unsure whether the source of my embarrassment is the line I'm being fed or the pudding.</p>
        <p>For me, sweetness is the flavor of guilt, but I am a child of America, raised on fluoride, food groups and the virtuous leafy green. In the Caribbean, home of the world's sweetest sweets, sugar carries none of this troublesome nutritional stigma. There, sugar is king, and sweetness the expression of life's most delectable and perfect moments.</p>
        <p>Sweetness resonates with meaning for Caribbean people, no matter what their race or language. "Doux-doux" -- French Creole for "sweet-sweet" -- is what a Trinidadian or Haitian man will breathe seductively into his lady's ear. "Sweet,</p>
        <p>too</p>
        <p>sweet," is how the man from Jamaica, or perhaps Grenada, will respond to a biting joke, or the sway of a female bottom. And when the Cuban salsa queen Celia Cruz is really cooking, she tosses back her head and bursts out with her delicious trademark roar: "Azucar!"</p>
        <p>The Caribbean affinity for sweetness is not a simple matter of taste, but of culture and history. On Columbus's second voyage to the West Indies, he stuck some sugar cane stalks in the ground -- a planting that would prove to be of far greater world consequence than any flag. The cane, native to the South Pacific, took to the rich Caribbean soil, and with the addition of intensive cultivation by forced labor, it thrived. Sugar transformed the eating habits of one civilization, and the economic and social history of another.</p>
        <p>Slavery and its legacy of exploitation and underdevelopment, not tooth decay or hyperglycemia, is the real wickedness lurking within each snow-white teaspoon. But sugar itself managed to escape the disgrace of its origins. From the beginning, it graced the tables of both plantation owner and slave -- masters hoarded the white, highly refined granular stuff you find in the supermarket while slaves received rations of molasses (a refinery byproduct) and occasionally an oblong loaf of the much tastier unrefined brown sugar.</p>
        <p>Today, these same loaves, packed in convenient plastic twist-tied bags, fly off the shelves of West Indian markets in Brooklyn during fruitcake season at Christmas. The Caribbean's first and most successful product is a key ingredient of Creole cuisine.</p>
        <p>One of the first things I learned when I started to hang out in Caribbean kitchens is that sugar is much more than a mere sweetener. In the hands of the Creole cook, it is a protean substance with endless permutations of form and personality. Burned slowly to a black syrup in a seasoned iron pot, it becomes a food coloring and slightly bitter flavoring agent for everything from dark, rich Jamaican black cake to rice casseroles. Boiled with water, it transforms, in stages, from a sweet liquid used in rum punches and soft drinks to a sticky clear syrup that thickens puddings to a crystalline, jaw-breaking hard candy.</p>
        <p>The desserts of the Caribbean may lack the high artistry perfected by the confectioners and patissiers of Europe's elite, but they are no less ingenious. In Nitza Villapol's -- she's the Cuban Betty Crocker -- classic 1950's cookbook, "Cocina al Minuto," there are more than 100 pages devoted to lovingly detailed recipes for bizcochos, flans, pudins and tortas made with local delicacies like coconut water, calabaza (pumpkin) and even African yams. On the streets of Port of Spain, Trinidad, a former British colony, vendors peddle a soft, malty handmade ice cream laced with Guinness stout, while roadside stands in Kingston, Jamaica, sell tiny paper-wrapped squares of fruit-flavored sugar fudge called guava cheese.</p>
        <p>Caribbean sweets are comfort food; these are not exotic, showoffy bonbons for the upper class, but simple pleasures, homey treats. Since Caribbean people have many roots, so do their desserts. Tooloom, the chewy, irresistible Trinidad molasses, spice and coconut sweetmeat, was first prepared in plantation kitchens by Afro-Caribbean mothers for their children. The dense, rum-saturated black fruitcake of the former British colony is a tropical cousin of the plum pudding, but it also carries a hint of West African folkways: women occasionally spike the batter with God knows what to insure that their lover will be faithful. (When a Caribbean man walks around goo-goo-eyed and besotted, people say with a laugh: "He eat de cake.") And the deliriously decorated multistoried architectural cakes of the Spanish Caribbean are the quintessence of Mediterranean excess. Once, in a Santo Domingo</p>
        <p>reposteria,</p>
        <p>I found myself attacking a luxuriously appointed bizcocho that contained twice as much icing as cake; it was like eating the ruffles of an infanta's petticoats.</p>
        <p>Yes, it was delicious -- and yes, I felt guilty even as I licked up the last luscious smears of vanilla cream. Coming from a Sweet'n Low society, it's hard to make the transition to an environment in which eating sugar is a part of cultural identity, something you do without a second thought. To experience fully the sweetness of the tropics is to pass into another world. Sometimes, when flying over the Caribbean, I imagine I can even see the granular white dividing line that cuts the hemisphere into portions: north and south, first and third, nutra and sweet.</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that a crossover has two directions. "It wasn't until I got to the United States at the age of 16 that I discovered that sugar was supposed to be bad -- imagine," says Havana Man, ladling a small mountain of disreputable white powder into his cafe. "I mean, this is something we ate all the time at home. We sucked sugar cane straight from the field. We squeezed the cane into juice. Suddenly, you go up north, and what you know becomes wrong!" He grunts, then stirs another spoonful -- No. 5 -- into the coffee, smiling with a sweetness that has not a trace of remorse. "Viva la patria!" GUINNESS STOUT ICE CREAM  2 tablespoons cornstarch  1 cup water  1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk  1 1/2 cups evaporated milk  1/4 teaspoon salt  2 cups sugar  1/2 cup Guinness stout.</p>
        <p>1. In a heavy saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch in the water and cook, stirring constantly with a wire whisk, over medium heat until the mixture thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Reduce the heat to low and stir in both milks, salt and sugar. Cook, stirring, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Remove from the heat and let cool. Stir in the stout and pour into a freezer-proof bowl and place in the freezer.</p>
        <p>4. When the mixture starts to set, about 45 minutes to 1 hour, remove from the freezer and whip well. Return the mixture to the freezer and allow to freeze through, about 2 hours.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 5 1/2 cups ice cream. JAMAICAN BLACK CAKE  2 cups mixed dried fruit (equal parts raisins, currants, prunes and dried cherries)  1 cup Guinness stout  1/4 cup muscatel or fruit-flavored brandy  1/2 to 3/4 cup dark West Indian rum (preferably Appleton, Old Oak or Cockspur)  6 ounces butter  1/2 cup sugar  2 large or 3 medium eggs  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  2 tablespoons burnt-sugar coloring (available at West Indian markets; see note)  1 cup flour  1 teaspoon baking powder.</p>
        <p>1. Place the dried fruit in a glass or ceramic bowl and cover with the Guinness stout, the muscatel or brandy and 1/4 cup of the rum. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 days (and up to several weeks -- the preferred method). Check the mixture every other day: if the fruit has soaked up all the liquor, add another splash of rum or stout and stir.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</p>
        <p>3. Grind the fruit mixture to a mushy pulp in a blender or food processor. Measure out 2 cups of the mixture and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time.</p>
        <p>5. Add the vanilla, nutmeg and burnt-sugar coloring; mix well</p>
        <p>6. In another bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder</p>
        <p>7. Add, alternately, the fruit mixture and dry ingredients to the batter, mixing until just incorporated after each addition. Do not beat.</p>
        <p>8. Pour the batter into a 9-by-1 1/2-inch deep round pan and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.</p>
        <p>9. While the cake is still warm, splash the remaining 1/4 cup of rum over the top. Let cool. The finished cake is quite moist, almost like an English plum pudding. It is at its best when served a day or two after baking, and it will last for two weeks or more if kept in the refrigerator and occasionally topped up with rum.</p>
        <p>Yield: One 9-inch cake.</p>
        <p>Note: To make the burnt-sugar coloring yourself, caramelize 1/4 cup sugar in a small, heavy saucepan. Remove from heat and add 1/4 cup of boiling water. Stir to combine. You will have about 1/2 cup of the mixture, more than enough. TOOLOOM (Trinidadian molasses and coconut sweetmeat)  1 cup dark molasses  1/2 cup sugar  1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  2 cups freshly grated coconut  2 tablespoons of shortening or butter.</p>
        <p>1. Heat the molasses in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sugar, and cook, stirring constantly, until it is dissolved, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Stir in the nutmeg and coconut and continue stirring until the mixture is stiff and the coconut is cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Remove from the heat. Form into 1 1/2-inch balls on a baking sheet lined with wax paper or aluminum foil that has been heavily greased with the shortening or butter. Allow to cool.</p>
        <p>Yield: Two dozen balls. NATILLA (Cuban cinnamon and vanilla custard, adapted from Nitza Villapol's "Cocina al Minuto")  2 cups milk  1 stick cinnamon  Pinch salt  1 quarter-size piece of lime peel  4 egg yolks  1/2 cup sugar  2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 1/8 cup water  Scrapings of 1/4 vanilla bean, or more to taste  Ground cinnamon, for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Place the milk, cinnamon stick, salt and lime peel in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, letting the spice and lime steep in the milk.</p>
        <p>2. In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar and the dissolved cornstarch until blended well.</p>
        <p>3. Discard the cinnamon stick and lime peel and combine the infused milk with the egg yolks in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. When the mixture thickens to soft-custard consistency, turn the heat off and add the vanilla. Pour into a large dessert dish (like a 7-inch souffle dish) or 4 individual 1/2-cup dessert ramekins and chill.</p>
        <p>4. Serve sprinkled with ground cinnamon.</p>
        <p>Yield: Four 1/2-cup servings. BONIATILLO (Cuban sweet-potato pudding)  1 1/2 pounds Caribbean sweet potatoes (these are the red-skinned, white- fleshed tubers called batatas; choose ones with light red skin -- the flesh is moister)  3/4 to 1 cup sugar, or to taste  1/2 cup water  1 quarter-size piece of lime peel  1 stick cinnamon  2 egg yolks, beaten  1/4 cup of dry Sherry (like palo or manzanilla)  Whipped cream (optional).</p>
        <p>1. Peel the batatas and cut into 1-inch chunks. Place them in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and boil until they are tender but not mushy, about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Drain, then place the batatas in a blender or food processor and process to a smooth puree. If the mixture is too thick (like dry mashed potatoes), add a little water.</p>
        <p>3. Place the sugar, 1/2 cup water, lime and cinnamon stick in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the syrup reaches the soft-thread stage (230 degrees), about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Reduce the heat to low, remove the lime and cinnamon stick, and add the batata puree, stirring constantly. Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring, until the mixture is well blended.</p>
        <p>5. Remove from the heat and stir in the beaten egg yolks. Return to low heat and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring.</p>
        <p>6. Stir in the Sherry and pour the mixture into a dessert dish, like a 7-inch souffle dish. Chill thoroughly before serving. Serve with whipped cream if desired.</p>
        <p>Yield: Four to six servings.</p>
