        <p>One of six St. John's University students charged with taking part in a sexual assault on a female student pleaded guilty last week to reduced charges and is prepared to testify against the other suspects, it was disclosed yesterday.</p>
        <p>The plea by Joseph Reilly, 21 years old, was revealed to lawyers for his co-defendants in State Supreme Court in Queens as opening arguments were made yesterday in the trial of three of the co-defendants on charges of sodomy and other crimes.</p>
        <p>Court records indicate that Mr. Reilly, who had been charged with first-degree sexual abuse, a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison, pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year. Under a deal with the prosecutor, he might avoid jail.</p>
        <p>According to the court documents, which Justice Joan O'Dwyer ordered sealed after the plea but unsealed yesterday, if Mr. Reilly testifies truthfully for the prosecution, the prosecutors will recommend that he be sentenced to three years' probation. Last evening his lawyer, Patrick T. Burke, said, "If he's called, he'll testify." Mr. Reilly is from Monsey, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The case involves charges that four of the six accused men -- including the three now on trial -- sexually abused the woman after she was rendered helpless by alcohol on March 1, 1990.</p>
        <p>Some of the men are accused of forcing the 22-year-old woman to perform oral sex on them after verbally "pressuring" her to drink at a house near the school's campus in Jamaica, a prosecutor, Peter Reese, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The three, who were members of the St. John's lacrosse team at the time and have been suspended from college pending the outcome of the crimnal case, are Walter Gabrinowitz, 23; Andrew Draghi, 21, and Matthew Grandinetti, 22, all of Bethpage, L.I.</p>
        <p>"This case is about sex between several men and one woman, and it is about consent," Mr. Gabrinowitz's lawyer, Stephen Scaring, said. "He did not force her to do anything," Mr. Draghi's lawyer, Larry Silverman, said of his client. He said the prosecution was "trying to confuse presence with participation, agreement with compulsion."</p>
        <p>Mr. Grandinetti's lawyer, Benedict S. Gullo Jr., said that Thomas Dean, a student who is another expected key prosecution witness and who agreed to testify in return for not being prosecuted, "is a liar and will say anything in his own self-interest."</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 30, 1991, Thursday</p>
        <p>A headline yesterday about the sexual assault trial of three St. John's University students misstated the charges against them. They are accused of sexual abuse and sodomy, not rape.</p>
