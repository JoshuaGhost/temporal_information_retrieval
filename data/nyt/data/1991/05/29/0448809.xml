        <p>Pressing to avoid a showdown over Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's threatened vetoes, legislative leaders today presented a $51.9 billion budget plan to the Governor that includes about $1.2 billion in new taxes and fees and a program to curb the escalating costs of Medicaid.</p>

        <p>Pressing to avoid a showdown over Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's threatened vetoes, legislative leaders today presented a $51.9 billion budget plan to the Governor that includes about $1.2 billion in new taxes and fees and a program to curb the escalating costs of Medicaid.</p>
        <p>The leaders urged Mr. Cuomo to accept the plan or negotiate with them over it, but their aides said that if he refused, they would begin passing the budget in the Legislature anyway and dare him to veto the parts he does not like.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo refused to commit himself, and he reiterated concerns he has expressed in recent days that the budget could be out of balance. At a news conference tonight, the Governor, in a clear reference to vetoes, said: "I'm not giving up any options. What I don't like and can affect, I will affect."  Petroleum Import Tax</p>
        <p>A budget package now, even if part of it was unraveled by gubernatorial vetoes, would finally clear the way for New York City and other municipalities to begin receiving billions of dollars in desperately needed state aid that has been held up ever since lawmakers failed to meet the April 1 statutory deadline for approving a budget.</p>
        <p>About half of the $1.2 billion in new taxes and fees would come from a tax on petroleum importers, which would be passed on to consumers in the form of an increase of up to 6 cents in the pump price of gasoline. There would also be a 15 percent increase in motor-vehicle registration fees.</p>
        <p>Among other revenue measures planned by the lawmakers is a new state lottery game to begin this fall that would be based on the scores of the Giants, Jets and Buffalo Bills football games. Officials said prizes would not be based on who won a game, but rather on the total scoring, regardless of whether a team won or lost.</p>
        <p>The budget plan, which was released so late in the day that local government leaders and Wall Street analysts did not provide any detailed reaction to it, restores about $600 million in cuts that Mr. Cuomo had sought in aid to school districts and local governments and provides for even sharper cuts than he had proposed for a variety of state agencies.</p>
        <p>The package also provides for nearly $1 billion in cost containment measures for the state's Medicaid program, including new limits on the number of times that some Medicaid recipients can use certain services each year.</p>
        <p>And it commits the state to establishing a "managed care" or health management organization-style system for Medicaid that could ultimately save hundreds of millions of dollars a year by deterring many recipients from using hospital emergency rooms for routine care, said the State Assembly majority leader, James R. Tallon Jr., a Binghamton Democrat.</p>
        <p>The plan fails to create a fund of guaranteed state money for a range of environmental programs, an initiative sought by Mr. Cuomo in the wake of the defeat last fall of the $1.97 billion environmental bond act, although officials said discussions about such a fund were still going on. Relief From Some Cuts</p>
        <p>For New York City, legislative officials said, the state budget plan would provide about $250 million in relief from the Governor's cuts, a figure that Mayor David N. Dinkins has identified as a bare minimum needed in the city's own tortuous bid to restore fiscal stability. Under the legislative budget, overall state aid to the city would still decline, from $6.1 billion, to $5.95 billion, in the coming fiscal year.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the two top legislative leaders said they were hoping to avert any need for vetoes by the Governor because they believed Mr. Cuomo would support their agreement.</p>
        <p>"I think we have a budget," said the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., after a four-hour meeting with his members. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said the Assembly was ready "to proceed, to close down a budget."</p>
        <p>The legislative agreement reflected a decision to raise petroleum taxes by about $150 million more than what was in a tentative budget accord last week, and, in the face of heavy lobbying by business groups, to drop a proposed tax on corporations' gross receipts.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the continuing differences between Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature is the intention of legislators to spend more on aid to local governments and schools than he has proposed and less than he wants on many state operations, including highway maintenance and the state police.</p>
        <p>In threatening to carry out the largest set of vetoes of budget items in his eight-year tenure, the Governor was taking aim at many of the lawmakers' proposed restorations. Such a move would prolong some of the budget tumult here for at least several more days as Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders haggle over a deal to end their dispute, or as the Legislature takes the uncertain course of trying to override Mr. Cuomo's vetoes.  No Cuomo Vetoes Upset</p>
        <p>Although the Legislature prevailed in a 1982 dispute with the Governor then, Hugh L. Carey, when it overrode his vetoes of nearly $1 billion in spending in the state budget, it has not been able to override any of the 547 vetoes by Mr. Cuomo in his tenure, including about 20 involving budget items.</p>
        <p>In the most extreme case, attempts by Mr. Cuomo to reduce certain legislative appropriations could provoke a constitutional crisis because the Governor's authority to shape a budget through vetoes has never been fully defined in the courts, several legal experts said today.</p>
        <p>While many states, including New York, have provisions for "line item" vetoes, in which sections of a budget can be vetoed, many of these only stipulate that a Governor can veto entire appropriations, said Gerald Benjamin, a political science professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz who has studied the history of budget battles between New York's governors and the Legislature.</p>
        <p>A much smaller number of states, New York not among them, provide specific authority for what are known as "reducing item" vetoes, in which a governor simply cuts legislative appropriations. Mr. Cuomo and other governors have asserted that they have such authority, but the matter has never been fully resolved in court, Professor Benjamin said.  A Precaution</p>
        <p>In New York City, officials said they were worried that the chronically elusive budget deal in Albany could fall apart again.</p>
        <p>As a precaution, officials in New York City continued their preparations to borrow $3 billion in the second and third weeks of June, just in case the legislative negotiations fell apart.</p>
        <p>Mayor Dinkins has warned that the city will face a cash flow crisis if it does not receive overdue state aid payments by mid-June. The payments cannot be made until a budget is passed by the Legislature. "We're moving ahead," Mr. Dinkins said today. "Now, if they achieve an accord and money is forthcoming, then fine, then we stop."</p>
        <p>The Mayor said he did not intend to question the Legislature's ability to pass a budget this week. "I don't mean to sound cynical," he said. "I mean to sound realistic."</p>
        <p>Even if the Legislature does pass a budget this week, the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said he questioned whether state aid payments could reach the city fast enough to eliminate a need to borrow altogether.</p>
        <p>It historically has taken at least 12 days, and sometimes as long as three weeks, for the state to make its aid payments to municipal governments once a budget is passed, said Marvin G. Nailor, a spokesman for State Comptroller Edward V. Regan. That time is needed for the Comptroller to certify the budget as balanced and for the state to sell $3.9 billion in short-term notes, a process known as the spring borrowing, though at the rate Albany is progressing, it may end up being called the summer borrowing this year.</p>
        <p>The city might be able to borrow less than $3 billion if its treasury was near depletion but it knew that a state aid payment was on the way, Mr. Michael said. A $3 billion borrowing would cost the city about $19 million in interest, according to city estimates.</p>
        <p>"The borrowing is both risky and expensive for us, so to the extent that we can eliminate it or downsize it, we will," he said.</p>
