        <p>METAL porch railings need regular maintenance. A weak railing is a safety hazard, and a railing needing paint can spoil the appearance of an entire porch or entrance.</p>
        <p>Newer railings are often aluminum. They require little care apart from painting and tightening loose parts. Steel and wrought-iron railings, however, can rust if neglected.</p>
        <p>Frequent cleaning is probably the most important maintenance. To clean painted railings, wash them with a strong solution of household detergent and water. Then rinse. Apply the solution with a cloth, sponge or small bristle scrub brush. To keep brass and other bright metal features shiny, apply a metal polish.</p>
        <p>Instead of commercial polish with its harsh chemicals, brass or copper can be cleaned with a mixture of equal parts distilled white vinegar and table salt. Heat the solution to dissolve the salt. Dip half a lemon into it and use it to rub the metal until it shines. Rinse the metal with plain water. To clean aluminum or chrome, wipe it with a cloth dipped in heated vinegar, then rinse with water.</p>
        <p>In all cases, apply paste or car wax to handrails and polished parts after cleaning. That will inhibit tarnishing.</p>
        <p>Examine railings at least twice a year for loose or damaged fasteners and chipped paint. Try to make repairs as soon as they are noticed.</p>
        <p>Loose railing parts fastened by bolts and screws can usually be tightened with a wrench and screwdriver. If corrosion prevents turning a fastener, spray it with penetrating oil. Most cans come with a plastic tube that can be attached to the nozzle for precise aiming. Wait about half an hour for the oil to work, and then try again.</p>
        <p>Riveted parts may have to be professionally repaired. Railing companies are in telephone guides. You may be able to substitute a short bolt and nut for the broken or missing rivet. To remove a loose rivet, saw the head off with a hacksaw. Then pull the shaft free with pliers or tap it out with a hammer and a large nail.</p>
        <p>Loose fasteners joining railings to masonry cannot generally be retightened. Instead, the fastener and its anchor, the part embedded in the masonry, have to be removed and replaced. Use a wrench to unscrew damaged bolts. To remove nails, use a claw hammer or pry bar.</p>
        <p>Anchors that hold nails usually overlap the outside of the railing's mounting fixture and may come out of the masonry when the nail is withdrawn. If not, they can be pulled out with pliers.</p>
        <p>Anchors holding threaded fasteners are usually covered by the fixture. To remove those, you have to detach the fixture from the masonry by unscrewing all the fasteners holding it. They can be reinstalled, provided the anchors are not loosened in the process.</p>
        <p>Move the railing and fixture out of the way, so the loosened anchor can be pulled from the masonry with pliers. To move the railing, you may have to disassemble the section of it containing the fixture.</p>
        <p>If possible, replace the loosened fastener with a similar one that is either longer or that has a larger diameter. You will probably have to enlarge the hole into which the anchor fits, usually with an electric drill with a carbide-tipped masonry bit the same diameter as the anchor. If a more powerful drill is needed, rent an electric hammer drill.</p>
        <p>If you must use a fastener the same size as the original, clean the anchor hole by blowing out loose particles. Then fill it with epoxy.  Before the adhesive stiffens, perform these steps:</p>
        <p>To install a nail and anchor, reposition the fixture, insert the fastener through it into the epoxy-filled hole and drive the nail into the anchor with a hammer. Scrape away excess epoxy with a putty knife and wipe the masonry clean with a piece of rough cloth dampened with water or muriatic-acid solution for cleaning bricks. Allow the epoxy to cure.</p>
        <p>To install a bolt and anchor, embed the anchor in the hole. Clean the area as described, and allow the epoxy to cure fully, so that screwing in the bolt will not loosen the anchor. Be sure the anchor is correctly aligned before the epoxy hardens. Afterward, reposition the fixture and install the bolt with a wrench.</p>
        <p>To repair a post that has rusted through where it joins the steps, use a hacksaw to cut it completely free. If the stub is embedded in a hole drilled in the step, saw or chisel away any metal protruding above the step, so that the surface is level.</p>
        <p>Purchase a correctly sized slip shoe -- a metal plate with a socket in the center that will accept the end of the trimmed post -- from a railing company. The shoe has holes in the plate for fasteners.</p>
        <p>Fit the shoe onto the post and position it so the post is vertical and the plate covers the hole in the step. Using the holes in the plate as guides, drill new holes into the step for fastener anchors. Install the fasteners to attach the slip shoe to the step.</p>
        <p>If the rusted or damaged post is already fitted with a slip shoe, replace it with a larger new one.</p>
        <p>Painting steel and iron railings is the only way to keep them from rusting. If minor rusting has begun, polish the areas with steel wool to remove all rust. Then apply a rust-resisting primer. To repair serious rusting, scrape away just the loose deposits. Then apply rust converter, which hardens rust, followed by primer. In both cases, cover the primer with high-quality rust-resisting paint.  HOME REPAIR</p>
