        <p>Israel expelled four Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Lebanon early this morning. All four were accused of fomenting and carrying out violent acts on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization .</p>
        <p>"The expulsions were carried out following a Supreme Court denial of their appeals against the orders," the army said.

        <p>Israel expelled four Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Lebanon early this morning. All four were accused of fomenting and carrying out violent acts on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization .</p>
        <p>"The expulsions were carried out following a Supreme Court denial of their appeals against the orders," the army said. The four -- Jamal Yassin Abu-Habel, Muin Mohammed Maslan, Hisham Mohammed Ali Dahalan and Jamal Abed Abu-Jadyan -- were taken by helicopter to southern Lebanon and dropped off to search for a taxi to Beirut.</p>
        <p>The four bring to 69 the number of Palestinians deported since their uprising began in the occupied territories more than 41 months ago.</p>
        <p>The expulsion order against the four was issued on March 24 and the court held the final hearing on their appeal on Tuesday. Under normal circumstances, they would have been expelled the next morning.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was here, meeting with Government leaders as part of his effort to arrange a regional peace conference. The United States has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's policy of expelling people accused of crimes. And so the army apparently decided not to carry out the order until after he had left.</p>
