        <p>About halfway through Deee-lite's packed show at Roseland on Thursday night, the group's lead singer, Lady Miss Kier, said, "The world is ugly," then launched into a short environmental plea. It was the only conventionally articulated verbal moment of the night.</p>
        <p>It wasn't the only articulated moment, though, as the concert was brimming with obvious meaning. The band's cleverness comes in its sensitivity to pop culture; its show arrives loaded with visual and musical paragraphs of explanation. Lady Miss Kier, seemingly obsessed with the way glamour is produced, wore 1960's outfits that looked as if they had been bought from a Las Vegas thrift shop specializing in leftover show outfits.</p>

        <p>About halfway through Deee-lite's packed show at Roseland on Thursday night, the group's lead singer, Lady Miss Kier, said, "The world is ugly," then launched into a short environmental plea. It was the only conventionally articulated verbal moment of the night.</p>
        <p>It wasn't the only articulated moment, though, as the concert was brimming with obvious meaning. The band's cleverness comes in its sensitivity to pop culture; its show arrives loaded with visual and musical paragraphs of explanation. Lady Miss Kier, seemingly obsessed with the way glamour is produced, wore 1960's outfits that looked as if they had been bought from a Las Vegas thrift shop specializing in leftover show outfits.</p>
        <p>She sucked in her cheeks like a model and posed like a mannequin. One of the group's D.J.'s, Jungle D.J. Towa Towa, walked around the stage with a video camera, filming the band and the audience. Dance routines and expressions -- Lady Miss Kier would stare straight ahead as if addressing an imaginary camera -- were lifted from the huge reservoir of pop entertainment, including Las Vegas routines, 60's pop-idol imagery and television dance-party shows.</p>
        <p>The music, supplied by tape and by a band that included a trio from the Parliament-Funkadelic constellation -- Bootsy Collins on bass, Roger Parker on drums and Michael Hampton on guitar -- did not keep up with the stage show. At times the sound turned murky, and the musicians, who are used to tearing up a live performance, seemed inhibited by the pop necessity of reproducing the music on a recording.</p>
        <p>Still, music wasn't so much the point. Lady Miss Kier is one of the more giving performers on the pop circuit, someone who has managed to make a carefully constructed, stylish persona and yet not emphasize the gap between performer and audience. Her outfits, representing the new, retro style of glamour, argue for the ready-made: style hasn't yet turned into fashion. Although the audience seemed more restrained than the band's usual audience, people were there to enjoy themselves and to dance, and they did.</p>
