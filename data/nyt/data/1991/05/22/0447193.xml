        <p>Fortune may be full of fresh variety, but at Yale University it often comes with the same name: Bass.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, for the fourth time in less than a year, a member of the Bass family of Fort Worth gave Yale a gift of $20 million.</p>
        <p>The latest gift was made by the patriarch of the Bass family, Perry Richardson Bass, 76 years old, who graduated from Yale in 1937 with a degree in geology and who worked in the family's oil business.</p>
        <p>The money will be used to build the Perry R. Bass Center for Molecular and Structural Biology, a 99,000-square-foot building on Yale's Science Hill that is expected to be completed by 1993.</p>
        <p>It will house classrooms and a biophysics and biochemistry laboratory where research will be done on genetics and the role of proteins in causing AIDS, cancer and other diseases.</p>
        <p>MAccompanied by his wife, Nancy Lee, Mr. Bass made a rare public appearance at the Yale campus to announce the gift. In the past, Bass family members have not always been present when their large gifts were made public.</p>
        <p>"I owe this great university an enormous debt of gratitude," Mr. Bass said in a written statement.</p>
        <p>"Fulfilling our society's demands for new scientific information about human diseases," he continued, "requires a synergistic approach, a pooling of intellectual resources that draws upon Yale's considerable strengths."</p>
        <p>The new laboratory will focus on a process called X-ray crystallography, which produces three-dimensional computer images of protein molecules. Such information helps scientists to understand how diseases like AIDS and cancer attack the body and to design more effective medications for fighting them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bass is chairman and director of the Bass Enterprises Production Company and of the Sid Richardson Carbon and Gasoline Company.</p>
        <p>In the past year, three of Mr. Bass's four sons have each donated $20 million to Yale, from which all four sons graduated.</p>
        <p>Last May, Edward P. Bass, Class of '68, established the Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies with his gift. In October, Sid R. Bass, Class of '65, gave $20 million to support teaching and research in the humanities. On April 17, Lee M. Bass, Class of '79, endowed 11 professorships in the study of Western civilization.</p>
        <p>A fourth son, Robert M. Bass, graduated from Yale in 1971.</p>
