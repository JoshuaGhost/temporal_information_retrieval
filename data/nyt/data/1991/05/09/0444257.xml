        <p>MITSUBISHI, the auto maker whose name means "three diamonds" in Japanese, is leaving no gemstone unturned in image-laden advertising for an important new model.</p>
        <p>The ads are for the 1992 Diamante (Spanish for "diamond") being introduced by Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. The sedan, priced from $22,000 to $28,000, is heading into a market segment more crowded than a millionaire's garage: luxury models aimed at affluent, well-educated buyers.</p>
        <p>"This is Mitsubishi's first foray into a niche that's probably the hottest in the car business," said David Stickles, senior vice president and group creative director at Grey Advertising Inc., New York, Mitsubishi's agency. "To make a leap into the luxury arena is no small task."</p>
        <p>That is why Grey's strategy is "to waste no time in establishing Diamante as a luxury make," Mr. Stickles said. Though Grey and Mitsubishi Motor Sales, the American subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, declined to discuss the initial budget, estimates range from $30 million to $40 million, a significant chunk of the roughly $120 million that Grey is likely to spend this year buying ads for Mitsubishi, its largest client.</p>
        <p>A first look at the television commercials, which will begin on Sunday, and print ads, to run in June issues of magazines from Car and Driver to Architectural Digest, reveals that their primary selling point is the heritage of Mitsubishi and the celebration next year of its 75th -- yes, diamond -- anniversary. (Add another diamond reference to the list: Mitsubishi's corporate logo, prominently displayed in the ads, is a trio of diamonds.)</p>
        <p>The ads' diamond-drenched imagery includes references to Diamante as "a new luxury performance sedan that is brilliant in every facet," as well as a hush-voiced announcer who comments in one commercial: "For 75 years, Mitsubishi Motors' diamond emblem has symbolized its unbending standard of quality. Introducing the highest expression of that standard, the Diamante."</p>
        <p>"We did some research early on that showed when people are more aware of the history of our company, they had more confidence in our product," said Frances Oda, Mitsubishi's advertising director, based in Cypress, Calif.</p>
        <p>In addition to the diamond images, the ads present Diamante as a hybrid, combining Japanese technology with what Mr. Stickles termed "a decidedly European flair" in styling and handling. The car is seen in sun-dappled, European-looking settings, riding through rolling hills or parked on cobblestone streets, all of which were actually on a California backlot.</p>
        <p>"We did not want to go the route of Infiniti and create an aura of Japanese-ness," Mr. Stickles said, referring to the Zen-like introductory campaign for the Nissan luxury car, especially since Diamante has a "BMW look."</p>
        <p>Not only must Diamante quickly establish itself against recently arrived Japanese-built makes like Infiniti, Honda's Acura and Toyota's Lexus, it faces fierce competition from long-established, European-built lines like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. And as if that were not challenging enough, the introduction comes as the American auto market has sunk into a deep sales slump.</p>
        <p>The ads' effort to link Diamante to Mitsubishi is particularly important because, unlike Honda, Toyota and Nissan, Mitsubishi is introducing its luxury model under its own name instead of that of a newly formed division.</p>
        <p>One significant reason for that is the auto maker's desire to create a "halo effect from a luxury car to positively affect the Mitsubishi brand," Mr. Stickles said, which Grey's advertising has positioned to this point as offering "good, value-oriented sedans and exotic sports cars."</p>
        <p>Rolling out Diamante under the Mitsubishi name also means that ad spending can be less than competitors spent. The estimated initial budget compares with the $60 million Nissan spent to introduce Infiniti and the $70 million Toyota spent for Lexus.</p>
