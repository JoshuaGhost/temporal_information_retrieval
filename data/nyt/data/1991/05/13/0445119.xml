        <p>Nothing has attracted greater attention -- and controversy -- to the early-music movement than its forays into standard orchestral repertory. Creeping closer and closer to the present and thereby crowding the turf of conventional orchestras, Roger Norrington brought an all-Brahms program to Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>True, the ensemble was not an original-instruments band but the Orchestra of St. Luke's; this was his second concert as its titular music director, following a more conventional Haydn-Mozart-Beethoven outing in December. Yet Mr. Norrington still applied period stylistic practices to the modern instruments, all explained in one of his characteristic, informative program notes. Smaller forces were employed, pitch slightly lowered, violins divided, the musicians placed on risers and the phrasing modified in subtle but attention-getting ways.</p>

        <p>Nothing has attracted greater attention -- and controversy -- to the early-music movement than its forays into standard orchestral repertory. Creeping closer and closer to the present and thereby crowding the turf of conventional orchestras, Roger Norrington brought an all-Brahms program to Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>True, the ensemble was not an original-instruments band but the Orchestra of St. Luke's; this was his second concert as its titular music director, following a more conventional Haydn-Mozart-Beethoven outing in December. Yet Mr. Norrington still applied period stylistic practices to the modern instruments, all explained in one of his characteristic, informative program notes. Smaller forces were employed, pitch slightly lowered, violins divided, the musicians placed on risers and the phrasing modified in subtle but attention-getting ways.</p>
        <p>The results were enlivening, appealing yet not entirely convincing, if convincing means sweeping all past interpretations aside. Mr. Norrington had cleverly arranged the program as a mini-drama, from the heroic despair of the "Tragic" Overture to the agonizing doubt and ultimate triumph of the "Rinaldo" cantata to the sunnier ebullience of the Second Symphony. The inclusion of the rarely heard "Rinaldo" also made for a nice balance between familiar and unfamiliar.</p>
        <p>As usual with Mr. Norrington, the tempos tended toward the very fast and the very slow. What was not so usual was both extremes within the same piece, as in the overture, which shot off like a rocket and then slowed to near somnolence. These transitions were sometimes accomplished abruptly but employed a greater degree of rubato, or subtle adjustment of tempo, than has been the case in this conductor's more rigidly propulsive Classical performances.</p>
        <p>Balances, too, were unusual compared with those of a big, modern orchestra. The use of a 60-player ensemble meant more prominence for the winds and brass, along with a dark string sound that dimmed brilliance but underscored intensity.</p>
        <p>The largest area of controversy lay in the use of portamento, or the almost giddy swooping from note to note common on century-old recordings. In his program note, Mr. Norrington argued that portamento, like rubato, was intended by Brahms as a judiciously applied expressive device, not something lathered on indiscriminately. One might have preferred a little more lathering, but perhaps he does that with original instruments.</p>
        <p>As a longtime choral conductor, Mr. Norrington reveled in "Rinaldo," as did the men of the New York Choral Artists and the tenor Jerry Hadley as the somewhat stentorian protagonist. This quasi-operatic setting of a Goethe poem about a crusader struggling to break the bonds of enchantment has a fustian earnestness that has limited its popularity, but it was good to hear it.</p>
        <p>The symphony went very well, especially the fleet scherzo and the exhilarating finale. Mr. Norrington lacks the concern for niceties of orchestral execution that elevate the best modern performances. But his phrasing was often passionate and persuasive, and the entire evening a vindication of the bolder presumptions of the historical performance movement.</p>
