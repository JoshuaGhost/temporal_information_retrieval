        <p>Sam Perkins scored 27 points and the Los Angeles Lakers moved within one victory of reaching the Western Conference finals for the ninth time in 10 years with a 123-107 victory over the Golden State Warriors this afternoon.</p>
        <p>The Lakers used a 16-3 spurt, including 11 consecutive points, early in the fourth quarter to shake free of the Warriors and open a three-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series. Game 5 is scheduled for Tuesday night in Inglewood, Calif.</p>
        <p>Byron Scott and Magic Johnson each scored 21 points, and the Lakers made 36 of 47 free throws as the Warriors committed 34 fouls against their bigger opponents. Mullin Is Held Down</p>
        <p>Johnson had 11 assists and Scott grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds as Los Angeles swept the two games in Oakland. The Lakers missed the conference finals in 1990 -- for the first time since 1981 -- when they were upset by Phoenix in the second round.</p>
        <p>Mitch Richmond scored 26 points, Tim Hardaway 22 and Sarunas Marciulionis 20 for Golden State. Marciulionis fouled out early in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Chris Mullin stayed in a slump for the Warriors, going scoreless in the first half and finishing with 9 points on 4-for-13 shooting. Since scoring 41 points in Game 2, Mullin is 8 for 27 with 22 points.</p>
        <p>It was the first game Mullin failed to reach double figures since March 25, 1989.</p>
        <p>With the decisive 16-3 spurt, the Lakers extended a 91-85 lead into a 107-88 advantage with 7:39 remaining. Scott and James Worthy each scored 4 points in the run before Johnson capped it with a 3-pointer.</p>
        <p>Golden State got no closer than the final score after that.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles led by 10 points three times before Golden State closed to 89-83 on Richmond's runner with 1.3 seconds left in the third period.</p>
        <p>Scott's rebound tip-in made it 71-61 with 8:37 left, and Worthy's 3-pointer finished a 7-0 run that made it 82-72 with 3:24 left. Larry Drew's 3-pointer with 54.2 seconds left put Los Angeles ahead, 89-79.</p>
        <p>The Lakers led, 61-56, at the half by making 21 of 25 free throws as the Warriors committed 18 first-half fouls. Los Angeles also held Mullin to 0-for-6 shooting with two turnovers.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles erased a 54-48 deficit by finishing off the second quarter with a 13-2 run capped by Scott's 3-pointer with 16.6 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 34-24, the Warriors reeled off a 22-4 spurt, taking a 46-38 lead on Jim Petersen's 8-foot baseline jumper with 5:48 left in the half. Marciulionis keyed the run with 10 points, going 5 for 5 with a rebound, an assist, a steal and forcing one jump.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles went ahead, 34-24, with an 11-2 run capped by Johnson's 3-point play with 3.3 seconds left in the first quarter.</p>
