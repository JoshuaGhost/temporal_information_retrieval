        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Beginning with Donald Kagan's speech to the Yale class of 1994, the question of curriculum change has been, for me, one of the most troublesome. The May 4 Op-Ed articles by Henry Louis Gates Jr. ("It's Not Just Anglo-Saxon") and Dean Kagan ("Western Values Are Central") do little to clarify the issue.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Mr. Kagan desires to re-emphasize the study of Western civilization. Conversely, Mr. Gates prefers a curriculum of "multiculturalism." It is unclear, however, how either of them would implement changes in curriculums. Indeed, the complete absence of specifics in the articles seems to have only further blurred an undefined debate.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Beginning with Donald Kagan's speech to the Yale class of 1994, the question of curriculum change has been, for me, one of the most troublesome. The May 4 Op-Ed articles by Henry Louis Gates Jr. ("It's Not Just Anglo-Saxon") and Dean Kagan ("Western Values Are Central") do little to clarify the issue.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Mr. Kagan desires to re-emphasize the study of Western civilization. Conversely, Mr. Gates prefers a curriculum of "multiculturalism." It is unclear, however, how either of them would implement changes in curriculums. Indeed, the complete absence of specifics in the articles seems to have only further blurred an undefined debate.</p>
        <p>Within this vague rhetoric, the curriculum wars have taken on an increasingly polarized character, with the participants moving even further to the right and left. Missing from the debate is the reality that the study of Western civilization and multiculturalism are not mutually exclusive. For years, undergraduates have concentrated in specific areas of Western civilization ranging from the social sciences to the humanities and even the natural sciences.</p>
        <p>Today, the opportunity exists to concentrate in new fields of study, through courses in departments such as African-American and women's studies. A true understanding of Western civilization demands an understanding of the roles of race and gender. These fields of concentration must be strengthened by redoubled support by university administrations. Furthermore, the traditional fields of study must continue to revise their own curriculums to acknowledge the often ignored roles of race and gender.</p>
        <p>Within the recently endowed Western civilization program at Yale, there are provisions to insure the inclusion of the study of minority groups. This appears to be an important step in the right direction. It must be recognized that these provisions do not detract from the study of Western civilization. Rather, they enhance our ability to understand, and perhaps mend, an increasingly fractured society. JOHN F. WITT New Haven, May 5, 1991 The writer is a member of the Yale University class of 1994.</p>
