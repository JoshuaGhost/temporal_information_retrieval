        <p>Walter Hirshon, a retired stockbroker, died on Sunday at his home in Sands Point, L.I. He was 84 years old.</p>
        <p>He died of kidney failure, his daughter Joy Briggs said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirshon started his career on Wall Street in 1927 after graduating from Princeton University. He became an independent broker on the New York Stock Exchange in 1930 and, with the exception of several years with Army Air Corps intelligence in World War II, he was with Hirshon &amp; Company until 1957. He then co-founded Hirshon, Roth &amp; Company. He retired in 1982.</p>
        <p>In addition to his daughter Joy Briggs of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, the former Helen Gross; another daughter, Wendy Morse of Northridge, Calif.; two stepsons, John Raiss of Los Angeles and James Raiss of Philadelphia; a stepdaughter, Linda Dodd of Bronxville, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</p>
