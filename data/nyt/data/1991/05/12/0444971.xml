        <p>The Kingdom of Nepal, its powerful monarchy trimmed by a new Constitution, will hold its first fully democratic election in more than 30 years on Sunday.</p>
        <p>In the competiton are royalists on the right, the centrist party that won the last election in 1959, and Communists and other leftists who proclaim Marxist-Leninism as a creed for the future, not a spent force from the past.</p>
        <p>"We are absolutely confident," says Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a strong Communist candidate in Katmandu and an articulate theoretician of the left.</p>
        <p>Political analysts are guarded in predicting the outcome of the voting, saying that it is hard to gauge the preferences of millions of people spread over the rough but beautiful terrain of this kingdom at the top of the world. A coalition government seems likely, many say.</p>
        <p>Nepalis will be electing a new, 205-member House of Representatives, which is in turn to elect a Prime Minister. The election comes a little over a year after a democracy movement took to the streets of this Himalayan capital, demanding an opening of the political system.</p>
        <p>Leftists were at the forefront of that movement. They had been organizing underground for more than two decades. Over the last year, they have co-existed in careful coalition with the centrist Nepali Congress Party of the interim Prime Minister, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, biding their time as Mr. Bhattarai builds a congenial relationship with King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.</p>
        <p>The strongly anti-monarchial left has now made this an issue.</p>
        <p>"The people wanted change," Mr. Tuladhar said in an interview at his home here. "The people are complaining that although democracy is here, the villagers see no change in administration and administrator. Still seeking the fruits of upheaval that gripped the nation, the commoners sided with the left in this campaign."</p>
        <p>The Communists, though split into factions, drew the biggest crowds to rallies that ended Thursday, especially in urban areas of the Katmandu Valley. Neutral political analysts say that many new voters in the 18-to-21-year-old range are attracted by the left's promises of quick improvement in their lives. Nepal, with a population now estimated at about 18.9 million, is one of the poorest countries on earth.</p>
        <p>Since the abolition of multi-party democracy in 1960 by King Mahendra, the father of the present king, Nepal has been governed under a pyramid of councils called panchayats, whose members were prohibited from seeking election under party affiliations.</p>
        <p>Last spring, after a series of protests that left about 45 people dead -- a far lower figure than the estimates of hundreds of victims that appeared in news reports a year ago -- the panchayat system was abolished and a new constitution written. The King accepted it, and was restored in large measure in the affections of Nepalis, who revere him as their spiritual head. Statement by King</p>
        <p>King Birendra, who has skillfully reduced his public role and that of his Queen in the last year, wished his country well in a statement on Thursday.</p>
        <p>"I am hopeful that all voters will give full consideration to the best interests of Nepal and the Nepalis," he said, "and will cast their votes on mature reflection of how best to strengthen and consolidate the democratic process."</p>
