        <p>New York City and State suffer deep and inseparable fiscal problems that will not be solved by an economic recovery, and should agree on a multiyear plan to shift tax burdens from the city to the state, shrink their work forces and improve management, a major civic group said yesterday.</p>

        <p>New York City and State suffer deep and inseparable fiscal problems that will not be solved by an economic recovery, and should agree on a multiyear plan to shift tax burdens from the city to the state, shrink their work forces and improve management, a major civic group said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The report by the Citizens Budget Commission puts it at least partly at odds with Mayor David N. Dinkins, who endorses shifting some of the city's burdens to the state and streamlining government but contends that the city's problems are mostly the result of a cyclical recession that will pass.</p>
        <p>The commission, a nonprofit watchdog group financed by businesses and for more than half a century a leading Cassandra on local fiscal issues, said the city and the state could face combined deficits totaling $30 billion over the next four years and must begin phasing in fundamental but politically difficult changes.</p>
        <p>In making the recommendations, the budget commission, whose chairman is Richard Ravitch, the former mayoral candidate who was chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, sums up and expands on a chorus of warnings that New York's problems are so deep and likely to persist as to require a rethinking of state and local governments' mission.</p>
        <p>"I think this is an opportunity to deal with this on a long-term basis," he said. "People need certainty and reasonable predictability to make economic decisions. And it's very damaging to have us lurch from crisis to crisis."  Sharing the Costs</p>
        <p>Many of the changes recommended by the commission have been batted around unsuccessfully for years. They include the state's assuming a greater share of the cost of Medicaid and welfare payments, better management of health care for the poor and reshaping employee health benefits, a smaller, more efficient work force in which government could share savings from increased productivity with workers, and higher state income and gasoline taxes to help pay Medicaid and welfare costs and allow reductions in local taxes.</p>
        <p>Only in exchange for such major changes, the group's leaders said, should the city and state move to borrow their way out of their current troubles through various proposals now under review to stretch out the problem by refinancing bonds, for example.</p>
        <p>The commission's president, Raymond D. Horton, said: "What we're sort of looking for is some sort of compact with all the players. What I'm really afraid of now is that we're getting awfully close to treating this problem very much like we treated the 1975 crisis as just a financing problem."</p>
        <p>Mayor Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have said they hope the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up to borrow money on the city's behalf in the 1970's, could now help it with several hundred million dollars from bond refinancings in the coming year.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in a WNYC radio interview, Mr. Cuomo said the assistance corporation might be able to provide more than $1 billion over the next several years if it could do so without damaging its credit ratings. The corporation's chairman, Felix G. Rohatyn, says he could only provide such help on those conditions and as part of a comprehensive plan.</p>
        <p>The budget commission, too, has resisted the idea of borrowing to help close the deficit, and its report seemed aimed at buttressing Mr. Rohatyn's views in the face of heavy political pressure to use the money for this.</p>
        <p>Of the study, Mr. Cuomo said in Albany: "We're trying to deal with imminent catastrophe in New York City between now and May 25. The Citizens Budget Commission's ideas for the future may be worthwhile. For the moment the important question is how to get the Legislature to produce a budget within the next 10 days or so, and that's what I'm concentrating on."</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, Eli Attie, said, "Obviously we're very pleased that the Citizens Budget Commission has embraced a number of proposals we have already made," like having the state bear a bigger share of Medicaid costs. "We hope the C.B.C. will use whatever authority it has to help achieve these goals. At the same time, it's important to recognize that achieving these kinds of reforms isn't as easy as issuing a report or snapping your fingers."</p>
        <p>"I think there is no question," Mr. Rohatyn said, "that ultimately there has to be a city-state restructuring of functions and financing."</p>
        <p>"This obviously can't be done overnight," he added, "and I think the only way to do it will be for some legislatively created type of commission to make recommendations to the Legislature and to have it voted up or down."</p>
