        <p>President Bush's mother, DOROTHY WALKER BUSH, is taking her son's 1988 campaign promise of no new taxes seriously. She is challenging the latest assessment and tax bill for her property in Jupiter Island, Fla., The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush, who is 90 years old, filed a petition this week challenging the Martin County property appraiser's $682,320 assessment of her Jupiter Island winter home, maintaining that it is $173,000 too high.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush paid $11,840 in taxes this year on the two-bedroom, two-bath house with swmming pool. Her taxes would increase by about $2,400 under the new assessment.</p>
        <p>"Her taxes have gotten too high and the valuation of the property has gotten too high," said her brother, JAMES WALKER, who has also filed a protest about the valuation of his home on Jupiter Island.</p>
        <p>BOB PHILLIPS, the Martin County property appraiser, said he did not yet know about specific protests. "I have three people going through them now, but last year there were 95 cases heard by the value adjustment board here, and we won all 95."</p>
