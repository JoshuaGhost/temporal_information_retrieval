        <p>In a forceful display of independence that reflects its new powers, the New York City Council yesterday unanimously overrode Mayor David N. Dinkins's veto of a bill requiring price stickers on supermarket items.</p>
        <p>Although the item-pricing bill was by no means a watershed piece of legislation, the Council's 32-to-0 vote was a symbolic victory for the Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, that signaled his determination to forge the Council into a legislative body that will be an equal partner in governing the city.</p>
        <p>In vetoing the bill, the Mayor had said that the fines were not stiff enough to bring about a supermarket's compliance.</p>
        <p>Votes to override vetoes have been rare, with only four in the last 20 years, all coming at times when the mayor was a lame duck. Yesterday was the first time a veto by Mr. Dinkins has been overturned.</p>
        <p>"It's a question of institutional integrity," Mr. Vallone said just before the vote. "The independence and the integrity of the Council process is at stake."  Fines Called Too Low</p>
        <p>A state law on item pricing expired in June after the State Senate refused to extend it. In mid-July, Councilwoman Carole Greitzer and the Consumer Affairs Commisioner, Mark Green, announced plans to craft a law to fill the gap.</p>
        <p>But the bill passed by the full Council did not include everything the Dinkins administration wanted, and on Sept. 13 the Mayor refused to sign it, saying the fines it specified were too low and the enforcement procedures too cumbersome. The bill provided a maximum fine of $1,000 for first-time violations and $4,000 for subsequent violations. It required large grocery stores to put prices on most individual items so that consumers could catch errors by cashiers and laser scanners. Some sales items and a handful of special products like baby food and frozen foods were exempt.</p>
        <p>The two months of political bickering leading to the showdown vote yesterday also demonstrated the lack of communication between the Mayor and the Council's leadership. The Mayor and the Speaker both accused each other of refusing to talk about a compromise. Aides in both camps said the two men never spoke directly to each other about the bill. Instead the Mayor sent a letter threatening to veto the measure an hour before it was passed on Aug. 14, piquing Mr. Vallone, who until that point had not championed the measure. The Mayor's letter was seen as a threat to the Council's independence and galvanized support for the bill, which passed unanimously, Mr. Vallone said.</p>
        <p>"I just don't understand the real reason for the veto," Mr. Vallone said. "In some ways it reminds me of a fellow taking his ball and saying I'm going to go home now because you're not playing by my rules. But right now the ball is in our court."</p>
        <p>Ms. Greitzer and other Council members charged that the Mayor had cynically vetoed the bill, which includeshigher penalties than the state law it was meant to replace. Pointing out that Mr. Dinkins lobbied for the state version of the law that failed to pass the State Senate, they charged that the Mayor rejected the Council's bill solely to appear pure on the issue of consumer protection.</p>
        <p>But the Mayor's lobbyists insist that Mr. Dinkins sincerely believes the bill is a watered-down version of the measure his administration proposed in July.</p>
        <p>"The Council wants to have a legislative victory and the way it wants to get a legislative victory is to hurt consumers," Mr. Dinkins's spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Mayor blamed Ms. Greitzer and Mr. Vallone for the impasse, saying they had refused to negotiate. He also rejected an argument from lobbyists for civic groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group that it was better to pass a bill that later could be amended than to leave consumers unprotected.</p>
        <p>"I think it's no answer to say that this is better than no bill at all, because the options didn't have to be this or no bill at all," Mr. Dinkins said. "The leadership of the Council refused to discuss this so that we might come to some compromise."</p>
