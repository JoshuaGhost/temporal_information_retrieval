        <p>One judge has had her say. Now KEVIN BUTLER is waiting to see if the other ax will fall. Butler, the Chicago Bears' kicker, was fined $1,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service on Friday after he pleaded guilty to a drunk driving charge stemming from an Aug. 6 arrest in suburban Lincolnshire, Ill. Judge BARBARA GILLERAN-JOHNSON, who passed sentence in Lake County Circuit Court in Waukehan, also ordered Butler to take a drivers' education and counseling course, something his lawyer said Butler had already done.</p>
        <p>Next to be heard from is Commissioner PAUL TAGLIABUE, who will decide whether to suspend Butler up to four games, as the National Football League rules allow, as a result of the conviction. (AP)</p>
