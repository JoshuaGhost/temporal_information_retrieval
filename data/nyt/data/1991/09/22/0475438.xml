        <p>A marathon of social events began on Thursday at Wave Hill, a gem of botanical charm on the banks of the Hudson River in Riverdale in the Bronx. Guests carried umbrellas to a picnic supper and plant sale that benefited the John Nally Horticultural Apprenticeships.</p>
        <p>Later on Thursday, 700 guests led by Brooke Astor walked through a rain-soaked tent to climb aboard the New Yorker, a yacht tied up for the evening on the East River at 70th Street opposite the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The evening of dining and dancing raised funds for the hospital. Also on Thursday, Princess Stephanie and Prince Albert of Monaco were hosts at the Princess Grace Foundation-U.S.A. Junior Endowment Benefit at Country Club, a new supper club on East 85th Street. The party benefited young artists in American theater, dance and film.</p>

        <p>On Monday, the roses in the new Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx were doing their best to survive the heat. So were the guests who arrived for cocktails in the garden at twilight. Dinner followed in an adjoining tent. Proceeds support the garden. Emily Frick was the chairwoman.</p>
        <p>At the Central Park Zoo on Monday, Howard Phipps Jr., president of the New York Zoological Society, was the host at a dinner at which the society's Distinguished Leadership Award was presented to United States Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, and Rand V. Araskog, chairman of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Still later, guests jammed into Saks Fifth Avenue's first floor, along with a host of circus entertainers, an impersonator of Queen Elizabeth and the real Patti LaBelle. It was all to introduce Moschino, the new perfume of the Italian designer Franco Moschino.</p>
