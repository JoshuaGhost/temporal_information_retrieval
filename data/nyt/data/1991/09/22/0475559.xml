        <p>THE State Museum is reinstalling its collection, and the drawing shown here, Bill Traylor's "Brown Spotted Dog," is one of the many works on display. It dates from circa 1940 and is a fairly recent acquisition.</p>
        <p>This is a young collection, but the museum, or rather the acorn from which it grew, dates to 1832. This was the year that the mineral samples gathered by surveyors for the Morris Canal were deposited at the State House, forming the nucleus of a natural sciences collection.</p>
        <p>At that time there was canal fever. Since the 1820's or earlier, plans for a hundred of them had been under consideration, and in the business of hauling coal from Pennsylvania, the Morris, now the subject of an exhibition at the Macculloch Hall Historical Museum in Morristown, had to compete with the Delaware and Raritan.</p>
        <p>Getting back to the minerals: the specimens multiplied, and after being shown in the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876, they were left on view in their State House quarters, which later were chartered as the Museum of Geological Survey. In 1895, Silas Morse was appointed curator in order to facilitate a display at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Seventy years, one curator and two directors later, the museum had a new name, a building of its own and the start of a collection that included fine and decorative arts as well as the original minerals.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, most of the art now on view was acquired under the administration of Leah Sloshberg, director since 1971, and her curator for 23 years, Zoltan Buki. Providing that the visitor does not expect too much -- that is, first-rate examples of everything that has happened in American art -- this display can be pretty rewarding, not least because of its pleasing juxtapositions.</p>
        <p>On the second floor, where the 19th and 20th centuries conjoin, there hangs among the furniture Ralph Blakelock's "Sunset," painted late, but before 1916. Were it not for the texture, which is as nubbly as old paint on a tenement wall, this landscape would qualify as Luminism. Yet it acts as a bridge between Asher B. Durand's diaphanous "Scene Among the Berkshires" (1879) and Childe Hassam's 1919 study of a shingled house in East Hampton.</p>
        <p>This picture is as busy and impacted as any by Hassam's coeval, Maurice Prendergast, and it contrasts spectacularly with his wispy scene of bookstores along a pale green Seine, done some 20 years earlier. Equally wispy but more Whistlerian is John Twachtman's small view of houses and trees in winter, where the grays are touched with a similar green.</p>
        <p>Albert Gallatin was a pioneer in the collecting of Modernism -- his Gallery of Living Art opened in 1927 (at New York University) -- and he was himself a Modernist. Later, it was said of his holdings that they "presented the tendency without the quality of modern art," but the criticism is more applicable to his own work.</p>
        <p>The abstraction here is an arrangement of two trapezoids and a few smaller shapes painted flatly in too many colors -- earth tones with passages of pink, orange, viridian and cobalt. Nevertheless, this 1951 canvas puts the artist closer to the Minimalism that followed Abstract Expressionism than to the geometric abstraction that preceded it.</p>
        <p>Also present are Charles Biederman, Ilya Bolotowsky, John Ferren, George L. K. Morris and Charles Shaw, all of whom were espoused by Gallatin. Incidentally, the government official who recommended that the Delaware and Raritan Canal be built was also named Albert Gallatin. It's a small world.</p>
        <p>On the whole, the memorable pieces are those that are more or less representational, beginning with Arthur Dove's wonderful "After the Storm" (1922), where a bisected sun at the top looks down on gray shapes that could be clouds or mountains. It hangs near Georgia O'Keeffe's view of the East River from high up in the Shelton Hotel, in which the sun, again dead center, casts white light on red and blue water, turning the buildings on either side into silhouettes of black and pearly gray.</p>
        <p>Then comes a transition showing how unsmooth has been the course of postwar American art. It begins with a tumultuously impastoed piece of Abstract Expressionism by Al Leslie and continues through Larry Rivers's face of a man with features labeled in French and Fairfield Porter's impressionistic portrait of the young Lizzie, standing with an unfortunate red cloche on her head. The climax comes with images by two of America's chilliest contemporaries, Philip Pearlstein and Neil Welliver. The Pearlstein is of a nude woman looking exquisitely uncomfortable bunched up in a hammock; the Welliver is a view of a sky as glowing as Blakelock's seen through a thicket. This trip begins in 1955 and ends in 1984.</p>
        <p>Artists who are cool but sympathetic include Catherine Murphy, with an early scene of backyards, and Cynthia Mailman with an exercise in near-perfection. It is a view of flat lavender-blue water between flat sandy banks and what appears to be the Pulaski Skyway in the background.</p>
        <p>But for every work mentioned, there are a dozen that should be, including Archipenko's "Cycladic" nude, carved in white marble, and Anne Ryan's collage of fragile fabric squares, adjacent to Gertrude Greene's burlier, more biomorphic composition in brown and gray papers. There is art from natives of New Jersey -- the thickly painted seascape, by John Marin -- and from those adopted by the state -- the posterlike scenes of Paterson by Oscar Bluemner. "Zeppelin in Flames Over New Jersey," by Eilshemius, a native of Kearny, is not on display, more's the pity.</p>
        <p>All this remains on view indefinitely. Hours are 9 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday. The museum is at 205 West State Street.  ART</p>
