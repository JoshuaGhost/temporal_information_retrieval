        <p>As part of its quincentennial celebrations, the Bahamas has introduced a discount card that offers discounts at more than 100 shops, restaurants and attractions for American vacationers. The blue and yellow Bahamas Treasure Card, which looks like a credit card and carries the islands' quincentennial logo, brings discounts of up to 50 percent at participating merchants on New Providence, which includes Nassau, and Grand Bahama, including Freeport, as well as several other islands.  The program will run through Jan. 31, 1993.</p>
        <p>Travel agents can supply the card to their customers, or cards can be picked up at Bahamian airport or casino-hotels in Nassau or Freeport. With the card, travelers also receive a brochure listing participants. More information: the Bahamas Tourist Office, (800) 627-7281.</p>
