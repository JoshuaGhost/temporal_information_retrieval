        <p>FIVE years ago, Muller-Catoir, an obscure winery with obscure vineyards growing obscure grapes in this obscure village in an obscure corner of the Rhineland-Palatinate, exported 2 percent of its production to the United States and Britain.</p>
        <p>Today, Muller-Catoir glows in the pantheon of Germany's wineries; the demand for its wines has skyrocketed and last year it exported 20 percent to America and Britain.</p>
        <p>The person behind this ascent is Hans-Gunter Schwarz, a man whom the authoritative Stuart Pigott, a British wine writer living in Germany, calls "one of the best makers of dry white wines anywhere in the world."</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz's international reputation and Muller-Catoir's overseas career were born after Terry Theise, a young Washington importer specializing in small German producers, noticed a citation in a book. He coaxed 50 cases from Heinrich Catoir, the owner. "It took three visits to persuade him to export," Mr. Theise said. "I twisted his arm." Until then, Mr. Catoir sold only to German mail-order and drive-up customers; even today, few German restaurants are offered the wines.</p>
        <p>The influential critic Robert M. Parker Jr. rated some of these wines in the 90-bracket of his 100-point scale in 1989, pronouncing Mr. Schwarz "Germany's most brilliant winemaker," and a star was born</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz, a modest, sweet-natured, soft-spoken, publicity-shy man of 50 years who pads around in sandals, seems stunned by the celebrity spotlight, the surge of visitors and Americans' nonstop technical questions about pH's and tannin -- subjects that don't quicken the pulses of German consumers.</p>
        <p>"I'm not a commercial man, just an earthbound planter and cellar person," he said, with "a weakness for difficult grapes -- the ones that ask the most of me."</p>
        <p>They are the seldom seen rieslaner and muskateller, which are "very sensitive to soil and susceptible to rot, to atmospheric changes," he said. There is the more widely planted, hardier scheurebe (pronounced SHOY-ray-buh), which when underripe yields thin, acidic wine but when superripe makes lush blackcurrant-like semidry and sweet dessert wine.</p>
        <p>And if elevating those minor grapes to major league wine status is not enough, in a country not known for red wine he is defining a luminously fruity Palatinate style of pinot noir that shuns Burgundian earthiness.</p>
        <p>"His pinot noir has tremendous depth of flavor, strength and complexity," said Rainer Lingenfelder, whose pinot noir, made at Weingut K. &amp; H. Lingenfelder in Grosskarlbach, has earned praise.</p>
        <p>"Herr Schwarz is Mr. Wine to younger German winemakers, especially here in the Rheinpfalz," said the 35-year-old Mr. Lingenfelder, using the German name for the region. "He has always trained apprentices. His ideas have spread. Serious people in the industry respect all the medals and trophies he has won."</p>
        <p>In a world obsessed by chardonnay, except in Germany where that grape is virtually homeless, Mr. Schwarz disparages it as a pretender to the throne occupied by riesling, his favorite white-wine grape. And at a time when cellarmasters-as-magicians do everything but turn wine inside out, he is a hands-off winegrower.</p>
        <p>He concedes that he talks to the fruit in Weingut Muller-Catoir's organic hillside vineyards during his usual 75-hour workweek; after the harvest, he parentally coaxes the wine to display its ideal scents and flavors.</p>
        <p>Today's fad word in German winespeak is "reductive." For Mr. Schwarz, it means keeping white wine out of oak casks and in stainless steel so that oxygen cannot reduce its zesty fruitiness. He uses natural yeast for fermentation, because commercial yeast can alter wine's traits. He pumps and filters wine just once to separate it from the dead yeast after alcoholic fermentation. In short, to let the wine be itself, he shuns such technical processes as centrifuging, deacidifying or fining to clarify the wine. He adds just enough sulfur to bar spoilage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz said he has believed in such minimalism since he was 19 and since his days at a Wurzberg wine institute where he was a classmate of Mr. Catoir, who hired him in 1961. He has clung to his philosophy despite the more interventionist techniques that remain gospel in Germany's 13 wine regions.</p>
        <p>A result is the much-praised 1989 rieslaner from the Mussbacher Eselhaut vineyard. It is a nearly dry auslese -- meaning that only the ripest single grapes or bunches, selectively harvested, were used -- with a carousel of flavors that swirl, dance and glitter, fusing elegance and power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz's 1989 gewurztraminer auslese trocken (dry) from the Haardter Burgergarten vineyard, drenched in the aromas of lychee and roses, contains 14.5 percent alcohol, which Mr. Lingenfelder, for one, criticizes as too high. Because Mr. Schwarz's grapes are always late-picked and thus sugar-heavy, his wines range from 11 to 15 percent alcohol. Most California table wines contain 12 percent.</p>
        <p>Muller-Catoir's grapes bask in the most southerly niche of the Mediterranean-like climate of the Rheinpfalz's Mittelhaardt, a partly mountainous vine-blanketed zone.</p>
        <p>For wine enthusiasts, Mittelhaardt vineyards like the -Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen, Forster Kirchenstuck and Kallstadter Saumagen carry the same cachet as Clos de Vougeot in Burgundy and Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux.</p>
        <p>But who ever heard of Muller-Catoir's Haardter-Burgergarten, Haardter Herrenletten and Mussbacher Eselshaut?</p>
        <p>Not as many potential customers as Mr. Theise would like. "We won't expand production," Mr. Schwarz said, "because I would have to delegate work, and I could not look after every detail necessary for quality."</p>
        <p>Muller-Catoir's 1989's and 1990's, outstanding vintages, can be found now or soon at such stores as Crossroads, 55 West 14th Street (Avenue of the Americas); Pop's, at 256 Long Beach Road, Island Park, L.I.; Calvert-Woodley and Pearson's in Washington; Yankee Spirits in Sturbridge, Mass., and Sam's Wine Warehouse in Chicago.</p>
