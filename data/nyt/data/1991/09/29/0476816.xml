        <p>NICOLA'S is going out with a bang. A few weeks ago it was reported that the landmark restaurant in Glen Cove would close its doors in December or January.</p>
        <p>But before the owners, Nicola and Trisch Zanghi, depart, they are pulling out all the culinary stops. Chef Zanghi and his pastry chef, Diane Bak, are recreating favorites from the past.</p>
        <p>Thus far, the dishes most often requested by diners are the Zanghi gourmand, a sampling of all desserts, and devastatingly chocolate, a cross-section of all chocolate desserts.</p>
        <p>Additionally, two new weekday specials are being offered, a pumpkin souffle with raisin-Jack Daniels ice cream and a hot pear tart with pistachio ice cream.</p>
        <p>Nicola's autumn menu, featuring game and wild-mushroom dishes, is now in place. All wines and champagnes that cost $85 or more are being sold at half their regular prices.</p>
        <p>As the Zanghis clean out their wine cellar and prepare to leave the Island to open a restaurant in Westport, Conn., the Poll brothers, who own Bryant &amp; Cooper in Roslyn, are expanding. They have enlarged the steakhouse's retail market, hired Chef Joseph of the Westbury Hotel in Manhattan and started to ship their steaks nationally.</p>
        <p>The dishes and ingredients available at the retail store are a combination of traditional and modern. Among the traditional are veal and lamb chops, filet mignon, rib steak and boneless sirloin in the 6- to 16-ounce category. Cooked or raw Bell &amp; Evans rotisserie chickens are also popular, as are gravlax, Gorgonzola cheese and shrimp, bean, tomato and onion salads.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the shop's greatest appeal is its ability to offer its entire menu for takeout. Everything from the aged beef to ribs and barbecued duck with mashed potatoes and vegetables can be picked up or delivered.</p>
        <p>At Thanksgiving, prepared turkeys will be available, as will fancy-food Christmas gifts in December.</p>
        <p>The "restaurant quality at home" theme promoted by Bryant &amp; Cooper seems to be succeeding. In fact, its first order for packaged steaks came from an area that knows its meat, Texas.</p>
        <p>OPENINGS: Cafe Donatello, 641 Old Country Road in Plainview, a 70-seat restaurant featuring pasta, pizza and casual cafe fare is owned by the Gianuzzi brothers, Gino, John and Angelo, and their brother-in-law, Pino Spano, who will manage it. They are all involved in other restaurants, including La Caravella in Hicksville and La Pizzetta in East Norwich. Donatello is described as an elegant elaborate Italian cafe.</p>
        <p>Alouette, a French restaurant at 526A Walt Whitman Road in Melville, has opened for lunch and dinner. La Sorbonne was on this site previously. Diners should bring their own alcoholic beverages, because Alouette does not have a liquor license.</p>
