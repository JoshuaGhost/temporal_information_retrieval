        <p>Americans have always shaped their imports to fit native necessity. Clothes, architecture, food, languages that were indigenous in Europe and Africa have been fashioned into a new vernacular in the United States. The process shows up at all levels of cultural life, and "The Complete Roulette Live Recordings of Count Basie and His Orchestra (1959-1962)" underlines exactly how Americans have rewritten imported musical ideas.</p>
        <p>If these eight stunning CD's (or 12 LP's; Mosaic 135; available from Mosaic Records, 35 Melrose Place, Stamford, Conn. 06902) show anything, it is how the big-band vocabulary completely reimagined what brass instruments could do. The disks are a catalogue of musical moans and groans, of sighs and howls, of mock talking and laughter. Using mutes and plungers, the band inventories textures; there's a startling expressiveness at work, as if the musicians were reclaiming the instruments for themselves.</p>

        <p>Americans have always shaped their imports to fit native necessity. Clothes, architecture, food, languages that were indigenous in Europe and Africa have been fashioned into a new vernacular in the United States. The process shows up at all levels of cultural life, and "The Complete Roulette Live Recordings of Count Basie and His Orchestra (1959-1962)" underlines exactly how Americans have rewritten imported musical ideas.</p>
        <p>If these eight stunning CD's (or 12 LP's; Mosaic 135; available from Mosaic Records, 35 Melrose Place, Stamford, Conn. 06902) show anything, it is how the big-band vocabulary completely reimagined what brass instruments could do. The disks are a catalogue of musical moans and groans, of sighs and howls, of mock talking and laughter. Using mutes and plungers, the band inventories textures; there's a startling expressiveness at work, as if the musicians were reclaiming the instruments for themselves.</p>
        <p>But what's really astounding is the thoroughness, by the late 1950's, with which American musicians had completely revised the notion of a melody. In many of these pieces, melody is an adjunct of rhythm, with riffs -- repeating, pungent and fast -- creating pointillistic melodies. Horns swoop into sighs, and brass exclamations carry portions of a composition. Fragments, seemingly bits of older, forgotten melodies, meld together to form full-fledged statements. And throughout, distinctive blues melodies inform everything, producing music that had simply never been heard before.</p>
        <p>Featuring more than eight hours of music, most of it previously unreleased, these CD's offer an unprecedented look at an orchestra in action. The set documents the band in three different locations, the first at a party in Miami, the second at the band's musical home at Birdland in Manhattan and the last at an engagement in Sweden. Sarah Vaughan sits in during one set at Birdland; listen carefully and it's possible to hear musicians joking while they play. The music itself is extraordinary, and yet casual.</p>
        <p>The set captures one of America's finest orchestras at the peak of its precision and authority. Known as the New Testament Band (as opposed to the first great Basie orchestra, started in 1935 and called the Old Testament Band), the group refutes its reputation as a simple, hard-swinging orchestra. Its arrangers -- Thad Jones, Frank Foster, Ernie Wilkins and Neal Hefti, among others -- produced music that balanced the functionalism of a dance orchestra with the refinement of music produced for no other reason than the exercising of the imagination.</p>
        <p>By the late 1950's, Mr. Basie's early rhythmic innovation -- a swinging 4/4 beat -- had been assimilated in jazz and popular music, and Mr. Basie still kept a rhythm section that knew how to swing. Including Freddie Green on guitar, Eddie Jones on bass and Sonny Payne on drums (Mr. Jones and Mr. Payne are replaced on the Swedish dates by Ike Isaacs and Louis Bellson), the rhythm section makes movement, both musical and physical, the art that it deserves to be. The only thing missing from this boxed set is the audience, who once matched the improvising prowess of the orchestra step by step.  RECORDINGS VIEW</p>
