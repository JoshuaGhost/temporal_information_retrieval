        <p>The Giants will play the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, and the first question is not who will win, but who will show up.</p>
        <p>Will these be the Giants with their tightly wound offense of this season or will Jeff Hostetler finally be allowed to open up the passing game?</p>
        <p>Will these be the Cowboys who gave up 11 sacks to the Philadelphia Eagles two weeks ago or the Cowboys who sprung Emmitt Smith for 182 yards rushing against the Phoenix Cardinals last Sunday?</p>
        <p>Both teams have played unevenly. Both have 2-2 records, not bad for the rebuilding Cowboys, but embarrassing and frustrating for the Super Bowl champion Giants.</p>
        <p>This game is especially important to the Giants because they are playing six of their next seven games against division rivals. They are already two games behind the unbeaten Washington Redskins.</p>
        <p>The game will attract a sellout crowd of 65,000 spectators to Texas Stadium. The matchup will be carried at 1 P.M. in New York on Channel 2 and WNEW AM 1130. The Giants have won their last six games with the Cowboys. Finesse Over Power</p>
        <p>This season, with a new head coach in Ray Handley and a new quarterback in Jeff Hostetler, the Giants have lacked spark on offense. Handley's ball-control offense is even more conservative than that of his predecessor, Bill Parcells.</p>
        <p>Hostetler wants more freedom to pass downfield. He may get it against a young, gung-ho Cowboys defense that is not as good as some statistics indicate.</p>
        <p>The Cowboys have allowed an average of only 3.1 yards rushing. Only the Redskins have run effectively against them, and they did it with finesse blocking rather than power blocking.</p>
        <p>But the Cowboys keep giving up big plays. They have made only five sacks, two fumble recoveries and one interception. The linebacking group lacks depth. Issiac Holt, their best defensive back, has been inconsistent.</p>
        <p>The Cowboys must contain a Giants offense that ranks fourth in the National Football League in rushing, but only 24th in passing. That offense has scored only five touchdowns in four games.</p>
        <p>But the Giants can run. Last Sunday, against the Cleveland Browns, Rodney Hampton rushed 17 times for 104 yards and Lewis Tillman 14 times for 90 yards.</p>
        <p>The Browns took away the Giants' deep passing game by playing the cornerbacks to the outside and far off the line of scrimmage. Against the Cowboys, the Giants can combat similar tactics by giving Hostetler more freedom to roll out and keep the ball, the way he did last season in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>This season, the Giants have survived because of their tough defense. They lead the league in pass defense (124.8 yards a game) and rank third in total defense (231.8). Lawrence Taylor, Leonard Marshall and Carl Banks have created heavy pressure on quarterbacks. Putting on the Pressure</p>
        <p>Even with Erik Howard sidelined by back surgery, the Giants should get pressure on the Cowboys' quarterback, Troy Aikman. They have contained him in the past by pressuring him on first down and keeping him from short-yardage situations.</p>
        <p>Aikman will probably throw quick passes to Smith and his tight ends. He has a good deep receiver in Michael Irvin and an underrated tight end in Jay Novacek.</p>
        <p>What the Cowboys want most is to unleash Smith. They have put the ball in his hands on 42 percent of their offensive plays this year, and he has accounted for 48 percent of their yardage. But he may have trouble even against the Giants' wounded defense.</p>
        <p>"We've had problems running on them in the past," said Coach Jimmy Johnson of the Cowboys, "but so has everybody else."  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
