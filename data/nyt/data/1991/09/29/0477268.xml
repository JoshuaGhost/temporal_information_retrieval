        <p>Joel Brinkley presents a clear picture of the price Israel is paying for security in his article ("A Price for Security," Sept. 8). However, he emphasizes the nation's weaknesses without giving enough attention to the reasons for these imperfections. As he points out, absorption of immigrants is Israel's reason for being. It is the only nation in the world that opens its doors to Jews without prejudice. But Israel is a small nation, and as Alma Richter eloquently states in the article: ". . . The real problem is . . . with all the wars, we don't have time."</p>
        <p>If lsrael is guilty of anything, it is of attempting to care for forgotten people without a wealth of resources. MARGARET RICHTER</p>
