        <p>National Football League owners have a proposed collective bargaining agreement ready for presentation to players, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Friday.</p>
        <p>During a meeting of the league's owners here, Tagliabue said that Harold Henderson, executive vice president of the N.F.L. executive committee, would soon present a "quite comprehensive" proposal to the players' lawyers.</p>
        <p>Henderson, also the executive vice president of the labor relations committee, said he expected to make contact soon with the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal, Manges, which represents the players in antitrust litigation against the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>"We have been working for many weeks on putting together a proposal for the players," Henderson said. "Today was the last piece of the big picture."</p>
        <p>In their offer to the players, the owners are expected to include a two-tiered system of unrestricted free agency, a salary cap (estimated at from $28 million to $30 million per team), a rookie wage and bonus scale and an increased benefits package.</p>
