        <p>It does not happen often, but shareholders of large corporations do have the power to force changes in management. At the Baltimore Bancorporation, shareholders, who were dismayed by years of weak earnings and the rejection last year of an attractive takeover bid, succeeded last week in gaining control of the board and ousting the old management.</p>
        <p>The leader of the revolt, which took only six months to complete, was Edwin F. Hale, owner of a trucking and shipping business and the Baltimore Blast, an indoor soccer team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale, who is 51 and has no banking experience, said he had no plans to take control of Maryland's fourth-largest bank until other shareholders approached him in March. But he was receptive to the idea because his past experience with the bank left him unimpressed.</p>
        <p>"They rejected me for a loan in 1987," he recalled. "I was a customer they wooed, with the chairman coming to visit and agreeing to make a loan." Because of its large size, $20 million, the loan required approval by the board, which turned it down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale's shipping and trucking business survived the blow, but the experience still rankles him. "I would have been a prototype for the kinds of accounts they should seek, and I'm sure there are lots of people in this area like me."</p>
        <p>Now that he is chairman, Mr. Hale said he wants Baltimore Bancorp to work harder to cultivate local businesses. Previous management concentrated too much on "one-time deals with real estate developers" to generate loans that are now causing trouble for the bank.</p>
        <p>To manage that change, the new board tapped Charles H. Whittum Jr. as chief executive. Mr. Whittum was previously a top executive at Union Trust Bancorp of Baltimore and its successor company, Signet Bank of Maryland.</p>
