        <p>No Country Cousin</p>
        <p>Country music is widely viewed as an isolated branch of the music business, with offices in Nashville instead of New York or Los Angeles, separate charts in Billboard and a publicity system that ignores most mainstream publications. The separation has always made country music seem, from the outside, a poor relation of mainstream popular music.</p>
        <p>With the recent changeover of the tabulating system on Billboard's main pop chart, however, it is clear that country music is a powerful force in the United States.</p>
        <p>Its power is underscored by the release last week of the country singer and songwriter Garth Brooks's "Ropin' the Wind," which racked up advance orders totaling two million copies, according to his company, Capitol; Guns 'n' Roses' two albums, "Use Your Illusions I" and "Use Your Illusions II" compiled orders of 4.3 million. Mr. Brooks's "No Fences," released last year, is still in the top 20 of Billboard's pop chart. Sources in the industry expect "Ropin' the Wind" to enter the pop charts next week in the No. 1 position, beating out Metallica and Natalie Cole.</p>
        <p>"I've been doing this since 1956, and I haven't seen anything like this since Elvis," said Jimmy Bowen, the president of Capitol Nashville. "We shipped two million copies of the record, and by Friday we had re-orders for 650,000 copies. K-Mart sold half of their initial order in the first day. This will be the biggest country record ever."</p>
        <p>"If it weren't for the Guns 'n' Roses project, the record would have been the story of the year," said Lew Garrett, vice president of sales for the Camelot record chain. "We've already sold 60,000 copies out of the 100,000 that we ordered, and we've reordered another 25,000. The best analogy is Metallica, whose recent CD we ordered 100,000 of as well. Brooks is a pop mainstream artist, unquestionably a monster act. Though his core following is in the Southwest, he's just as big in Canton, Ohio, as he is in Hattiesburg, Miss. But country music is just exploding everywhere."</p>
        <p>"I'm thankful for the success, but I don't have a clue why it's happening," said Mr. Garth, who is 29 years old. "I think it's being aided from the pop side by people looking for lyrics. When I write, I report real life, which pop music doesn't really do anymore. Real life is more uplifting, but it can be real negative. Country music isn't afraid to tackle Vietnam, or wife beating. My guess is that we'll be hearing a whole lot of songs about the Persian Gulf soon."</p>
        <p>All this activity in country music, underscored by its success in Billboard's charts, is said to have upper-level management at several companies preparing to set up offices in Nashville.</p>
        <p>"Giant is coming in here," Mr. Bowen said. "Elektra seems to be very serious. But it makes so much sense. You have this huge baby-boom audience that has grown up on top-40 radio, and they're all looking for music with lyrics, and we're that. And the younger generation, unless it comes from the inner city, isn't interested in rap or dance music. Garth's biggest demographic is 18 to 25, so younger people are hooking on to country music. Next week Garth will probably have three albums in the top 50, and two in the top 15."  Obscure Noise</p>
        <p>At CBGB's in Manhattan on Saturday night, a handful of New York's best obscure bands will be grinding out some noise, including Steve Fitch's Empty Body, Circle X, Borgetomagus, Rudolph Grey, Timber, David Linton's Electric Outhouse, the Unsane and more. Some of them play freely improvised music, others use noise in a pop context and others take their cues from the No Wave movement in New York in the early 1980's. They're all loud, and aggressive, and they are all part of a new compilation from Matador Records, "New York Eye and Ear Control."</p>
        <p>"The only unifying esthetic on the record is that I like the band," said Gerard Cosloy, the co-manager of Matador. "What they have in common is that most of them don't ever get paid. But really, the bands would be bummed out if they were lumped together, though some of them play the same circuit, or have shared members or gear."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cosloy started thinking about the compilation about two years ago, when he was running another record label. "There were a bunch of New York bands I was a big fan of -- Cop Shoot Cop, Owt, Circle X -- who were making exciting new-sounding music," he said. "I left the label and came to Matador, and in the interim some had been signed. It didn't seem realistic to sign them all to individual record deals, so I figured if I did a compilation it might help the rest get record deals on their own. And I figure if someone buys a record because of Cop Shoot Cop and hears David Linton or Steve Fitch, it's accomplished something. It's really meant to be a fun record, and to show people that Borgetomagus have just as much right headlining CBGB's or the Knitting Factory as Cop Shoot Cop."  Music as Meaning</p>
        <p>The singer and songwriter Robyn Hitchcock has recently released an album, "Perspex Island," (A&amp;M) and as usual, it is often elliptical, relying on the music as much as the words to generate meaning. Mr. Hitchcock has been producing a string of mostly brilliant albums for a decade now, and his success -- mainly on the college circuit -- suggests that there's an audience for a nasty and almost medieval imagination. "Perspex Island" is supposed to be about love, but it is often hard to tell.</p>
        <p>"Well, the words are incidental," said Mr. Hitchock the other day. "There was a time when I wrote words and set them to music, but it didn't work. Now I use as few chord changes and words as possible. I found out years ago that you could never get away from the mike because you were singing a lot and you'd always share a picture with a microphone."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hitchcock's songs often sound like automatic writing, or as if they'd been glued together from fragments of unassociated writing.</p>
        <p>"If I had grown up pre-Bob Dylan I'd be a professor or a poet, or I would have dabbled in painting," Mr. Hitchcock said. "Or I'd be a comedian. But singing is more powerful than poetry. Singing is some form of prayer. You paint with words and music to get to a point of invocation or exorcism."</p>
