        <p>In what may be an important bid to capture a lucrative share of the international communications market, British Telecommunications P.L.C. on Thursday will announce details of a new subsidiary that will manage worldwide communications networks for multinational corporations.</p>
        <p>The new venture, the Syncordia Corporation, will be based in Atlanta and represents an attempt by the British telephone company to capture some of the big-business customers served by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.</p>
        <p>The new company will provide a worldwide communications network, capable of transmitting telephone, data and video images and will offer to manage virtually all of a corporation's worldwide internal communications network. In part, the premise of the company is that many corporations now want to have an outside firm manage their telecommunications needs. Possible I.B.M. Deal</p>
        <p>Company officials said they were in "detailed discussions" to supply services for the International Business Machines Corporation in Europe and have already signed two big customers. One is Amadeus, the European airline reservation system owned by five European airlines, which will be linked with the Sabre reservation system owned by American Airlines. The other customer is BP Chemicals, a subsidiary of British Petroleum, which will use Syncordia to link offices in 34 cities over the next several years.</p>
        <p>But the new company has gotten off to a somewhat rocky start because British Telecom was unable to recruit two big partners who were expected to be part of the deal.</p>
        <p>British Telecom had originally anticipated forming the new venture with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom. A combination of with the Japanese and German telecommunications giants would have been a formidable new force in the market.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear why N.T.T. and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom decided not to join, though officials of British Telecom say they are optimistic about recruiting them at some point.</p>
        <p>The new venture will not significantly expand communications services, but it could make them easier and more flexible to use.</p>
        <p>Large companies now order all the circuits and services for their private networks, which connect offices on different continents, from one or more long-distance companies. But analysts say these networks have become increasingly complicated and expensive to manage, and many corporations are eager to turn the task over to a single company.  Global Corporate Needs</p>
        <p>"We are in a situation where the multinational corporations have seen their overseas businesses grow faster than their national businesses, and they realize their network strategies have been determined more by regional divisions and departments than by a global corporate strategy," said Berge Ayvazian, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston.</p>
        <p>Gerald W. Thames, president of Syncordia, said large customers can get greater flexibility by subscribing to the new system because they can simply order the services they want and leave the management to Syncordia.</p>
        <p>In essence, the large customers would have what resemble global private networks that already link their offices through leased telephone lines, but the services would be offered over the larger, shared network that the new company will be running.</p>
        <p>"It is only now, with deregulation taking place around the world and a huge growth in demand that the economics have come about so that a company like ours can be built," Mr. Thames said.</p>
