        <p>Peter Bellamy, who helped spark a revival of British folk music, died last Thursday near his home in Keighley, in Yorkshire. He was 47 years old.</p>
        <p>He committed suicide, taking an overdose of tranquilizers and alcohol, his family said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bellamy was born in Norwich. He dropped out of art school after becoming interested in folk music, and in 1965 founded a trio with Royston Wood and Heather Wood, who are not related. Because they were performing at a club called Tradition, they called themselves the Young Tradition. The group studied harmony singing with the Copper Family, a folk group, and reintroduced unaccompanied harmony singing to a folk scene that had concentrated on solo performance and performances with instruments. The Young Tradition released three albums between 1965 and 1969, and its style and repertory influenced a wave of English folk and folk-rock groups.</p>
        <p>After the Young Tradition broke up, Mr. Bellamy began a solo career. He wrote a folk opera, "The Transports," and made four albums of Kipling poetry set to his own music. Those songs were the basis of a one-man show, "Kipling's History of England," which toured the United States and Britain. Mr. Bellamy released nine other albums of British and American songs, most recently in 1990. He also produced albums for other folk performers, including the Copper Family.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Jenny; his mother, Hilda; two brothers, Dickon and John, and a sister, Helen Walters, all of England, and a sister, Marion Wilton, of Los Alamos, Calif.</p>
