        <p>The recorded voice is droning on about the Metropolitan Museum of Art: "You should now be in the sunlit 16th-century Spanish patio." Suddenly the voice pauses, then comments slyly: "Isn't it sunlit? Isn't it Spanish? What a patio!"</p>
        <p>O.K., this is not "Masterpieces With the Director," the classic Acousti-Guide tour of 19 of the Met's priceless treasures, the officially sanctioned tour so sonorously conducted by Philippe de Montebello, director of the museum.</p>

        <p>The recorded voice is droning on about the Metropolitan Museum of Art: "You should now be in the sunlit 16th-century Spanish patio." Suddenly the voice pauses, then comments slyly: "Isn't it sunlit? Isn't it Spanish? What a patio!"</p>
        <p>O.K., this is not "Masterpieces With the Director," the classic Acousti-Guide tour of 19 of the Met's priceless treasures, the officially sanctioned tour so sonorously conducted by Philippe de Montebello, director of the museum.</p>
        <p>No, the recording in question is an alternative audio tour of the Met, "Masterpieces Without the Director," and it will be available for one day only. Starting at 2 P.M. Saturday, a group of artists will lend the tapes free at their alternative-tour booth on the Fifth Avenue plaza outside the Met. (The rain date is Sunday.)</p>
        <p>The Conceptual Art project was done under the auspices of Creative Time Citywide, a Manhattan-based group that sponsors unusual art projects in unusual city spaces.</p>
        <p>The artists' tape is not so much a sendup of the Met's tour as a "democratic alternative," said Spencer Finch, a painter who, with Paul Ramirez, a sculptor, created the project. "We're not trying to make fun of the works of art or the institution. Our idea is to democratize the viewing process."  Visitors Talk Back</p>
        <p>The alternative tour, playable on museumgoers' own portable cassette machines, follows the route of the 19 masterworks on the official Metropolitan tour, including "Cypresses" by Vincent van Gogh and "The Last Judgement" by Jan van Eyck. The Metropolitan will permit the tapes to be used in the museum, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>"Our tape gives average museumgoers a chance to speak for themselves," Mr. Ramirez said. Quite literally: The 44-minute tape was culled from 20 hours of interviews with museum visitors on the steps outside the Met's main entrance.</p>
        <p>Some of the comments on the alternative tape are appropriately art-historical, but among the other statements are "I mean, anyone can do this"; "I give this one a thumbs-up rating"; "The hairstyle's pretty weird," and "You've seen one of these, you've seen them all." Mr. de Montebello, whom Mr. Ramirez described as "sort of the official voice of art," is there too, briefly.</p>
        <p>Ultimately the tapes themselves, along with a printed tour booklet with maps of the museum, will be packaged in "Mona Lisa Brand" mock-tomato cans and sold in a limited edition -- of course -- as works of art.</p>
