        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 9 front-page account of the beginning phase of the Family Support Act, which requires states to place a rising percentage of welfare recipients in work, training or education programs, describes the experience of two Oklahoma welfare recipients. One is a 28-year-old mother of four, the other a 30-year-old mother of six. Neither seems to be making much progress. A Washington-based commentator suggests we may be putting people into "a never-ending stream of self-esteem classes."</p>

        <p>Your Sept. 9 front-page account of the beginning phase of the Family Support Act, which requires states to place a rising percentage of welfare recipients in work, training or education programs, describes the experience of two Oklahoma welfare recipients. One is a 28-year-old mother of four, the other a 30-year-old mother of six. Neither seems to be making much progress. A Washington-based commentator suggests we may be putting people into "a never-ending stream of self-esteem classes."</p>
        <p>Possibly. Still, one object of the 1988 act was to stop making welfare policy by anecdote. Another was to face facts. The facts are that welfare dependency, like illegitimacy, has attained unprecedented proportions. In the current issue of America, I report our newest data. Of children born in the late 1960's, almost one-quarter were actually on welfare before reaching 18. This included 72.3 percent of black children. We project that almost one-third of children born in 1980 will have been on welfare before they reach 18.</p>
        <p>We are not going to help most of the mothers of most of these children. Talk all you want to, we aren't. Mothers of four? Mothers of six? Hardly at all. (Only 4.2 percent of families include four illegitimate children.) The median welfare family has two children. The Family Support Act concentrates on small families, with mothers younger than 24.</p>
        <p>Your report notes that in 1990 Congress offered states $800 million for the program but that only $272 million was spent. Surprise! This work is not easy. The easy thing to do is simply to send out checks in the name of noncoercion or whatever. This year $1 billion is available, and most of it is being spent. The states asked for this program and are working at it. Not least in Oklahoma, where a former United States Senator, Henry L. Bellmon, came out of retirement to become director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services and helped mightily with the 1988 legislation. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN U.S. Senator from New York Washington, Sept. 13, 1991</p>
