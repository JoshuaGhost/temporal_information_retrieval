        <p>Brazil said today that it would present a new plan to foreign creditors next week to reschedule the $52 billion it owes to private banks.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian central bank said its top debt negotiator, Pedro Malan, would travel to New York to meet with the banks' steering committee on Monday.</p>
        <p>Officials hope the United States Government will put pressure on the banks to reach a deal with Brazil, which owes a total of $123 billion to foreign lenders.</p>
        <p>In August, Brazil offered to convert its private foreign debt into five new types of medium- and long-term bonds. But creditors demanded a shorter repayment period, higher interest rates and payment guarantees.</p>
        <p>No details of Brazil's new proposal were given. But the Government is expected to ask for new loans in exchange for concessions on the bond issue. The money would reportedly be used to buy United States Treasury bonds. Their earnings would guarantee the payment of principal on the new bonds that Brazil issues.</p>
