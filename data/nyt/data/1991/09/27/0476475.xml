        <p>New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation yesterday suspended the medical privileges of a Harlem Hospital doctor who, witnesses said, refused admission to a woman in the final stages of labor because the hospital's obstetrics ward was full.</p>
        <p>Assisted by the ambulance crew that brought her to the hospital before dawn last Sunday, the woman, Charlesetta Brown, gave birth to a baby boy as she lay on a stretcher on the floor of the admissions room at the hospital at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue, while several hospital employees looked on.</p>
        <p>"The woman was hysterical -- she couldn't understand why the hospital was treating her like that," Mary Dandridge, the Emergency Medical Technician who helped deliver the baby, recalled in an interview yesterday. "She had her baby in the middle of the floor and the doctor refused to give her any attention -- he just sat there at his desk talking on the phone."</p>
        <p>As investigations of the incident by city and state health authorities and the Manhattan District Attorney's office got under way, city officials called the doctor's decision an apparent violation of hospital and city policy as well as state law and said disciplinary charges were being drawn up.</p>
        <p>"This is just unacceptable behavior and outrageous," Steven Matthews, a spokesman for the hospitals corporation. He said the agency was withholding the name of the doctor, a senior resident, pending the outcome of disciplinary action.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dandridge, in a detailed account of last Sunday's events, said she and her ambulance-crew partner, William Ludwig, picked up Ms. Brown at her home at 2680 Eighth Avenue, near 144th Street, at 5:15 A.M. and took her to Harlem Hospital because she had received prenatal care there and because her labor was in its final stages and it was the closest hospital.</p>
        <p>The ambulance arrived at 5:22 A.M., and they took Ms. Brown to the fourth floor obstetrics admissions room. The doctor in charge of admissions said that the ward was full, and that while there might be a bed for the mother there would be no space for the baby if complications developed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dandridge said the hospital was in a status called "diversion," in which patients are taken to another hospital if certain departments are full. But an E.M.S. crew is authorized to override any refusal to admit a patient who needs immediate emergency care.</p>
        <p>"I informed him that we were unable to leave," said Ms. Dandridge, who has been a medical technician for six years. "Apparently, she was going to give birth any minute. He adamantly refused. We notified our dispatcher and they sent over a supervisor."</p>
        <p>The supervisor, Pamela Fusco, tried to reason with the doctor, as did a hospital supervisor. "But he still refused," Ms. Dandridge said.</p>
        <p>With Ms. Brown about to deliver the baby, Ms. Dandridge asked other hospital personnel for an obstetrics kit containing suction equipment, clamps and a scalpel to cut the umbillical cord. "I was told the kits were counted and they couldn't give me one," said Ms. Dandridge, who ran down to her ambulance and got a kit.</p>
        <p>"Two minutes later, she delivered," she went on. "The baby was fine. I then asked for something to wrap around the baby to keep him warm. A doctor grabbed some paper examination gowns and threw them at us. I took a couple and wrapped the baby up. Then somebody from pediatrics came in and took the baby for an evaluation."</p>
        <p>The mother remained on the stretcher until 6:40, while the doctor who had refused admission talked on the telephone, Ms. Dandridge said.</p>
        <p>Asked her view of his conduct, she said: "Very poor, unbecoming as a professional."</p>
