        <p>A majority of the Philippine Senate declared its opposition today to a 10-year extension of the American lease on the Subic Bay Naval Station, raising the threat that the United States may soon be forced to withdraw from its largest military installation in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p>A majority of the Philippine Senate declared its opposition today to a 10-year extension of the American lease on the Subic Bay Naval Station, raising the threat that the United States may soon be forced to withdraw from its largest military installation in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Although today's vote was a preliminary one, it was taken seriously in Washington, where Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "We obviously can't stay where we're not wanted, and we won't."</p>
        <p>"It's a choice they have to make," Mr. Cheney added. "If they're not prepared to ratify the treaty and extend the agreement, then we will in fact depart."  Outcome Is Unclear</p>
        <p>The Senate's foreign relations committee, made up of all 23 members of the Senate, voted today 12 to 11 against the treaty.</p>
        <p>But it was uncertain whether the committee's nonbinding vote and the statements in Washington represented continued diplomatic sparring, or signaled the coming end of the 90-year American presence where thousands of American forces are based.</p>
        <p>At one time, because of the need to confront the Soviet Union and China, the American military presence in the Philippines was deemed vital to American strategic interests. But with the changed world situation, the strategic concerns have faded, although Washington professes to want still to keep the Subic base to maintain stability in the Philippines and to protect against unforeseen developments in Asia.  Final Vote Yet to Come</p>
        <p>Since the 23 senators voted today only as the committee, the formal vote by the Senate is yet to come, possibly as early as the latter part of this week.</p>
        <p>Under the Philippine Constitution, the lease extension for Subic would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate -- a margin impossible to imagine if the vote were held today, but perhaps not impossible to obtain several weeks or a year from now. A new Senate will be elected next spring.</p>
        <p>President Corazon C. Aquino has called on supporters of the new treaty, which was hammered out this summer between her negotiators and envoys of the United States, to join in a march on the Senate Tuesday to convince the lawmakers of the political risks they face by voting against it.</p>
        <p>Commercials broadcast repeatedly on Manila television stations tonight called for a large-scale turnout at the march as a means of "letting the voice of the silent majority be heard."</p>
        <p>Late tonight, the Philippine left made its feelings known, as well. About 50 demonstrrators, some wearing death masks, marched outside the United States Embassy and tried to burn an American flag. The police broke up the demonstration, a common sort of protest here. There were no reports of serious injuries.</p>
        <p>The protesters' objections to the presence of American bases runs deeper than a demand for more money to extend the leases. Opposition to the bases has spread in recent years from left-wing radicals through the middle-class establishment.</p>
        <p>A consensus has emerged that the American military presence is a vestige of colonialism, and that the nation cannot be truly free as long as the American troops remain.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Foreign Secretary, Raul Manglapus, the chief negotiator, has repeatedly said the Philippines must "slay the American father image" before it can be a mature nation.</p>
        <p>Besides the $203 million in annual payments under the new lease agreement, the Subic naval base is worth additional hundreds of millions of dollars each year to the Philippine economy and thousands of jobs. Public opinion polls suggest that the majority of Filipinos support the new treaty, even if some of the nation's most prominent politicians and intellectuals do not.</p>
        <p>American officials have taken the position that they could accept rejection of the treaty and were ready to consider establishing an installation in Singapore or other more hospitable places. But officials in Washington also say they hope that they can keep the extensive, deep-water harbor at Subic Bay, with its accompanying Naval Air Station.  Huge Cost of Moving</p>
        <p>The cost of moving would be huge, and Subic Bay possesses one of the most highly skilled local work forces in the world. They are paid considerably less than comparable workers in the United States or Guam, another possible substitute base.</p>
        <p>The Senate foreign relations committee made its opposition to the treaty known today in the form of a resolution describing the new lease on Subic as "a one-sided, unequal agreement that does not provide for reciprocal rights" and that tends to perpetuate "Philippine dependence on the United States for defense and security."</p>
        <p>After the vote today, the Senate President, Jovito Salonga, said, "For all practical purposes, the treaty is defeated."</p>
        <p>Yet while the base agreement would now appear to fall far short of the required two-thirds vote, it is believed in some political and diplomatic circles that it will eventually be approved in one form or another, and that the 7,000 Americans now assigned to Subic will be allowed to remain.  One-Year Grace Period</p>
        <p>Although the current lease agreement for the sprawling base runs out next Monday, the United States could invoke a clause permitting Americans to remain at Subic for another year, allowing time to reach a new agreement on the base.</p>
        <p>In a televised address to the nation, Mrs. Aquino -- whose term ends next year and who appears ready to make ratification of the base agreement the last great battle of her administration -- declared that it would be "ill-advised, even foolish," for the Senate to reject the treaty.</p>
        <p>Under the base agreement, the United States will pay the Philippines $203 million annually for a 10-year extension on the lease for Subic, a huge repair and logistics center for the United States Seventh Fleet.</p>
        <p>The United States is now in the process of abandoning Clark Air Base, the other major American military installation in the Philippines, after it was smothered by volcanic ash released in the eruption in June of Mount Pinatubo.</p>
