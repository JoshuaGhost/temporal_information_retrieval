        <p>Seekircher Steel Window Repair Corporation</p>
        <p>630 Saw Mill River Road, Ardsley, N.Y. 10502; (914) 693-1920.</p>
        <p>When John Seekircher began repairing steel casement windows in 1977, he could only find part-time work. Homeowners and co-op boards routinely replaced old steel frame windows with aluminum or vinyl-frame double-hung sash windows. But these days restoring steel window frames is a full-time job.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people buying Westchester Tudors are repairing the old windows instead of installing aluminum replacement windows," said Mr. Seekircher, who recently repaired 160 steel frame windows on a huge Westchester house.</p>
        <p>And most landmark buildings with steel casement windows, including many Central Park West co-ops, are required to either restore existing frames or find identical steel replacements. "These windows have a distinctive look," said Mr. Seekircher.</p>
        <p>Steel casement windows, popular in late 19th-century Europe, were installed in countless New York-area homes and apartment buildings before World War II. Old windows can often be revived with minimal repairs. A professional cleaning can open windows sealed shut with age. Hinges can be repaired. Cranks can be replaced. And frames can be realigned so windows close tight. Storm windows and retractable screens can also be installed inside the windows.</p>
        <p>Rotting steel sections can be repaired as well. Mr. Seekircher recently rebuilt the bottom of a steel-frame door for a Park Avenue apartment.  Basic adjustment and service starts at about $30 a window.</p>
        <p>American Steel Window Service Company</p>
        <p>108 West 17th Street, New York, N.Y. 10011; (212) 242-8131.</p>
        <p>The American Steel Window Service Company, a 76-year-old family-run business, specializes in altering and repairing steel windows, including casement windows, factory-style windows and old-style metal windows with side chains. But a big part of American Steel's business is supplying handles, hinges and other hard-to-find parts.</p>
        <p>Peter Weinberger, the owner said his father, Dan, had purchased large amounts of hardware from several manufacturers going out of business.</p>
        <p>Though they usually predate air-conditioners, steel casement windows can be adapted to accommodate most cooling units, Mr. Weinberger said. Basic repairs start at around $40 a window.</p>
        <p>A &amp; S Windows</p>
        <p>88-19 76th Avenue, Glendale, Queens 11385; (718) 275-7900.</p>
        <p>Architects are designing buildings with steel windows again, said Louis Lehrbaum, whose 34-year-old company, A &amp; S Windows, manufactures steel window frames for both residential and industrial use. Aluminum frames tend to be thick. Steel, in contrast, "makes a nice narrow sideline for a different look," Mr. Lehrbaum said. "They're putting them in new schools and factories."</p>
        <p>A &amp; S manufactures both steel windows and doors and does customized work. Prices start at around $100 a window frame. Finished windows are also available.</p>
