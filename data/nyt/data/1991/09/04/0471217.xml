        <p>The dollar weakened yesterday in quiet post-holiday trading. Dealers seemed to shrug off the latest data indicating continued economic growth during the summer.</p>
        <p>Gold prices were mixed after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $348.30 an ounce, up 20 cents from late Friday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $347.90 an ounce, off 10 cents from Friday.</p>
        <p>Currency traders said reports yesterday showing growth in manufacturing during August and in construction spending during July failed to raise demand for the dollar.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of business activity rose last month by a greater-than-expected amount. In another report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.6 percent in July. Normally Bullish Reports</p>
        <p>Earl I. Johnson, a vice president for Harris Trust &amp; Company in Chicago, said both reports would normally be bullish for the dollar because they would reduce the pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which can depress the dollar's value.</p>
        <p>But he said, "I think a lot of people are still skeptical about the underlying strength in the economy and want to see the unemployment data."</p>
        <p>The Labor Department is expected to release its August jobless figures on Friday.</p>
        <p>In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 136.40 yen, down 0.44 yen from Monday. The dollar traded later in London at 136 yen, and at 135.80 yen in New York, down from 136.83 Friday. Financial markets in the United States were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.</p>
        <p>The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.6920, from $1.6847 late Monday in London. In New York, it fetched $1.6950, up from $1.6810 Friday. Other Dollar Quotes</p>
        <p>Other late dollar quotes in New York, compared with Friday's late prices, included: 1.7365 German marks, down from 1.7470; 1.5225 Swiss francs, down from 1.5264; 5.9005 French francs, down from 5.9325; 1,295.75 Italian lire, down from 1,302.75, and 1.14145 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14175.</p>
