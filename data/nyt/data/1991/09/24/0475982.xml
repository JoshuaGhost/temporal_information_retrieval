        <p>For her, the world centers of art are not the Met, the Louvre, the Prado and the British Museum. They are the Hallen Sur Neue Kunst in a converted warehouse in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, the Castello Rivoli in a converted 17th-center palazzo outside of Turin -- and the Dia Center for the Arts here in SoHo.</p>
        <p>She is Lynne Cooke, recently appointed curator of the last of these Meccas of contemporary art, succeeding Gary Garrells, who has moved on to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. The Dia Center, which was known as the Dia Art Foundation before its reorganization in 1987, is one of the country's wealthiest institutions devoted to contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Established in 1974 as a non-profit foundation with a gift from Philippa and Heiner Friedrich (Mrs. Friedrich is the youngest daughter of the art patron Dominique de Menil) that eventually rose to $40 million, Dia soon became a substantial museum with holdings of works by Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, Dan Flavin, Joseph Beuys and others.  Balance Recovered</p>
        <p>In 1987, Dia became overextended, and in order to reduce expenditures sold several of its Manhattan buildings and part of its art collection. In recent years, however, the center has recovered its balance and produced a number of highly regarded shows of contemporary art in the museum-sized galleries at its exhibition space in the four-story renovated warehouse at 548 West 22d Street.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooke's budget for the West 22nd Street site comes to just under $1 million, with about half of that going to operating costs and half for exhibitions.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview at Dia's Mercer Street headquarters, Ms. Cooke, who was born in Australia and has spent most of her adult life in Britain, spoke of the art scene's current trend toward internationalism.</p>
        <p>"There is no real center of contemporary art any more," she said, reflecting on the days when the dominance of Abstract Expressionism and later Pop Art made New York the hub of the international art scene. "I don't think you really</p>
        <p>need</p>
        <p>a center today. Access to information is much greater. There are more magazines, more ways of making information available, more important museums in places other than New York. There are many important shows that don't even get to New York. Yes, I think there is a sense today that there is much to be seen elsewhere."</p>
        <p>As a result, she said, a curator must keep on the move. "If you're really interested in seeing work of the highest calibre, very well presented," she said, "then it's necessary to visit Schaffhausen or Rivoli or Dia. One of the things these places have in common is that you might not be going there otherwise but you go there because you particularly want to see those shows."</p>
        <p>She cited a pair of artists she admires. "James Coleman works with 35-millimeter slides, film, video and even theater performance, and the issues he is addressing have to do with perception, representation and identity. There's one piece, for example, where he's taken a short extract from the Dempsey-Tunney fight of 1927. You walk into a claustrophobic, dark space where this film is being projected on a loop and you see it over and over again. There's a voiceover which is this anguished boxer trying to retain his title, and the whole thing is syncopated like a heartbeat. You're both in his head and in this space. You see yourself as both a spectator and almost a participant, and that dialogue between passive viewer and participant is what you experience in the work. You are made complicit in the act of giving meaning."</p>
        <p>"Rebecca Horn," Ms. Cooke continued, "is a German artist who makes works that are very finely crafted but have a charged quality. They often involve moving components, a sense of danger, desire or some erotic attraction. Sometimes there's a pendulum swinging, or a three-dimensional construction. They can be about voyeurism, which is part of the activity of looking at art, and the desire that's conjured up by the work for ownership, for engagement, for whatever."</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooke's travels have familiarized her with the United States. Until November, she will divide her time between New York and Pittsburgh, where she is co-curator of the Carnegie International show that opens next month at the Carnegie Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>"I've been coming here a long time," said Ms. Cooke. "Since 1978, it's been three or four times a year. Then I spent the year before last in Washington on a fellowship at the Hirschhorn. I've traveled a lot. And now American artists travel a lot, too."</p>
