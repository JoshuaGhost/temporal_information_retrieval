        <p>The water alert on City Island, off Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, was lifted yesterday afternoon after a second day of tests by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection showed the disappearance of a bacterial contamination that had been detected earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Since last Thursday, the island's 4,000 residents had been under a warning by city health and environmental officials not to drink tap water without boiling it first. Routine tests had earlier found E. coli bacteria, which occurs in human and animal feces, at levels above what the state considers safe.</p>
        <p>No illness attributable to the contaminated water was reported to city officials. The bacteria can cause gastrointestinal ailments with flu-like symptoms, and urinary-tract infections.</p>
        <p>The cause of the contamination remains unclear, but the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Albert F. Appleton, said the most likely cause was a combination of warm weather and City Island's location at the end of a water-distribution line.</p>
        <p>He explained that water is more likely to stagnate on City Island than in other areas of the city because the island lies on the end of a water line. He added that warm temperatures combined with less water flow reduced the effectiveness of chlorination.</p>
        <p>As a precaution, the Department of Environmental Protection will test City Island's water daily for the next week or two.</p>
