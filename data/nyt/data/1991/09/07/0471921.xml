        <p>Fighting has broken out anew in Liberia and along the Sierra Leone border involving troops from three West African nations and rival guerrilla groups, according to reports today.</p>
        <p>President Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone told the British Broadcasting Corporation that a joint force from his country, Nigeria and Guinea recaptured a key border bridge from fighters of the Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Momoh denied his Government was arming a new faction of exiled Liberians who crossed the Mano River Bridge and attacked Tienneh, a town 70 miles northwest of Monrovia, the capital.</p>

        <p>Fighting has broken out anew in Liberia and along the Sierra Leone border involving troops from three West African nations and rival guerrilla groups, according to reports today.</p>
        <p>President Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone told the British Broadcasting Corporation that a joint force from his country, Nigeria and Guinea recaptured a key border bridge from fighters of the Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Momoh denied his Government was arming a new faction of exiled Liberians who crossed the Mano River Bridge and attacked Tienneh, a town 70 miles northwest of Monrovia, the capital.</p>
        <p>Like most of Liberia outside of Monrovia, it is behind Mr. Taylor's lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Momoh also denied that the Liberian group, mainly remnants of the army of the slain President Samuel K. Doe who fled into Sierra Leone, were fighting alongside his soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor heard Mr. Momoh's interview and called the BBC with his version of events. He said his fighters recaptured the bridge today, fought back the exiled rebels and advanced into Sierra Leone.</p>
