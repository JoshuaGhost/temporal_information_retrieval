        <p>TONY GWYNN, bothered by a sore left knee, was cleared yesterday to resume action up to his tolerance. But team doctors said the San Diego Padres right fielder might need post-season arthroscopic surgery to clean the joint.</p>
        <p>Gwynn, the National League's leading hitter at .325, underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test Thursday afternoon. Results showed no problem with the medial meniscus cartilage in his left knee, Dr. JAN FRONEK said yesterday. Gwynn was available to pinch-hit last night against the Cardinals, and will be evaluated daily.</p>

        <p>Gwynn, the National League's leading hitter at .325, underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test Thursday afternoon. Results showed no problem with the medial meniscus cartilage in his left knee, Dr. JAN FRONEK said yesterday. Gwynn was available to pinch-hit last night against the Cardinals, and will be evaluated daily.</p>
        <p>Gwynn injured the knee when he slid hard into second base Aug. 5 at Houston. He was forced out of a game Aug. 30, and last Saturday had the knee drained and received a cortisone shot. He returned Tuesday night and went 2 for 4 against the Cubs, but hasn't played since. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
