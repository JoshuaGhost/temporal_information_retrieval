        <p>FROM USAIR'S GLASS-ENCLOSED TOWER, Greater Pittsburgh International Airport seems asleep. Nearly 40 airliners nuzzle quietly along wharflike terminals, like giant, docile porpoises. The planes are taking on passengers, but the tower crew can't see the activity. What is visible through the tower's panoramic windows at 4:30 P.M. on a busy weekday is a vast, empty airfield.</p>
        <p>But then the porpoises, twin-engined DC-9's and Boeing 737's, come alive. At 4:35, the first backs away from the terminal. "Gate One is pushing," says Kim Hunter, the young tower chief. In minutes, more than 30 planes are under way. Swarming and mingling, they seem almost to greet each other before falling gradually into line and taxiing to the runways. A USAir fleet is departing, and for the fifth time since early morning a deserted airport becomes a congested one.</p>

        <p>FROM USAIR'S GLASS-ENCLOSED TOWER, Greater Pittsburgh International Airport seems asleep. Nearly 40 airliners nuzzle quietly along wharflike terminals, like giant, docile porpoises. The planes are taking on passengers, but the tower crew can't see the activity. What is visible through the tower's panoramic windows at 4:30 P.M. on a busy weekday is a vast, empty airfield.</p>
        <p>But then the porpoises, twin-engined DC-9's and Boeing 737's, come alive. At 4:35, the first backs away from the terminal. "Gate One is pushing," says Kim Hunter, the young tower chief. In minutes, more than 30 planes are under way. Swarming and mingling, they seem almost to greet each other before falling gradually into line and taxiing to the runways. A USAir fleet is departing, and for the fifth time since early morning a deserted airport becomes a congested one.</p>
        <p>Nothing so stands out as the hallmark of airline deregulation -- the removal of Government controls over routes and fares -- than these surges of activity that all but overwhelm even the largest airports at certain times, only to fade to eerie quiet at others. Since deregulation became law in 1978, the airlines have put together their own version of a mass transit system that moves more planes to more places more frequently than anyone ever imagined. From 29 "hub" airports across the nation, the airlines send out fleets of aircraft, draw them back and quickly send them out again to "spoke" towns and cities, generating more than 14,000 domestic flights a day.</p>
        <p>But not without considerable pain for consumers, and for many of the airlines themselves. Witness the near death this summer of that pioneer of commercial aviation, Pan American World Airways, which lacked the foresight and resources to develop the hub operations essential to profitability in today's airline industry. The hub-and-spoke system that has dominated air travel since the mid-80's was never envisioned by the authors of deregulation; it evolved only after a handful of major airlines discovered that by controlling the flow of traffic in and out of large, strategically placed airports, they would gain much of the same power over routes and fares that the Government once exercised.</p>
        <p>Spewing out flights in every direction, the hub-based mass transit system is not, by nature, user-friendly. The graceful rhythms of a fleet departure, so arresting a sight from USAir's traffic control tower, are lost on passengers squeezed into narrow seats inside an airliner that's been stuck for more than a quarter of an hour on the Tarmac.</p>
        <p>Such irritations have undoubtedly contributed to the erosion of public support for deregulation that the Roper Organization, in its national opinion polls, has found over the years. A decade ago, only 17 percent of Americans polled expressed dissatisfaction with deregulation and supported more Government controls. That figure rose to 36 percent last October. Most of the increase came in the mid-80's, just as the hub airports were coming into their own.</p>
        <p>"The biggest complaint is delays, and two-thirds of these are weather-related," says Cornish Hitchcock, legal director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project in Washington. With the hub-and-spoke system, a local rainstorm can have a ripple effect. "You can be sitting in Chicago, waiting for a flight to Boston," he says, "and you are told that the aircraft you are supposed to take hasn't reached Dallas, much less Chicago, because it is raining in Phoenix."</p>
        <p>Even on this cloudless June afternoon in Pittsburgh, an ideal flying day, the USAir fleet is experiencing the kind of nettlesome delays that Department of Transportation data show to be endemic to the world of hub and spoke. One late arrival from Los Angeles, Flight 82, is disrupting operations, threatening to make not only its own pasengers late, but also hundreds of others.</p>
        <p>Flight 82 is 28 minutes behind schedule, and nearly half of its 102 passengers have paid for seats on more than 20 connecting flights, six of which are now forced to delay their departures. Through the radio chatter in the tower, Hunter keeps abreast of Flight 82's passengers hurrying through the terminal and of baggage handlers rushing to transfer suitcases to waiting planes.</p>
        <p>A DC-9 bound for Norfolk is the first of the laggards to cast off, having picked up two of the Los Angeles passengers. Three other travelers now board a plane to Buffalo, three more take a connecting flight to Newport News, Va., and two more to Syracuse. A flight to Erie, Pa., which waits for 10 passengers from the Los Angeles flight, is still boarding them and their luggage 15 minutes past its departure time. Hunter considers releasing the plane, which would leave some ticket holders, or their bags, stranded. "You tend to be more liberal late in the day, because you don't want people stuck here overnight," she says, deciding to stretch the deadline. The Erie flight finally rolls off at 5 o'clock -- 20 minutes behind schedule for a 38-minute flight.</p>
        <p>THE GREAT PROMISE OF AIRLINE deregulation -- vigorous competition among numerous carriers that would keep fares low -- is fading. The system was supposed to provide travelers with a buyer's market of choices in airlines, flights and fares, and, in fact, there</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>more flights now than before deregulation. But a much lower percentage of them are nonstop, adding hours and stress to many trips. Even a short 316-mile flight from Birmingham, Ala., to New Orleans normally requires an almost absurd detour to a hub -- a plane change in Atlanta, Memphis or Nashville that turns a trip of less than one hour's flying time into a four-hour odyssey. The trade-off for these inconveniences was supposed to be lower fares, but they, too, are beginning to disappear.</p>
        <p>Passengers are not the only ones who have suffered under deregulation. Continental, T.W.A., Midway and America West, all once prosperous carriers, are either operating in bankruptcy or very close to it. A fifth, Eastern, died in January, and Pan Am has greatly shrunk, having sold off most of its remaining routes to Delta. More than ever, the danger exists that the airline industry could "collapse into a tight little oligopoly, controlled by a handful of firms," Kenneth M. Mead, director of transportation issues for the General Accounting Office, told a House committee recently. But the oligopoly is already here. Today, five airlines -- American, United, Delta, Northwest and USAir -- dominate air travel in the United States, handling 71 percent of all the traffic and, like ward bosses, controlling 21 of the nation's 29 hub airports.</p>
        <p>Twice before in the 70-year history of commercial aviation, the airlines have undergone consolidation. The first round was in the 1920's, when the United States Post Office awarded rich mail-carrying contracts to a few airlines, choosing from among the numerous tiny companies that were competing for a foothold. A second contraction was set in motion after a political scandal ended the Post Office's power to subsidize airlines. But the Roosevelt Administration soon created the Civil Aeronautics Authority, later renamed the Civil Aeronautics Board, to divvy up routes and set uniform fares.</p>
        <p>The act of deregulation was a new wrinkle. With high inflation plaguing Americans in the 1970's, the airlines and the bureaucratic C.A.B. had become lightning rods for public wrath. In another era, the solution might have been Federal subsidies to lower fares. But laissez-faire economics was all the rage, and the answer that emerged, pushed by President Carter himself, was a wide-open marketplace. The theory was that this would produce many new airlines and much fare cutting, which would provide Americans not only with cheaper air travel but also lower inflation.</p>
        <p>The cheap travel and numerous new airlines did, for a while, materialize. But in time, the major airlines, groping for ways to eliminate the new competition, came up with the hugely expensive hub system, which effectively shut out the young, underfunded challengers. Virtually all the small airlines born in the early years of deregulation, including People Express, New York Air and Capitol, soon died off -- a graveyard of nearly 200 in 13 years.</p>
        <p>ONCE AIRLINE ROUTES WERE STRAIGHT LINES between cities drawn by the Government, but today they are designed by the airlines themselves, radiating like the ribs of an umbrella from hub airports. And whatever changes deregulation brings next, the hub-and-spoke system seems certain to be with us for a very long time. Despite the congestion and the passenger inconveniences, no one is pressing to do away with what is, from the airlines' viewpoint, a wonderfully efficient setup. The endless flights from outlying cities to a hub and then out again help fill seats and keep planes constantly in use -- increasing revenues.</p>
        <p>"When you have 20 people from some small city going to 20 different destinations, you can put them all on one plane, fly them to a hub like Pittsburgh and then scatter them," says David A. Swierenga, an assistant vice president of the Air Transport Association of America, the airlines' trade group.</p>
        <p>The hubs are also labor saving. One shift of USAir employees -- including Hunter's tower crew, ticket agents, baggage handlers, mechanics and supervisors -- handles not only the late afternoon fleet and its horde of passengers, but four other incoming and outgoing fleets: a total of nearly 200 flights.</p>
        <p>Then there is the leverage that an airline, monopolizing a hub, exercises over local passengers. More than 30 percent of the travelers passing through Pittsburgh International, for example, begin or end their journeys in that city. Since USAir handles 85 percent of the traffic into and out of the airport, these passengers find themselves forced to pay ticket prices well above average. The same is true of most of the other hubs, where local customers end up paying premium fares -- roughly 10 to 15 percent above the norm.</p>
        <p>"The real payoff in operating a hub airport," says Severin Borenstein, an economist specializing in the airline industry at the University of California at Davis, "comes from the travelers who either begin or end their journeys at the hub."</p>
        <p>The nonlocals, those merely changing planes at a hub, can bargain better. If USAir seems to charge too much to go from, say, Akron, Ohio, to New York's LaGuardia Airport via Pittsburgh, there are other routes, via other hubs. You can take a Delta commuter plane into that airline's Cincinnati hub, then fly to New York in a Delta jet; or grab a Northwest flight to Northwest's Detroit hub and from there make a direct connection to LaGuardia. Luring travelers through their hubs is the main thrust of competition among the airlines.</p>
        <p>Tellingly, that competition never reaches the point of trying to take over a rival's hub. When American sought one in North Carolina several years ago, rather than going through the expense and energy of trying to dislodge USAir from that airline's Charlotte hub, it went the easier route by centering its operations in nearby Raleigh-Durham. (The few cases in which airlines share a hub -- American and United at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, United and Continental at Denver's Stapleton Airport, Delta and Northwest at Boston's Logan Airport and American and Delta at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport -- are largely holdovers from pre-deregulation days.) "The airlines compete between their hubs, not at them," says Patrick V. Murphy Jr., Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>YET DESPITE THE NUMEROUS flights through the different hubs, it is not always easy to get an affordable seat. Those passengers who pay full price in coach or first class, spending more than in the days before deregulation, have quick and unlimited use of the system. But the great majority of passengers purchase discount tickets, which restricts their access to flights. It would be the same if subway riders could buy half-price tokens that would be valid only for every fourth or fifth train that enters the station. "You are paying a premium for the right to travel anytime you want," says Barbara R. Amster, vice president for ticket pricing at American Airlines.</p>
        <p>But discount tickets aren't the bargain they once were, either. Gone is the wild fare-cutting, when a People Express offered a $99 one-way, coast-to-coast ticket and others matched the rock-bottom price. Today, the New York-Los Angeles fare rarely drops below $200. And while airline tickets -- full fare and discount combined -- cost substantially less now, on average, than in 1978, the low point came in 1987. Since then, fares have been inching up.</p>
        <p>Newspaper ads still herald eye-popping bargains, of course, but they usually don't last long, and the restrictions can be daunting. Passengers are often obliged to purchase tickets at least seven days in advance, to buy round trip (with no refund for cancellation), to travel in the early morning or late afternoon, to stay over Saturday night, to use their tickets by a certain date and, most important, to change planes -- sometimes doubling or even tripling the length of a journey.</p>
        <p>This proliferation of rules limits the number of tickets sold and the pressure on competing airlines to match the bargains. "Fares may not rise," says Julius Maldutis, an airline industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, "but the availability of discounts will shrink, and the size of the discounts will also shrink."</p>
        <p>THE AIRLINES ARE, IN FACT, DILIGENTLY working toward this goal. Their method is called yield management, a formidable computerized system of frequently repricing seats on every upcoming flight until the day the plane departs. Barbara Amster, vice president for ticketing at American Airlines, is a master of the game.</p>
        <p>Amster, 44, was born and raised in New York City. Starting as a reservations clerk 24 years ago, she moved up American's ranks, always selling tickets, and in 1977 was transferred south to its corporate headquarters at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Now she is seated at her office desk, examining my airline ticket. Her nasal voice and frequent staccato laugh are pleasantly scornful.</p>
        <p>"This is my kind of guy,</p>
        <p>all right</p>
        <p>," she says, noting that I had paid $530 -- full coach fare -- to fly from New York to Dallas on American. "We'll definitely bring you a cup of coffee."</p>
        <p>Her secretary does, also in good humor. I had purchased my round-trip ticket eight days in advance. At the time, the computers had shown $530 to be the least expensive fare available on such short notice for a nonstop flight. But a day or two later, having not sold enough seats, Amster's staff opened up some places at $466, requiring only three days' advance purchase. I was out $64.</p>
        <p>"What you should have done," Amster advises, "was purchase your ticket and get wait-listed for the three-day advance fare." Only then, she explains, would American have notified me that a cheaper seat had become available.</p>
        <p>She continues the lesson. American has 2,450 jet departures a day. Each flight averages more than 12 different published fares, whose availability is juggled constantly. A businessman traveling from Austin to the Dallas-Fort Worth hub might be told that no seats are available on his chosen flight, even at full coach fare. But a vacationer on the same flight to Dallas who is then going on to New York -- or, better yet, London -- has no problem getting a seat. Even with an excursion fare, the vacationer is paying far more for his long journey than the business traveler making the one-hour hop to Dallas.</p>
        <p>"I have to see how many people I can get to give me the most money," Amster says. Then, leaning across her desk, she draws a diagram, dividing the 190 seats on a Dallas-to-New York flight into various groups. Fifteen are assigned a "yield," or value, of $600 apiece, 15 more of $400 and so on down the scale to about $100. The traveler from Austin-to-Dallas-to-New York is paying enough to be assigned a $400 value on the Dallas-New York leg.</p>
        <p>There are other tricks in Amster's bag. Sixty days before the flight, the greatest demand is for the lowest excursion fares, but few are put up for sale. "You don't want to sell too many of these and lose the higher-paying traveler who books late," she says.</p>
        <p>Forty days before a flight, a traveler might be told that a $268 round-trip excursion fare, requiring 30 days' advance purchase, is sold out. He then buys a higher-priced discount ticket, paying, say, $318. But five days later, the anticipated demand for more expensive seats has not surfaced, and the $268 fare goes back on sale. Early planning results in a $50 loss.</p>
        <p>"If we are too optimistic about selling the expensive seats, we lose sales at the $400 level," Amster says. "But I'd rather lose those than the $600 seats."</p>
        <p>MARCHING TO THIS strategy, the airlines change fares 80,000 times every day, and slowly their revenues seem to be rising. Five years ago, average revenue paid by each passenger on the nation's airlines had fallen to 11.08 cents a mile from 12.74 cents in 1981. These were the go-go years when People Express, New York Air and other newcomers were selling all their seats at bargain prices. The explosion of cheap air travel made folk heroes of entrepreneurs like Donald C. Burr, founder of People Express. Frank A. Lorenzo, whose New York Air slashed shuttle fares in the Northeast, was also acclaimed, until his bitter struggles with the unions at Eastern cast him in the role of villain.</p>
        <p>After initially attempting to match the challengers, the established airlines stumbled on yield management. They found that by offering a relatively small number of low-priced seats, they were able to lure away enough passengers to put the upstarts out of business, which they did in the mid-80's. Since 1986, revenue per passenger mile has steadily risen to an average of more than 13 cents, despite the problems that beset the industry during the recession and the Persian Gulf crisis.</p>
        <p>But the new stability in revenues came too late for some airlines. The problems of Eastern, Pan Am, T.W.A., America West and Midway -- high debt, lack of capital, inadequate equipment or bad management -- have crippled their chances to play the hub-and-spoke game against the big airlines.</p>
        <p>"It is unfortunate that people are being hurt," says Clifford Winston, an airline expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington and a passionate advocate of deregulation. "But this happens in free markets. The least efficient drop out."</p>
        <p>IN THIS LATEST chapter in commercial aviation history, American, United and Delta have become the most powerful, their fleets blanketing the country. More and more, their planes are also coming and going from abroad. The big three are rapidly adding flights to Europe, the Far East and Latin America, purchasing overseas routes from T.W.A. and Pan Am, taking over their roles as the nation's principal overseas carriers. Above all, the expansion abroad helps fill flights within the United States. A resident of Wichita, Kan., or Oklahoma City, traveling to London, is likely today to fly American into its Dallas-Fort Worth hub and then cross the Atlantic on that airline's nightly flight from Dallas.</p>
        <p>The frequent-flyer programs offered by American, United and Delta -- the most comprehensive in the industry -- are another weapon that assures their domination. Once a customer accumulates enough miles, the big three offer a much greater variety of trips in this country and abroad than other airlines. "We can't offer the world and that hurts us," says Edward R. Beauvais, chairman and founder of America West, an eight-year-old airline whose operations are concentrated in the West. It filed for bankruptcy in June to avoid paying creditors.</p>
        <p>Another big advantage for American and United is that they own or control the two computer reservation systems most used by travel agents to book flights. (Eighty-five percent of all reservations are made through travel agents.) While every airline's flights and fares are listed in each giant system (called Sabre and Apollo), control gives American and United an edge in getting agents to steer customers their way. Among other things, the two airlines give free use of Sabre and Apollo to agents who book a minimum number of flights. Just using the computer terminals to make reservations on airlines other than American and United is harder, requiring more key strokes.</p>
        <p>But of all the muscles the big three can flex, perhaps the biggest -- and most worrisome to smaller competitors -- is overseas expansion. It is of particular concern to Edwin I. Colodny, chairman of USAir, which has only a handful of overseas flights. Under Colodny, now 65, USAir grew from a regional carrier in the Northeast, called Allegheny, to a national one, renamed USAir, that expanded and prospered by acquiring faltering airlines.</p>
        <p>But Colodny concedes that USAir might not be strong enough to make the next big leap necessary to survival in the age of deregulation -- the acquisition of overseas routes. While the big three battled until mid-August over what was left of Pan Am's global network, USAir, despite flourishing hubs in Pittsburgh and three other cities, lacked the huge capital to get into the bidding. "Ultimately," Colodny says, "USAir might have to ally with a foreign airline, or be acquired by one of the big American carriers."</p>
        <p>AT THIS JUNCTURE IN the deregulation sweepstakes, American Airlines looks like the biggest winner, enjoying greater prosperity than even United or Delta (in spite of the latter's expansion with the purchase last month of many Pan Am routes). So it is no surprise that one of the country's most tireless boosters of airline deregulation is American's 55-year-old chairman, Robert L. Crandall. With his strong hands, rugged face and slightly off-center nose, Crandall could easily be mistaken for a mechanic from his own airline. But his bluntness and zeal have made him the industry's most visible spokesman.</p>
        <p>"There is a great debate brewing that is solidly rooted in misunderstanding and misinformation," Crandall says, sitting in his office at the company's Dallas-Fort Worth headquarters. "It has to do with the supposition of a good many people that in order to have competiton you have to have 15 domestic airlines. In fact, 15 domestic airlines would create less competition than three domestic airlines."</p>
        <p>Superairlines are necessary, Crandall asserts, to reduce overcapacity (four out of every 10 seats go unfilled) and to go head-to-head with well-heeled, often Government-subsidized foreign carriers in international competition. The corollary to this argument is that the United States Government, in assigning overseas routes, should give preference to American, United, Delta and Northwest.</p>
        <p>There is an arrogance to Crandall's line of thinking, but also a logic. The major airlines operate on very small profit margins, even in good times, and so far this year they have lost billions of dollars to war-related fuel increases and travel declines. To assure profits, Crandall says, fares must rise about 6 percent above present levels. And to make possible these higher fares, the industry inevitably will have to shrink.</p>
        <p>"Fares have to go up," says Crandall, voicing a sentiment that few airline executives would disagree with. "If the public wants to have an airline industry at all, and if the public wants new airplanes and safe airplanes and adequate terminals, they have to be paid for."</p>
        <p>The Crandall philosophy is loaded with irony. His prescription for the industry -- fewer airlines and higher fares -- was precisely what airline deregulation was intended to eliminate. Moreover, opponents of deregulation, like Paul S. Dempsey, a transportation expert at the University of Denver, see nothing but rising fares on the horizon. "We know the survivors will be rational wealth maximizers inclined to raise fares to super levels," he says.</p>
        <p>In pursuit of more passengers and higher fares, Crandall has violated a taboo within his industry that is decades old: selling safety. In the July issue of American Way, the airline's magazine, Crandall insinuated that the big airlines were safer than the smaller ones because they could afford the required maintenance.</p>
        <p>But Anthony J. Broderick, the F.A.A.'s associate administrator for regulation and certification, contends that American and the other large carriers have accident records that are virtually indistinguishable from those of the smaller airlines. For the industry as a whole, fatalities have dropped to all-time low levels over the last 15 years, in part because new computer monitoring technology has made aircraft more reliable.</p>
        <p>The safety issue is complicated, however. The hubs themselves push acceptable safety limits when fleets converge on airports, increasing the stress on pilots and air traffic controllers. With planes coming in only 30 seconds apart, controllers sometimes find themselves rapidly issuing instructions to five or six approaching aircraft, never knowing for sure if their messages have been received.</p>
        <p>Kit Darby, a co-pilot for United, has experienced these bursts of instructions many times. "It would be nice if they would give you time to repeat the information back to them," he says. "In my plane, there are three of us listening to check what we thought we heard with each other."</p>
        <p>HISTORY HAS inscribed Alfred E. Kahn as the father of airline deregulation. As chairman of the C.A.B. under President Carter, he was the man who led the dismantling of the Government's power to award routes and set fares. But Kahn, now 73 and living near Ithaca, N.Y., acknowledges that the system he wrought is idiosyncratic and perhaps drifting dangerously off course.</p>
        <p>Kahn likes to tell the following story: Three years ago, he received an invitation from his old boss. "President Carter invited the people who had worked with him down to lunch in Atlanta on a Monday," he recalls, "and I wanted to go and come back on the same day. It was $560 round trip. So my travel agent got me two discount round-trip tickets, each requiring a weekend's stayover, and I threw away the two extremes and the trip cost me only $355." (Half of one round-trip ticket permitted him to fly to Atlanta on the chosen Monday morning; the other ticket's return leg allowed him to fly home that afternoon.)</p>
        <p>Would Kahn go back to regulating fares? No, he replies. He still favors allowing the marketplace to set ticket prices, although he acknowledges that the process breeds confusion, inequities and annoyances among consumers. "I cannot deny the increased resentment of passengers," he says, "not only at the stopovers, but at the proliferation of fares and how much harder it is to be a good shopper today. And the crowding."</p>
        <p>But, says Kahn, that's the way the system is supposed to work. The theory is, you get what you pay for. It's the old tradeoff of uncomfortable travel for low fares. What bothers Kahn is that this old tradeoff, which seemed to thrive in the early years of deregulation, is now skewed. Discounts are less abundant, but discomforts aren't.</p>
        <p>Kahn, in part, blames the Reagan and Bush Administrations. "A Government sensitive to predatory pricing might have helped retain more competition in the form of more airlines," he says. Antitrust laws, Kahn argues, should have been invoked. "If I were in charge of the antitrust division," he says, "I would damn well see if I could build a case that yield management is predatory pricing."</p>
        <p>So why didn't he raise the antitrust objections when he was in charge? Kahn says that in the fall of 1978, just before airline deregulation officially started, he became concerned about the potential for damaging mergers. While vacationing with his wife in Venice, he drafted a memo outlining his fears. But after Kahn returned to Washington, President Carter pulled him out of the C.A.B., which would be slowly dismantled over the next few years, and put him in charge of fighting inflation as chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability.</p>
        <p>"I never was able to follow up," Kahn says, a little wistfully. "It is hard for anyone who was not there at the time to appreciate the way in which the forces began to take on a momentum of their own."</p>
        <p>FOR ALL OF deregulation's problems, no one in official Washington has yet called for a return to full-scale Government regulation. But some would at least take the rough edges off deregulation. Under a bill now before the House, life would become easier for the faltering airlines. They would have more access to landing slots at the airports of their competitors and more leverage over the computer reservation systems controlled by American and United. In addition, the reassignment of overseas routes, now dominated by the big three, would be supervised by the Government to insure that the smaller airlines got a bigger share. Finally, the legislation would permit foreign carriers to own up to 49 percent of a United States airline's voting stock, if that airline was in danger of failing for lack of capital. The current limit is 25 percent.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, recognizing that a few foreign airlines already have major investments in American carriers (among them, KLM in Northwest, S.A.S. in Continental), strongly supports an increase in foreign ownership up to 49 percent. But the Administration shows signs of going a step further, allowing foreign carriers to operate routes within the United States itself. It is not far-fetched to envision British Airways someday flying direct from New York or Chicago to St. Louis, even taking over T.W.A.'s big hub there if that airline goes under.</p>
        <p>Some Administration officials foresee American carriers making similar inroads abroad, particularly as deregulation takes hold in Europe and the Far East. "I believe that the airlines of the future will be multinational companies," Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner says. "They will operate in each other's countries, like many manufacturing corporations do today."</p>
        <p>Skinner draws an analogy with the auto industry. Just as General Motors and Ford have big manufacturing operations in Europe, and as Nissan, Honda and Toyota have factories in the United States, so airlines would set up shop around the globe.</p>
        <p>But airlines aren't auto manufacturers. Building and selling cars in the United States is a penny-ante proposition compared with the gigantic costs of establishing a hub here, when the best hub cities are already taken. Acquiring American carriers, like T.W.A. or USAir, might be the least troublesome and least costly means of a foreign airline's gaining entry.</p>
        <p>But what if Congress doesn't buy the idea? Without the intervention of foreign airlines -- or some Government regulation to protect the weaker carriers -- airline industry contraction seems destined to continue. "Eventually," says the University of California's Severn Borenstein, "the number of major airlines might be reduced to just a few, or possibly even one."

        <p>A picture caption in The Times Magazine last Sunday with an article about the airline industry misidentified the airport in which passengers were shown waiting. They were at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, waiting for an American Airlines flight, not the Pittsburgh airport, waiting for a USAir flight.</p>
