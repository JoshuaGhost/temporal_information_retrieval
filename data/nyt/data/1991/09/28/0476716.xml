        <p>Success is threatening to undermine the European Community. Even before the establishment of a single market, the community has proved an irresistible magnet, playing an important role in the breakdown of the Soviet Eastern European empire. It provided the contrast showing how badly Communism failed.</p>
        <p>But now, old suspicions simmer between France and Germany. An interlude of "Europhoria," which replaced the fear of "Eurosclerosis" of the mid-1980's, has given way to another bout of rival jousting.</p>
        <p>The long argument over "widening" (admitting more members) versus "deepening" (building stronger institutions) has been superceded.  Events moved too fast in the East.</p>
        <p>It is now generally accepted that Western applicants can't be excluded much longer, and that Easterners have to be given solid hope for admission when their economies are up to the challenge. President Francois Mitterrand's comment that this would take "decades and decades" boomeranged and was considered an intolerable rejection of the East's appeal for a European embrace.</p>
        <p>So the new issue is how fast and far the 12 existing members are willing to go to establish a core firm enough not to be diluted by many newcomers, perhaps as many as another dozen, including ex-Soviet republics. The deadline is December, when two new treaties are to be signed.</p>
        <p>The one on economic and monetary union is almost over the hump after a harsh struggle. A compromise provides for a single treaty on a common currency and a central bank, but leaves each country the choice of starting operations by the end of 1996 or joining later. It's a typical E.C. compromise; the laggards, almost surely including Britain, can be left behind without being left out.</p>
        <p>Even so, voices in France are complaining that the French economy can't take so much dependence on Bonn, although Paris wants rapid consolidation to tie the Germans westward. High interest rates dictated by the mark, they say, are prolonging recession.</p>
        <p>The other treaty, on political and security union, is more decisive on whether there ever will be a united Europe, and in much more trouble. Britain adamantly opposes including even a mention of federation as the ultimate target.</p>
        <p>The quarrels over institutional powers come down to whether the nation-state remains the bedrock of the European system, just when nationalism is flourishing again in the East. The division of Europe helped drive the West to pool some sovereignty, the impressive results broke down the wall, and this triumph is sapping the compulsion to unite.</p>
        <p>True, tough fights and last-minute agreement are typical of the E.C. There is a momentous push to acknowledge the benefits of integration, which has made war among community members unthinkable. It can again counter the shove of irrepressible national egotism if politicians take a deep breath.</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia has become the new bogyman, proof of what can happen when emotion and pressure for rival advantage overwhelm the common interest. Countries like Czechoslovakia fear a contagious example. The West remembers the Balkan powder keg and how it could blow up Europe.</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia demonstrates E.C. impotence and divergence on foreign policy. Mr. Mitterrand warned against reverting to the disastrous "game of alliances," when Europeans pursued separate interests and stumbled into war. This persuaded Helmut Kohl to hold off recognizing Croatia.</p>
        <p>The U.S. has been of two minds on European unity, supportive yet wary of losing influence. Now is a time for clear support. There won't be much chance for any world order if Europe fritters away its hope to develop capacity for common action. Historical opportunity can end with a whimper as well as a bang.</p>
