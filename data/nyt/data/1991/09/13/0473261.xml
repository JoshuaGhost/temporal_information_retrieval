        <p>Airmail</p>
        <p>The only autographed souvenir envelope known to survive from Amelia Earhart's 1937 round-the-world flight on which she disappeared is to be auctioned at 7 P.M. on Sept. 25 at Christie's in New York. Autographed by Earhart and addressed to Mr. E. H. Dimity, a parachute manufacturer who was her unofficial business promoter, the stamped flight cover is among 7,500 sold by Gimbels in Manhattan to raise money for the journey.</p>
        <p>On March 17, 1937, when Earhart left Oakland, Calif., on her first attempt to circle the globe, the envelope was in one of the mail packages aboard her plane. The plane's landing gear gave way in Honolulu, and when the plane was sent back to Oakland for repairs, the mail was returned with it. Before Earhart left again on May 21, the damaged mail packages were rewrapped under the direction of the Post Office. It was then, Elmer Dimity reported later, that he removed the envelope as part of a joke he planned to play when Earhart returned. He said he had hoped to meet her with the envelope in hand, saying the mail had arrived before she did.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Dimity sold the envelope in the 1960's on behalf of the Amelia Earhart Foundation to a dealer," said Scott R. Trepel, a Christie's consultant, who organized the auction house's sale. The collector who bought the envelope from that dealer is the unidentified seller of the Earhart memento, which is to be sold with an affidavit from Mr. Dimity. Christie's estimates that the envelope will bring $20,000 to $30,000.</p>
        <p>On the same evening, Christie's is to auction two blocks of one of the rarest United States postal stamps: the 24-cent Jenny airmail stamps from 1918 with an upside-down airplane. Issued to commemorate the new use of the Curtiss Jenny, a biplane made famous in World War I aerial dogfights, as the aircraft that would initiate the world's first airmail service, the stamp appeared on May 14, 1918, a day before the scheduled inaugural flight. It was an omen.</p>
        <p>Among the dignitaries gathered in Washington to witness the takeoff of the wooden two-seater were President Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was Secretary of the Navy. The plane did not start because the fuel tank was empty. After gasoline was siphoned from another plane, the Jenny rose and flew in the opposite direction from its destination, landing a short while later upside down in a field south of Washington.</p>
        <p>The flipped image on the Jenny stamp -- one of the best-known errors in the history of philately -- was not discovered until William T. Robey, a 29-year-old collector, bought a sheet of 100 for $24 at a Washington post office just after the issue went on sale. He sold it soon after for $15,000, and ever since these stamps have been bringing ever-higher prices. The record for a block of four Jenny stamps is $1.1 million, the price paid at Christie's in New York in 1989.</p>
        <p>Of the two examples of Jenny stamps to be auctioned next week, the more valuable one bears the initials S. De B., for Samuel De Binder, who laid out the printing plates for the upside-down Jenny stamps. It is estimated to sell for $600,000 to $800,000. The other block is expected to bring $500,000 to $700,000. An Image of Kahlo</p>
        <p>The third Frida Kahlo self-portrait from the 1940's to be auctioned in the United States in the last 16 months is to be offered at 7 P.M. Thursday at Wolf's Fine Art Auctioneers in Cleveland. Painted in 1941, shortly after the death of the Mexican artist's father, "Self-Portrait With Bonito" depicts a brooding Kahlo in black, her dark hair in braids and pulled back from her face, against a background of leaves, caterpillars and a butterfly.</p>
        <p>A year later, Kahlo sent the oil-on-Masonite study to a gallery in Mexico City, which sold it to Syrie Maugham, the British decorator, who was the former wife of the writer Somerset Maugham. Mrs. Maugham hung the painting in her Manhattan shop, where a Cleveland collector bought it in the late 1940's. He bequeathed it to his daughter, a Chicago woman who has not been identified and who is selling the painting, which measures about 21 by 17 inches. Wolf's estimates it will bring $1.5 million to $2 million.</p>
        <p>"It has a lot of things going for it, including its size," said Mary-Anne Martin, a Manhattan dealer in Latin American art. She paid $1.4 million for Kahlo's "Diego and I," a much smaller self-portrait from 1949, in a sale in May 1990 at Sotheby's in New York. "There are very few Kahlo paintings available that are this large."</p>
        <p>Since 1985, Kahlo's works have been designated part of the national patrimony of Mexico, which halted their export and propelled prices upward. Kahlo's 1947 self-portrait, three inches higher than the painting at Wolf's, brought $1.65 million at Christie's on May 15. The price was a record for Latin American art.</p>

        <p>The Auctions column in Weekend on Sept. 13 misstated the mission of the Curtiss Jenny biplane in world War I. It was used to train pilots and was never in combat.</p>
