        <p>In a host of product introductions this week, Sun Microsystems Inc. will introduce powerful new computers, Apple Computer Inc. will announce sophisticated new printers and two companies will begin to challenge the Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor business.</p>
        <p>In addition to important computer products that will be introduced this week, details of the alliance between Apple and the International Business Machines Corporation are expected to be released. The flurry of announements reflects both the opening of Seybold Publications' desktop publishing conference in San Jose, Calif., this week, and an anticipation of Comdex, the huge personal computer trade show in Las Vegas in late October. And partly it is just coincidence.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Sun, the leader in the engineering work station business, will introduce a family of powerful computers known as servers, with prices ranging from $45,000 to $104,000. Servers act as central repositories of data used by other smaller computers, which are referred to as clients.</p>
        <p>While Sun has sold servers in the past, its strength has been in individual desktop machines, which sell for $5,000 to $25,000. The Mountain View, Calif., company, months behind schedule in introducing the machines, is counting on them to enable it to continue its growth and offer a more complete line of computers.</p>
        <p>"It will allow us to attack the entire computing marketplace now, instead of just the technical," said Larry Hambly, vice president of marketing for Sun's computer hardware division.</p>
        <p>The new machines, known as the Sparcserver 600MP series, will use multiprocessing, using either two or four Sparc microprocessors to obtain greater speeds. The new servers will be available in December.</p>
        <p>Apple is introducing new laser printers and a scanner that can reproduce many shades of gray. That will make it easier to incorporate photographs into documents prepared by computers and laser printers. Experts say these features could help broaden the market for desktop publishing and help Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., stay in the forefront of that technology, which has been one of the company's strengths since the early days of its Macintosh line.</p>
        <p>While the new laser printers have the same resolution, 300 dots an inch, as Apple's previous printers, the dots can be spaced and sized in different ways to produce 67 shades of gray, simulating the output of a printer with higher resolution. Another key is the Ofoto software developed by Light Source Inc., a start-up company in Greenbrae, Calif., that automatically calibrates the scanner so that an image displayed on a computer screen or on a printed sheet closely resembles the original photograph.</p>
        <p>The Laserwriter IIf and IIg will sell for $3,600 and $4,600, respectively, though the IIf will require extra memory to reproduce shades of gray. The scanner will sell for $1,300.  Clone Chips</p>
        <p>The week will also be an important one in microprocessors. Chips and Technologies Inc. will introduce four clones of the Intel 386 microprocessor, as well as two math processors, on Monday. The San Jose, Calif., company will also introduce what is essentially a complete computer on a chip, based on the simpler 8086 processor, that will sell for $35 and be tailored to handheld computers. Gordon Campbell, chief executive of Chips and Technologies, predicted that within a year there would be a flock of I.B.M.-compatible pocket-sized computers selling for as little as $250.</p>
        <p>Chips, which is known for making chip sets -- the chips that surround the microprocessors in personal computers -- is the second company, following Advanced Micro Devices Inc., to try to break into the 386 market, which Intel protects with patents and copyrights. Chips said its new microprocessors would be faster than Intel's and would allow computer companies to add special features to their machines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell, founder and chief executive of Chips, said the company designed its chips without dissecting Intel's and designed around all Intel patents. "That makes it a little difficult for Intel to do something on the legal front," he said. Yet many analysts expect Intel to sue for patent infringement.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mips Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., will announce the price and availability of its R4000 chip, a previously announced product that is expected to be used in powerful desktop computers to be developed by the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation and other members of the so-called ACE consortium.</p>
        <p>But the most widely anticipated announcement is expected on Wednesday when Apple, I.B.M. and Motorola Inc. announce the signing of the contracts covering their strategic alliance and further details of how the alliance will work. Since the companies announced their intent to form the alliance in July, hundreds of their employees have been involved in negotiating the fine points of the deal.</p>
        <p>As reported earlier this year, Apple will use an I.B.M.-designed microprocessor in computers that will be manufactured by Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. Apple and I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., will form a joint venture to develop advanced software to control computers. It is expected they will also form a second joint venture focused on multimedia, which involves allowing computers to display images and video and reproduce sounds. The companies will also work together to allow Apple Macintosh computers to connect with I.B.M. systems in offices.</p>
