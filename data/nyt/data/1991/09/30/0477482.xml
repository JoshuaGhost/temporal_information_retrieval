        <p>Documents seized in Baghdad last week are yielding new details about Iraq's nuclear weapons program, including the names of Western companies that illegally supplied Baghdad with equipment and technology, international agency officials in Baghdad and Vienna said today.</p>
        <p>The officials refused to release the names of the suppliers, and it was unclear when or if they might be made public. Nuclear arms experts said that assembling a list of smugglers of nuclear equipment and expertise would be a major achievement in the drive to dismantle Iraq's bomb-making capacity, and one United States official called it "a top priority."</p>
        <p>But the papers have yet to resolve several important questions about the program's major focus -- the manufacture of bomb-grade, or enriched uranium -- that are causing concern among American nuclear experts, a Bush Administration official said in an interview today. Is More Hidden?</p>
        <p>Those experts question whether Iraq is still hiding an underground nuclear reactor that could be used to manufacture enriched uranium or plutonium, and whether another well-hidden installation has been built to refine enriched uranium from a uranium gas, the official said.</p>
        <p>The official said the odds that Iraq has built either are believed to be fairly low. But United States analysts cannot dismiss the prospect, he said, in light of the recent discovery that Iraq had begun to make enriched uranium with huge electromagnetic separators, called calutrons, without being detected by foreign intelligence.</p>
        <p>They also hope to learn whether Iraq has illegally bought low-grade uranium "feedstock" from foreign suppliers, an action that would have enabled scientists to speed the process of making weapons-grade uranium.</p>
        <p>China is the most likely supplier of uranium feedstock, the official said, but the Chinese have denied any involvement in Iraq's nuclear program.</p>
        <p>That official and other Bush Administration experts spoke on condition that they not be identified.</p>
        <p>Few details of the papers seized in Baghdad have reached American officials, but Administration experts said today that they believe the broad outlines of the Iraqi program are now in hand. The documents are more likely to provide details of how the Iraqis bought technology and equipment for their bomb-making effort, how that effort was organized and controlled, and what types of weapons Iraqi scientists were contemplating. 5,000 Pages</p>
        <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection team in Baghdad, David Kay, told news agencies today that the 5,000 pages of Iraqi documents include "a considerable body of data" on Iraq's nuclear program, including its organization and its overseas procurement practices.</p>
        <p>The inspection team, which was trapped in a Baghdad parking lot during a five-day dispute over the material, was to leave Iraq Monday. The documents are to be evaluated in Bahrain on Tuesday and Wednesday, an agency spokesman in Vienna told The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a senior Bush Administration official said today that the documents identify not only companies, but also foreign governments that actively assisted the Iraqi nuclear program. The official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, said he believes that the Administration will seek to make those names public.</p>
        <p>A Washington expert on weapons proliferation, Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project for Nuclear Arms Control, said that such a disclosure could deal a telling blow to weapons programs worldwide.</p>
        <p>""That network is at the disposal of Iran, Libya, Pakistan and India still," he said, adding that "the best way to close it off is to make it public."</p>
        <p>Officials of the United Nations special commission that is overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's nuclear program were said today to have many of the names of supplier companies. The United Nations will tell governments in the nations where those companies are based of the firms' activities.</p>
