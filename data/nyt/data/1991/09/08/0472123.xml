        <p>WHEN Joseph Masi's basketball coach called to tell him there would not be a team for the 1991-92 season, he thought it was a joke.</p>
        <p>"When I realized he wasn't kidding, I couldn't believe it," said Mr. Masi, a senior at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury. "My first thought was that I'm not going to play ball in my last year of school. Then I started worrying about my scholarship."</p>

        <p>WHEN Joseph Masi's basketball coach called to tell him there would not be a team for the 1991-92 season, he thought it was a joke.</p>
        <p>"When I realized he wasn't kidding, I couldn't believe it," said Mr. Masi, a senior at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury. "My first thought was that I'm not going to play ball in my last year of school. Then I started worrying about my scholarship."</p>
        <p>Mr. Masi is one of 220 students affected by the suspension of 12 teams. A loss of $2 million in state financing prompted the decision to suspend athletics for one year, said a spokeswoman for the college, Chris Capone. But juniors and seniors on athletic scholarships who stay at the college will receive the scholarships for this year, she said.  Why He Decided to Stay</p>
        <p>"When I found out that my tuition will be covered, I decided to stay," Mr. Masi, a psychology major, said. "A few other schools contacted me to play ball, but I'd have to be in college for another two years to graduate.</p>
        <p>"I'll miss the team and the travel, but I'll be able to pick up my grades. Last semester, I was in a play, and this year I might try out for a part in another one."</p>
        <p>Of those affected by the suspension, 55 are returning to New York Tech, but most are transferring or taking the year off, said the athletics director, Clyde Doughty.</p>
        <p>"It's very unfortunate that it had to come to this, and I'm disappointed for my athletes, but it was the only way that New York Tech could keep its doors open," he said. "It's not just an athletic issue, but a school issue. People in the athletic community were shocked, not only that we decided to suspend athletics but also that we are planning to make a comeback next year.</p>
        <p>"For me, this will be a busy year. It's easier to maintain than to rebuild, and it will take a lot of time and work, with the biggest problem one of public confidence."</p>
        <p>Carol Lawrence, also a senior, was one of 25 women from the West Indies on scholarships for track and field, another sport eliminated.</p>
        <p>"I knew the school was having problems, but didn't know sports would be the first to go," Ms. Lawrence said, adding that she is one of six Jamaican women who receive scholarships and will stay at the college.</p>
        <p>"Many of the other girls who are not United States citizens cannot apply for financial assistance, and without being covered by scholarships, they can't afford to stay. They are either taking a year off from school or returning to Jamaica."</p>
        <p>After thinking about transferring to a school where she could participate in track, Ms. Lawrence decided to finish her senior year at New York Tech, where, she said, she will take additional courses and play field hockey for fun.</p>
        <p>Severe losses in state aid and internal budget cuts are affecting colleges and universities across the Island. Efforts have been made to minimize the impact on academic areas, but in some colleges the elimination of athletic and academic programs and tighter scheduling have directly affected on the students.</p>
        <p>Weeks before classes the State University at Farmingdale, a two-year school, cut three programs, restaurant management, air-conditioning engineering and mortuary science.</p>
        <p>The cuts will affect 85 first-year students, a spokesman for the university, Dominick Graziani, said. Courses in the programs will be available for sophomores, and the new students will be counseled on alternative programs, he added.</p>
        <p>In addition, the number of physical-education classes was reduced and the formerly mandatory physical-education requirement has been waived.</p>
        <p>The Farmingdale students do not understand what is happening and many are disgusted, a sophomore, Joe Puccio, said.</p>
        <p>"We see larger tuition increases, and our money is getting us less than before," he said. "I was able to get the courses I needed because they're basic courses. But many of my friends had to wait a semester to get what they needed, because they found that the courses were full or discontinued. It's very frustrating."</p>
        <p>At the State University at Stony Brook, which lost $8.6 million in state financing, there are fewer classes and diminished time slots in some courses, said the vice president for finance and management, Glenn Watts. Students trying to piece together a schedule may have trouble obtaining their first choices, he said.  Some courses are being offered for one semester instead of two, and students may also have to wait until next spring before they enrolling for specific courses.</p>
        <p>It will also be more difficult at Nassau Community College in Garden City to attend desired classes at the most popular times, said a spokesman for the college, Robert Allen. Fewer classes are available, enrollments for some classes closed early, and students who registered late may find that the only available times are early mornings or evenings, Mr. Allen said.</p>
        <p>Students using services like the library and art gallery will also find hours cut, Mr. Allen said.</p>
        <p>Cuts in aid are also affecting students in all the colleges. Regents Scholarships, based on academic achievement and worth $250 a year, were eliminated. Money for the state's Tuition Assistance Program, or TAP, was also substantially cut.</p>
        <p>Leonora Merkel, a senior at Hofstra University, received more than $800 last year in scholarship and TAP money. Elimination of the Regents Scholarships and the halving of TAP financing means that she will receive about $400, she said.  Academic Scholarship Continues</p>
        <p>Another Hofstra senior, Leslie Leupold, will also lose her Regents Scholarship, but her academic scholarship remains intact, she said.</p>
        <p>"Being a private institution has helped us from feeling the effects that students in state schools are experiencing," Miss Leupold said. "No one I know saw any changes in registration or complained of any scheduling problems."</p>
        <p>At Dowling College in Oakdale, students lost a total of $450,000 in TAP money and Regents Scholarships. When Orlando Morales, a sophomore from Puerto Rico, learned that he would lose $2,000 in aid, he did not think he would be able to return to college, he said. But school officials helped him find a job as an emergency medical technician, and the job, combined with the scholarship and loans, have enabled him to return this year, he said.</p>
        <p>A Dowling senior, Eric Abney, did not know how he could afford to make up the $4,000 in aid that he lost. A job as resident adviser in a dormitory will make up at least $3,000, he said, adding:</p>
        <p>"I was lucky. Many of my friends were also affected by the cutbacks, and some couldn't return to school."</p>
        <p>At Long Island University, many students concerned about losing their state tuition assistance have had the money replaced by the college, said Karen Hay, a junior at the Southampton campus.</p>
        <p>"When I found out that I lost $1,000 of my TAP money, the college raised my study grant to cover the difference," she said.</p>
        <p>Janine DeFalco, a senior at the L.I.U. campus in Brookville and a peer counselor for first-year students, said the faculty and administration were feeling the budget cuts, but not the students. "In my theater-acting class, there are only 11 students registered, and they're still holding the course," she said. "We haven't felt any affects of the cutbacks. During the hours we have peer counseling, even the coffee and the doughnuts are still there."</p>
