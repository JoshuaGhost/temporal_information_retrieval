        <p>WITH the transformation of the Soviet Union from a monolithic superpower to a loose confederation of republics, the United States appears to be losing not only its superpower adversary, but also its post-Cold War partner in resolving international disputes.</p>
        <p>Ever since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, American diplomats had become increasingly comfortable, and in recent years almost reliant, on working with the Soviet Union to resolve regional problems from Eastern Europe to the Persian Gulf, from the West Bank to Angola.</p>
        <p>But now it seems increasingly likely that there will not be a cohesive Soviet center for Washington to work with, and even if there is, it won't be able to exercise much influence.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this should give the United States far greater freedom of action to pursue its own interests in the many parts of the world where it used to compete with the Soviet Union. But it is also becoming clear that this newfound freedom will come at a price.</p>
        <p>For one thing, it was awfully convenient in the past to deal with just one man at the top of the Kremlin; even if he was a hard bargainer, the deal he finally struck would bring along the whole Soviet empire.</p>
        <p>But the days of diplomatic one-stop-shopping are over; Washington will now have to take into account not only the Kremlin, but also the Russian republic -- or the Ukraine, Byelorussia or Kazakhstan. In addition, a further easing of the sense of shared danger emanating from Moscow is bound to leave room for more assertiveness from Paris and Berlin, London and Tokyo, whose leaders may no longer feel so impelled to fall in line under the security umbrella extended by Washington.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, this is a price American officials are more than happy to pay. The truth, American officials say, is that in recent years the so-called "partnership" with the Soviets was vastly overrated, in part deliberately by the Bush Administration. Moreover, while the way in which American diplomacy is conducted will certainly become more complex in coming years, there is every reason to believe that the remaining problems on the world stage that the United States and the Soviet Union had been working on should become easier to resolve.  'Geopolitical Massage'</p>
        <p>President Bush often exaggerated the role of the Soviets as partners in the settlement of disputes, precisely because the Soviet cooperation was being forced on Moscow by its own weakness. To make that cooperation easier for the Soviets to swallow, and for Mr. Gorbachev to sell to Soviet hard-liners, the United States constantly sought to portray the Soviets as equals -- in everything from the bargaining over terms for German reunification to the organization of a Middle East peace conference. As one American diplomat put it, Mr. Bush was constantly giving Mr. Gorbachev "a geopolitical massage." That will no longer be needed.</p>
        <p>"The main thing we needed the Soviets for they have now done, which is to collapse as a superpower," said Peter W. Rodman, who served in senior foreign policy posts in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. "Everything else is redundant. They could make problems, but they have not really had the leverage to deliver anybody for a while now. They have been cooperative because they really had no other choice."</p>
        <p>Indeed, American officials note, the Gorbachev era lasted just long enough to get the Soviet Union to cooperate smoothly on the liberation of Eastern Europe, the reunification of Germany, the settlement of the war in Angola, a resolution of the conflict in Nicaragua and the defeat of Iraq. As a result, there are few major regional issues pending any longer.</p>
        <p>In recent months, many American experts had begun asking why Washington should even bother including the Soviets any more in its diplomacy in places such as the Middle East. Wasn't it just a bad habit? After all, the Syrians agreed to take part in the American-inspired peace conference not because the Soviets twisted their arms, but because they had come to the conclusion that the Soviets were worthless as patrons and therefore Damascus needed a better relationship with Washington.</p>
        <p>As for the regional problems that still fester, American officials believe that a transfer of power from the Kremlin to the individual republics should make Soviet officials even more cooperative with the West than they have been under Mr. Gorbachev -- at least in the near future -- because the republics will be absorbed in addressing their own problems and eager to gain acceptance and financial aid from the United States. Moreover, in simple military terms, a loose confederation is ill-suited for projecting power abroad in ways that could in any manner threaten Washington's interests.</p>
        <p>All of this could have an interesting impact on one of the most important lingering regional issues, Cuba.</p>
        <p>"The three groups that were the bulwark of Castro's support in Moscow -- the K.G.B., the army and the Communist Party ideologues and apparatchiks -- were the real losers from the coup," said Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. "In the past, we repeatedly raised the Cuban aid issue with Gorbachev, and saw some movement, but he always had to contend with the strong counterpressures from hard-liners saying, 'You gave away Eastern Europe, you gave away Angola, now you are going to give away Cuba?' Well, now they aren't there any more." The Cost of Cuban Aid</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Aronson noted, any Soviet decision-making body, whether it is a weak central government or the Russian republic, will be much freer to look at Cuban aid in non-ideological terms, asking whether it is worth bartering Soviet crude oil for Cuban sugar when it amounts to an effective subsidy and incurs the wrath of Washington. Both Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev declared as much last week.</p>
        <p>So what role will there be for Soviet-American diplomatic cooperation?</p>
        <p>Clearly some collaboration will be needed to resolve lingering disputes, such as Afghanistan or Eastern European issues, but American officials expect that they will increasingly be dealing with the foreign minister not of the Soviet Union but of whatever republic is closest to the regional dispute involved.</p>
        <p>In addition, American officials say they want to avoid antagonizing allies by appearing to be the sole swaggering superpower -- and, in any event, it is always good to have partners when trying to resolve disputes on the world stage. For Washington there is an advantage in turning to a weak and malleable Soviet Union to create a patina of multilateral support, as opposed to a potentially more meddlesome and independent European Community or United Nations Security Council.</p>
        <p>Ten years from now, Mr. Rodman acknowledged, things could look very different, if the Soviets get back on their feet and a Russian nationalist policy comes to dominate the Soviet land mass. Bismarck once observed that Russia is never as strong or as weak as it appears. For Washington, however, dealing with that problem should be at least a few years down the road.</p>
