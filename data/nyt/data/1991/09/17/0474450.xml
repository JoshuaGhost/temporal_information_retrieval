        <p>The jacket is sleekly tailored and ends at knuckle level; the slender skirt is just a few inches longer. This is the basic suit look John Anthony recommends to his couture clients for daytime wear.</p>
        <p>It was a key shape in his fall show at the Americas Society in New York last week and in his salon at 60 East 66th Street. Austere and precise, the long jacket is softened by a flare or a full, rounded curve as it descends below the trim waist. The look works well on tall or short women.</p>

        <p>The jacket is sleekly tailored and ends at knuckle level; the slender skirt is just a few inches longer. This is the basic suit look John Anthony recommends to his couture clients for daytime wear.</p>
        <p>It was a key shape in his fall show at the Americas Society in New York last week and in his salon at 60 East 66th Street. Austere and precise, the long jacket is softened by a flare or a full, rounded curve as it descends below the trim waist. The look works well on tall or short women.</p>
        <p>And how long is the skirt?</p>
        <p>"I've been making clothes shorter this season than ever before," Mr. Anthony said. "My customers seem to like them that way." He thought a moment and added, "Women in their 60's like me to bring the hems down to their knees, but those in their 50's like them shorter."</p>
        <p>He carries his tailored look into evening in a clear red wool suit with satin pockets to which he adds exactly matching shoes and tights. Because of the clarity of the line and the precision of the tailoring, the effect of the all-red outfit is chic and dramatic. Mr. Anthony, who spent many years on Seventh Avenue, started doing made-to-order clothes five years ago.</p>
        <p>He makes his impact with luxury fabrics like cashmere and mohair. The red suit is one of the few exceptions to the somber vicuna, black and navy shades he prefers for both day and evening.</p>
        <p>While he softens his strict line with blouses that are draped to one side or dresses with gathered bodices and flounced skirts, his clothes never look frivolous. A high-waisted blue wool coat with a full, flaring skirt has a young, perky look, repeated in a matching cashmere dress.</p>
        <p>Stephen Knoll, who designed the models' hair styles, kept the hair "sleek and polished," to carry out the feeling of the clothes, he said.</p>
        <p>For cocktails and early evening, he offers new takes on men's dinner clothes for women. A smart outfit consists of a slender short dress with satin ribbons applied to each side as in men's dinner pants and a long double-faced wool jacket with faille lapels. A jump suit with a draped bodice is covered with another tailored jacket.</p>
        <p>A variation on his calm, controlled look is a slinky strapless long dress in forest green velvet. It has a deep flounce of gathered tulle running down one side and around the hem. It was Mr. Anthony in a fanciful mood and it brought the house down.</p>
