        <p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, one of the world's largest packaged-goods companies, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 5 percent, to $424 million, or $1.16 share, from $404 million, or $1.14 a share, in the period a year ago.</p>
        <p>Quarterly sales rose 11.1 percent, to $6.8 billion, from $6.12 billion a year earlier, mainly because of continuing strong performance overseas, especially in Europe and Japan.</p>

        <p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, one of the world's largest packaged-goods companies, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 5 percent, to $424 million, or $1.16 share, from $404 million, or $1.14 a share, in the period a year ago.</p>
        <p>Quarterly sales rose 11.1 percent, to $6.8 billion, from $6.12 billion a year earlier, mainly because of continuing strong performance overseas, especially in Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Edwin L. Artzt, Procter &amp; Gamble's chairman, said the company's domestic business "has been affected temporarily by the current economic recession, but our international business remains very healthy."</p>
        <p>The quarterly earnings, roughly in line with analysts' expectations, were hurt by a sluggish domestic economy slowed by high unemployment and lower consumer spending, analysts said. Supermarkets are stocking fewer goods because cautious consumers are buying fewer staples, like the company's Ivory soap, Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, the analysts added. Coffee Affected</p>
        <p>Lynn Hyman, a packaged-goods analyst at First Boston, said the domestic drop was evident in many products but especially in coffee, where Philip Morris's Maxwell House is competing with P.&amp;G.'s industry-leading Folgers, and cough remedies like the Vicks product line. "Sales were down because people were healthy this winter," Ms. Hyman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Artzt also said that the third-quarter earnings reflected the company's "substantial investment" in new products, especially superconcentrated versions of Tide, Cheer and other detergents. And he cited "heightened competitive activity" in the coffee business.</p>
        <p>The company's nine-month earnings rose 11.5 percent, to $1.47 billion, or $4.09 a share, from $1.32 billion, or $3.71 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the period rose 13.7 percent, to $20.3 billion from $17.87 billion.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Procter &amp; Gamble's shares slipped 87.5 cents, to $84.</p>
