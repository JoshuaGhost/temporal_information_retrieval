        <p>Grain and soybean futures swung wildly on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, charging higher at the opening, stumbling halfway through the session and recovering to a mixed finish with sme help from surging soybean meal prices.</p>
        <p>Wheat futures settled 1 1/2 to 2 cents lower, with the contract for May at $2.79 1/4 a bushel; corn futures were 1 to 2 1/4 cents lower, with May at $2.55 1/2 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher, with May at $1.24 3/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher, with May at $5.95 a bushel.</p>
        <p>Soybeans soared at the opening on Tuesday's report from a Brazilian agency that it was slashing the forecast for the country's 1991 soybean harvest. Prices later dropped after large commission firms took profits.</p>
        <p>But soybeans later climbed again on strong support from soybean meal, which surged as much as $3.50 with May at $177.40 a ton in response to extremely active trading in the Europe and on word that exporters sold about 30,000 tons, said Dan Cekander, a grain analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Corn futures gained early on expectations that United States export credits would soon be offered to the Soviet Union but fell as no word came from Washington. Prices then were buoyed by the soybean meal rally but were finally dragged down by prospects of good weather in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Wheat, following soybeans and corn, slipped amid forecasts of heavy rain in the next few days in the dry Central Plains.</p>
        <p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy futures had an erratic session that ended with slight declines.</p>
        <p>Crude oil settled 11 cents lower to 6 cents higher, with June at $20.94 a barrel; heating oil settled 0.2 cent to 0.5 cent lower, with May at 56.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline settled 0.45 cent lower to 0.01 cent higher, with May at 71.82 cents a gallon, and natural gas settled 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent lower, with June at $1.38 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
