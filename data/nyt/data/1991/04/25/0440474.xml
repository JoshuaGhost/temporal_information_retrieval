        <p>Wang Laboratories Inc. said today that it had lost $48.9 million in its third fiscal quarter. The computer company blamed the sluggish economy for hindering efforts to turn around its finances.</p>
        <p>The results for the three-month period ended March 31 compared with a loss of $146.6 million in the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Revenue for the period was down significantly to $499.7 million, compared with $593.5 million during the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Wang, which has been hurt by a computer market downturn that has hit other companies as well, has been struggling to rebound for more than a year.</p>
        <p>Wang's chairman, Richard W. Miller, said that while his company was able to report a $2.6 million profit in its first fiscal quarter, "economic and industry conditions have slowed the momentum which the company had achieved through its turnaround programs."</p>
        <p>While Wang has introduced products and strategies to generate new revenue, these sales have been outpaced by drops in the company's traditional businesses, Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Despite the losses, Mr. Miller said, Wang was in its strongest cash position in 18 months. In the most recent quarter, Wang had $194.1 million in cash or cash equivalents.</p>
        <p>Wang, which has laid off thousands of workers in recent years, said it was considering further steps to control costs but declined to say whether more layoffs might be needed.</p>
