        <p>Bywords for the Openings</p>
        <p>The season opened yesterday, and we're not talking baseball. Designers began showing their fall styles to buyers and journalists, who will decide what was fabulous and what has a reasonable chance of selling, concepts related in some mystical way everyone is trying to rediscover.</p>
        <p>You would have to be living on an asteroid not to know that the clothing business has been struggling for several seasons. Designers and industry executives say the only way out is fashion: sharp, strong new looks.</p>
        <p>"We create and fill a want, rather than a need," said Bud Konheim, the president of Nicole Miller, which holds its show tomorrow. Designers both here and abroad have been experimenting with longer lengths, which could supply needed newness.  But several fashion designers and executives said last week that hemlines were dropping just as the American woman had finally adjusted her eye to short lengths.</p>
        <p>Not everybody is hung up on newness for its own sake, and the early showings indicated that designers were focusing not so much on length -- with mostly short skirts floating away from the body -- but on fabric and style.</p>
        <p>"Anyone who tells you there's anything new in fashion is lying," Marc Jacobs, the designer for Perry Ellis, said last week. "To quote the rappers, 'Don't believe the hype.' " Now, From Massimo Vignelli</p>
        <p>"The task of design is to solve problems," said Massimo Vignelli, the graphics and furniture designer. "The task of fashion is to create problems."</p>
        <p>In this spirit, Mr. Vignelli, who has designed books, flatware, interiors and such graphics as the "D" on the D trains in the New York subway, has turned his talents to men's clothing.</p>
        <p>His first collection of lightweight wool business suits and velvet evening clothes was a response to what Mr. Vignelli called the "atrophied men's business suit."</p>
        <p>"I got to the point where I couldn't wear suits anymore," he said. "When I can't find something I need, I design it."</p>
        <p>The clothes, unconstructed jackets and elastic-waistband trousers, are designed for comfort and utility. "It's really very anti-fashion," Mr. Vignelli said. The jackets are Nehru style, with no lapels and lots of fabric in the middle to camouflage bulges.</p>
        <p>The suits, which faintly resemble the women's clothes of Andre Courreges, a designer Mr. Vignelli admires ("He was an architect, you know"), will cost about $800 to $1,000. They are to be sold in Barneys New York this summer. Circus Maximus</p>
        <p>You might think you'd look like a clown in that Geoffrey Beene or Christian Francis Roth dress, but that's exactly the point here. To see American designers at their most witty and outrageous, with no commercial considerations in mind, the "Cirque du Soleil: An Evening of Fashion," on April 18 in Battery Park City will feature circus costumes by 20 designers.</p>
        <p>The benefit performance of the French-Canadian circus will include original costumes by Badgley Mischka, Randolph Duke, Gemma Khang, Carmelo Pomodoro, Josie Natori, Charlotte Neuville, Mr. Beene and Mr. Roth. The proceeds will go to the Children's Defense Fund (for tickets: (212) 349-4266). Gigli's Spiders and Such</p>
        <p>Romeo Gigli's bug collection will be on exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Technology through April 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gigli is not an entomologist, of course, but a fashion designer, and his fall collection, shown in Paris last month, took its theme from the forest and its many crawling creatures. There were big enveloping "spider's lace" coats made from wool lace, snakelike dresses and antennae on the models.</p>
        <p>These remarkable clothes can be found in the Pomerantz Art and Design Center lobby, Seventh Avenue and 27th Street.</p>
