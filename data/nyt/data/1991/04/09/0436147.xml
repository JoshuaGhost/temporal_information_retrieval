        <p>The Israeli Defense Ministry said today that it would free more than 1,000 of the approximately 14,000 Palestinian prisoners held for actions connected with the uprising in the occupied territories. The announcement came a few hours before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived for talks on Tuesday with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.</p>

        <p>The Israeli Defense Ministry said today that it would free more than 1,000 of the approximately 14,000 Palestinian prisoners held for actions connected with the uprising in the occupied territories. The announcement came a few hours before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived for talks on Tuesday with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.</p>
        <p>A Defense Ministry statement described the prisoners as Palestinians not directly involved in violence, who had served most of their terms. An official said the action was timed for the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and was not connected with the Baker visit.</p>
        <p>"Just a coincidence," said Danny Naveh, the spokesman. "The measures have been under consideration for some time."</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the move fit into the theme being emphasized by Mr. Baker, who has been seeking confidence-building measures from Israelis and Arabs to coax peace efforts forward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naveh said the number of those to be released was higher than in the past, and he expressed hope that in easing conditions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the atmosphere for political discussion would be improved.</p>
        <p>As a further gesture, the Defense Ministry ordered tax reform in Gaza with the aim of freeing investment capital to improve economic life. The ministry said further measures, like the reopening of universities, might come next.</p>
        <p>Israelis have awaited the Baker visit in an uneasy mood influenced by what they view as America's abandonment of Iraqi Kurds rebelling against the Government of President Saddam Hussein. The American response to the Kurdish revolt has prominently figured in remarks by Cabinet members. Comments to Kurdish Jews</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister David Levy told the leader of the Kurdish Jewish population of about 100,000 in Israel, "What good is it to parachute food so they can die with their stomachs full?"</p>
        <p>The Kurdish leader, Haviv Shimoni, asked Mr. Levy to plead with Mr. Baker for American assistance to the uprising. Mr. Shimoni charged that the United States spurred the rebellion only to stand by while the Iraqi Army massacred the Kurds.</p>
        <p>Housing Minister Ariel Sharon urged the Government to impress Mr. Baker with Israel's urgent concern over "the murder of the Kurdish people now being perpetrated in Iraq, while hundreds of thousands of American and allied forces are stationed in the area of the gulf."</p>
        <p>A senior official of the Shamir Government said, "It reminds us that we live in a very bad neighborhood and can count only on ourselves." As he spoke, a television set in his office, the sound turned down, projected Cable News Network images of the misery of Kurdish refugees.</p>
        <p>Israel radio also said that Mr. Shamir, as well as Mr. Levy and Defense Minister Moshe Arens, would tell the Secretary of State that Israel would negotiate with a Palestinian delegation only if its members did not say they represented the Palestine Liberation Organization. As is customary in American dealings with this Government of strongly individualistic ministers, Mr. Baker will confer separately on Tuesday with each of the three. Will See Some Palestinians</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker is also scheduled to meet at the American Consulate in Jewish West Jerusalem with a delegation of Palestinians. However, Arabs from the occupied territories will continue to be banned from Jerusalem at least until his departure for Egypt on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Israeli statistics in mid-March said there were 10,528 Palestinians jailed for actions stemming from the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Of those, 4,221 have been convicted, 988 are charged and awaiting trial, 3,992 are being held for investigation in anticipation of charges, and 1,327 are administrative detainees.</p>
        <p>The release will not address demands by Shiite Muslim groups in Lebanon that Israel free Arab prisoners to expedite the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon. The South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia, is believed to hold about 300 Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites.</p>
