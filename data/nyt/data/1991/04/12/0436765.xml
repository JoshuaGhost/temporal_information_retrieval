        <p>Students at the City University of New York who object to proposed tuition increases vent their anger by shutting down and disrupting classes. Police who object to stalled contract talks protest by writing fewer traffic tickets. What's happened to lawful dissent in New York City?</p>
        <p>It's true that New York's budget woes are inflicting pain. But that pain is widely shared; many meritorious programs are being cut. Furthermore, tactics like seizing school buildings harm the innocent, including students who want to go to class.</p>
        <p>Gov. Mario Cuomo, facing a statewide budget gap of $6 billion, proposes cuts of $92 million in CUNY's budget. About $52 million would come from reduced student aid, faculty layoffs and program reductions. To forestall further damage to the education system, he asks for a $500 annual tuition increase for each student.</p>
        <p>Student protesters say that's too big a hit, especially on the heels of a recent $100 midyear increase. Their tactics have disrupted classes at several campuses and forced cancellation of classes at three campuses. That's not only unfair to students trying to complete their semester's work. It's a form of intimidation that runs counter to the academic community's commitment to a free and open exchange of ideas.</p>
        <p>The students have other means to advance their cause. For example, about 100,000 opponents of the increase have already sent letters to Albany. Peaceful demonstrations on city campuses or in Albany, even a meeting with Mr. Cuomo, might also be organized. Those who have ignored these peaceful but potentially effective techniques ought to be prepared to face the possible consequences of the unlawful course they have chosen: prosecution, or suspension and disciplinary action by university officials.</p>
        <p>Police officers protesting an impasse in contract talks with the city by refusing to enforce traffic rules should also be subject to discipline. Since April 1, officers have written about 80,000 fewer tickets for parking and moving violations than they did in the comparable period in March -- a drop of 54 percent. Their actions are a threat to public safety and, with $1.5 million in potential lost revenue at stake, a further threat to the city's fiscal health. Police Commissioner Lee Brown has now directed supervisors to insure that police officers perform their duties.</p>
        <p>Any citizen has a right to protest -- peacefully and lawfully. But lawless behavior that threatens the public interest calls for a swift and decisive response.</p>
