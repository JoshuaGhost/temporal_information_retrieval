        <p>A Federal judge substantially narrowed the prosecution's embezzlement and tax evasion case yesterday against the Rev. Floyd H. Flake and his wife, Margarett, and indicated that he might dismiss all charges against Mrs. Flake.</p>
        <p>The rulings and remarks from the bench by Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, who is presiding over the four-week-old trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, were so broad that jubilant defense lawyers said the case had been "gutted," apparently leaving the jury to decide only relatively minor tax charges.</p>
        <p>The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Andrew J. Maloney, whose office brought the case, said in an interview yesterday that he would "not argue with that interpretation." He said prosecutors had no regrets in bringing the case against the Flakes -- "we think it's a good case" -- but were now "considering our options." A Ministerial Account</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake, a United States Representative from Queens as well as pastor of the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church, and his wife are charged with 17 counts of conspiracy, embezzlement, tax evasion and filing false official statements. The Government contends that Mr. and Mrs. Flake evaded taxes on $228,000, which was deposited in a ministerial expenses fund that prosecutors say was a "sham" account to conceal personal expenditures.</p>
        <p>The defendants have denied any wrongdoing. Their lawyers assert that if the Flakes made any mistakes on their taxes, they were unintentional and the matter should have been resolved by the Internal Revenue Service without a criminal prosecution.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, with only one Government witness left to testify, Judge Nickerson said he was "concerned" about continuing the case against Mrs. Flake. Although she signed joint tax returns with her husband, she did not, according to the testimony, help prepare them. Few witnesses have said they even talked to Mrs. Flake about matters relevant to the case.</p>
        <p>Judge Nickerson scheduled argument for today on whether there was "sufficient evidence to hold" Mrs. Flake in the case. And he asked prosecutors to address the question of whether, if he dismisses all charges against Mrs. Flake, he must also throw out the conspiracy count against her husband, the only named co-conspirator.</p>
        <p>The prosecution's case against both the Flakes has appeared weak from the start, with all but a few of the witnesses saying they were ignorant of how the ministerial expenses fund was handled. On cross-examination, most of the witnesses, including a number who held senior positions at the Allen Church, had nothing but good to say about the 46-year-old pastor and his 42-year-old wife.</p>
        <p>In his opening statement, Mrs. Flake's lawyer, Theodore Wells, said this was "a strange case," with the "strangest" element being Mrs. Flake's indictment. Mr. Wells and Mr. Flake's lawyer, Gustave H. Newman, have speculated that Mrs. Flake was indicted only in an effort by the Government to pressure Mr. Flake into pleading guilty. Yesterday, Mr. Wells said "the entire house of cards has collapsed" for the prosecution.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Judge Nickerson indicated that prosecutors were on shaky grounds with the embezzlement and false-filing charges against the Flakes. Those charges, he said, hinged on whether the ministerial expenses fund was really a personal account of the Flakes in which all deposits were subject to taxation, as the Government asserted, or was an official church account, as the defense maintained, from which some personal expenditures might have been taxable. The evidence, the judge said, was that it was a church account.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Judge Nickerson made it formal, ruling that the fund was a church account. Because Federal law, unlike state law, does not cover embezzlement from a church account, the embezzlement and false-filing counts against the Flakes are almost certain to be dropped this week. A Defense Calculation</p>
        <p>The ruling had another devastating impact: it barred prosecutors from trying to show the jury that the Flakes had evaded taxes on all but an estimated $50,550, or 22 percent, of the $228,000 that went into the ministerial expenses fund. The $50,550 -- including allowances and Christmas and vacation bonuses -- was a defense calculation of taxable but unreported income by the Flakes between 1983 and 1988, the years covered by the indictment</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman, Mr. Flake's lawyer, estimated that under the worst of circumstances Mr. and Mrs. Flake might owe the I.R.S. $15,000. "Nobody," he said outside the court, "has ever heard of a criminal case brought over $15,000."</p>
        <p>The last prosecution witness, who was ready to take the stand yesterday, is scheduled to be an analyst from the I.R.S. But Judge Nickerson said the analyst could not testify until the prosecution removed from charts or reduced most of the figures the analyst was going to explain.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether the defense intends to call any witnesses.</p>
