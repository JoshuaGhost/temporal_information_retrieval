        <p>Since plea bargains are rarely overturned, the chances that a judge would reject a deal crafted by the Federal Government, the state of Alaska and the world's largest oil company seemed almost nil. On Wednesday, however, Judge H. Russel Holland bravely threw out the agreement ordering Exxon to pay $100 million to settle criminal charges arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</p>
        <p>He said the fines were "inadequate" and sent "the wrong message, suggesting that spills are a cost of business that can be absorbed." In effect, he told the Bush Administration to strike a tougher bargain -- which it now can.</p>

        <p>Since plea bargains are rarely overturned, the chances that a judge would reject a deal crafted by the Federal Government, the state of Alaska and the world's largest oil company seemed almost nil. On Wednesday, however, Judge H. Russel Holland bravely threw out the agreement ordering Exxon to pay $100 million to settle criminal charges arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</p>
        <p>He said the fines were "inadequate" and sent "the wrong message, suggesting that spills are a cost of business that can be absorbed." In effect, he told the Bush Administration to strike a tougher bargain -- which it now can.</p>
        <p>The original agreement ordered Exxon to pay not only criminal penalties but as much as $1 billion more in civil damages to help restore Alaska's environment. Despite obvious flaws, the settlement was praised by environmentalists and by this page as preferable to a long and chancy trial.</p>
        <p>What began to change many minds was the release on April 8 of summaries of 58 scientific studies conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These summaries suggested far greater environmental damage than originally suspected. The full studies have not been released. Nor have studies of the spill's economic costs -- which, according to some participating economists, could amount to $5 billion or more.</p>
        <p>There's no justifiable reason to keep those reports secret. The Justice Department argues that releasing the data now would weaken its case in any future trial. That argument is vastly outweighed by the data's public value -- to inform any new settlement, gauge the fairness of that settlement and, not least, help guide the restoration of Prince William Sound.</p>
        <p>The parties now have three choices: a trial, a new fine imposed by Judge Holland, which could cost Exxon as much as $600 million more, or a renegotiated plea bargain. Nobody wants a long trial. A bigger penalty would surely serve as a further, welcome deterrent to industry carelessness. But the best solution would be a tough new deal, embracing both criminal and civil penalties, that would require more up-front money than the leisurely payout provided for in the original bargain and approximate more closely the damages implied in the still-secret reports.</p>
