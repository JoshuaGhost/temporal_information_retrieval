        <p>A debt-ridden Northern California school district today became only the second school system in the state ever to seek protection in Federal bankruptcy court.</p>
        <p>The application, filed by the Richmond Unified School District with the Northern California Bankruptcy Court here, outlines the district's unmanageable finances, seeks to have the remainder of its cash spent to meet an April 30 payroll and asks the court to give the district time to reorganize and get a $29 million bailout loan from the state.</p>
        <p>Without the bailout, the district, with schools in Kensington, El Cerrito, Richmond, San Pablo, El Sobrante, Hercules and Pinole, would shut down from May 1, six weeks early, until fall.</p>
        <p>The San Jose Unified School District, the only other California district ever to petition for bankruptcy, filed in 1983 but eventually settled its labor problems and avoided going through with the process.</p>
