        <p>It was during mud season when a woman I know got her car stuck and it froze overnight. When she finally got it out, she found that the wires to the fuel pump were broken, the front wheels frozen, the brakes full of stones, and a joint in the front axle badly damaged.

        <p>During mud season, which extends roughly from early March through late April, alternating thaws and freezes combined with rain, snow and sleet turn Vermont's network of dirt roads into a treacherous, oozing wasteland.

        <p>It was during mud season when a woman I know got her car stuck and it froze overnight. When she finally got it out, she found that the wires to the fuel pump were broken, the front wheels frozen, the brakes full of stones, and a joint in the front axle badly damaged. The tow truck ripped the bumper off. The factory undercoating, she recalls, remained in the mud "like a skeleton."</p>
        <p>During mud season, which extends roughly from early March through late April, alternating thaws and freezes combined with rain, snow and sleet turn Vermont's network of dirt roads into a treacherous, oozing wasteland. It is the season of cabin fever, the season -- to crib from Joan Didion -- "of suicide and divorce and prickly dread."</p>
        <p>It is also the time of year the sap runs. This happens for a variety of botanical reasons having to do with all that thawing and freezing. Thus, many hundreds of Vermonters spend what the rest of the East Coast calls spring slogging through the woods drilling holes into trees. As a Vermont writer, Stephen Morris, recently put it: "Mud season is so hellacious, it makes the boiling of tree sap seem like fun."</p>
        <p>The boiling of tree sap is a process called "sugaring" because American Indians and early settlers didn't stop at syrup but boiled right on down to sugar, for storage purposes. (Hence the phrase "sugaring off.") Trees are tapped in maple groves, known as "sugarbushes" by men and women called "sugar makers." The sap is boiled (about 40 gallons of sap per one gallon of syrup) in wood- or oil-fired evaporators inside "sugarhouses" -- many of them lopsided little sheds with parti-colored tin roofs and tall cupolas from which billow clouds of steam.</p>
        <p>There is romance in sugaring, and lore. It's all very . . . sweet.</p>
        <p>That is, until you look beyond the quaint galvanized steel buckets hanging on the trees to the high-tech operations, with which the big commercial producers (who are not above hanging out a few buckets near the Gift Shoppe for ambiance) collect sap through miles of plastic tubing, giving the sugarbush the look of an arboreal intensive-care unit. Some of these producers now have $20,000 reverse osmosis machines, which force sap through tiny porous membranes to extract water and shorten boiling time. Some use vacuum pumps, which do not suck the sap from trees but actually lower the atmospheric pressure to induce the sap to run. They are, a researcher told me, kind of like milking machines for trees.</p>
        <p>Aggressive marketers are selling kosher maple syrup. Specialty food producers capitalize on their "Vermontness" by flavoring mustards and jams and all manner of condiments with syrup, and a Proctorsville vintner, Joseph Cerniglia, is carbonating the byproduct left from reverse osmosis and selling it as "Nouveau Sap Water."</p>
        <p>Vermont sugar makers -- who lead the nation in production -- have promoted their product in Europe, where, according to Mariafranca Morselli, a retired professor at the University of Vermont, "no one has the faintest idea what to do with it." Maple syrup, she said, is the ostensible base of a weight reduction and "purification" diet popular in Germany, Italy and France, where it is touted as coming from "the faraway forests of North America, where the Indians knew the art of extracting the sweet sap from the trees." But Morselli, who knows her syrup (she developed a carbon-dating method for detecting adulteration of the product), says the stuff is fake.</p>
        <p>In Vermont, there has never been any confusion about what to do with maple syrup. I have seen Vermonters eat it straight. David Marvin, a sugar maker in Johnson, Vt., pours it over cornflakes. Others use it in coffee. "The Official Vermont Maple Cookbook," published by the Maple Promotion Board, offers such dishes as "Beef Tongue in Sweet-n-Sour Sauce" and "Maple-Apple Ham Loaf."</p>
        <p>And then there's sugar-on-snow, which involves boiling syrup, pouring it over snow and then eating the taffylike result -- which is traditionally served with a sour pickle, a doughnut and a cup of black coffee (they say the pickle brings out the maple).</p>
        <p>There are other, more subtle ways to use maple syrup, as evidenced by the recipes below. They showcase the delicate flavor of maple, and they don't make your teeth hurt.</p>
        <p>In fact, they make maple syrup seem like a kind of redemption of mud season, Nature's sweet apology for suffering inflicted. It's almost enough. RED CABBAGE GLAZED WITH MAPLE SYRUP (From Chef Yves Labbe of Le Cheval D'Or, Jeffersonville, Vt.)  5 strips bacon, minced  1 onion, minced  1 medium firm, tart apple, peeled, cored and sliced  1 pound red cabbage (about 1/2 head), cored, outer leaves removed and remainder shredded  1 bay leaf  1/2 cup maple syrup  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. In an oven-proof saucepan or a flame-proof casserole large enough to hold all the ingredients, saute the bacon until crisp. Add the onion and saute until translucent. Add the remaining ingredients, cover and bake in the oven for 1/2 hour.</p>
        <p>Yield: Four to six servings. MAPLE-GLAZED ROAST LOIN OF PORK WITH APPLE PUREE (From Chef Jack Pickett, Ten Acres Lodge, Stowe, Vt.) 1 center-cut loin of pork (about 3 pounds) with bone attached and fat trimmed  1/4 cup cornstarch  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  8 tart, firm red apples  1 cup maple syrup  1 cup apple cider  1 cup fresh or canned chicken broth.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Place the pork on a platter and dredge well with the cornstarch. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>3. Place in a roasting pan, ribs down, and set in the oven. After 10 minutes, reduce heat to 325 degrees and brush the loin liberally with the maple syrup; reserve remaining syrup. Continue roasting, basting every 7 minutes, until the loin reaches an internal temperature of 155 degrees, about 1 1/4 hours, or until desired degree of doneness.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, wash, quarter and core the apples (do not peel). Place in a nonaluminum pan with 3 tablespoons of the remaining syrup. Cover and simmer over medium heat until apples burst and are soft, about 15 minutes. Process through a food mill or sieve and set aside.</p>
        <p>5. When the loin is done, remove from the oven and set aside on a platter. Drain the fat from the pan and pour in the broth and cider. Reduce over medium heat by half. Strain into a sauce boat.</p>
        <p>6. Serve the roast with the sauce and apple puree on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: Six servings. SPINACH SALAD WITH TEN ACRES LODGE MAPLE-MUSTARD DRESSING  3/4 cup tk oil  1/4 cup red-wine vinegar  2 cloves garlic, crushed  2 small shallots, chopped  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  1/4 cup Dijon mustard  1/4 cup Pommery mustard  1/2 cup maple syrup  Salt to taste  12 ounces fresh spinach  5 sliced mushrooms  1 red onions  4 strips maple-cured bacon, sauteed until crisp  2 hard-boiled eggs, quartered.</p>
        <p>Whisk together the oil, vinegar, garlic, shallots, pepper, mustards, syrup and salt. Place remaining ingredients in a large salad bowl and toss with the dressing.</p>
        <p>Yield: four servings.</p>
        <p>MAPLE LAMB AND EGGPLANT CURRY (From Chef Donald L. Campagna, Mary's restaurant, Bristol, Vt.)  4 ounces butter</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup soy sauce</p>
        <p>1/2 cup honey</p>
        <p>1 cup maple syrup</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon ketchup</p>
        <p>1 cup pumpkin puree</p>
        <p>1 cup red wine</p>
        <p>Dash brandy</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon nutmeg</p>
        <p>1 to 2 tablespoons curry powder (or more, to taste)</p>
        <p>3 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
        <p>3 pounds lean, boneless lamb, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</p>
        <p>1 medium red onion, diced medium fine</p>
        <p>1 large eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</p>
        <p>2 cups rice, cooked.</p>
        <p>1. In a large pot, melt the butter over low heat and whisk in the flour. Cook, whisking constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the soy sauce, honey, syrup, ketchup, pumpkin puree, wine, brandy, mustard, nutmeg and curry. Blend and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, in another large pan, heat the oil and saute the lamb and onion, until the lamb is cooked to desired degree of doneness, about 10 minutes for medium rare. Toss in the eggplant and add the curry sauce. Heat through and simmer 3 to 5 minutes, or until the eggplant loses its rawness. Serve over rice.</p>
        <p>Yield: Six to eight servings. MAPLE CREME BRULEE (From Chef Robert Fuller, Pauline's, South Burlington, Vt.)  2 cups heavy cream  1 cup maple syrup  6 egg yolks  6 to 8 tablespoons granulated sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. In saucepan, mix the cream and maple syrup together. Heat over tk heat until tk for tk minutes. Do not boil.</p>
        <p>3. In a mixing bowl, whisk egg yolks until tk. Temper with a few tablespoons of the warm cream mixtures. Pour the yolk mixture into the simmering cream and swirl together. Strain through a tk into into 6 ramekins or into an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Place ramekins or baking dish in a hot water bath and bake for 45 minutes or until set. Remove from water bath and refrigerate at least tk hours.</p>
        <p>5. Remove from the refrigerator. Evenly sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of sugar over the custard in each ramekin, or, if baking dish is used, 6 to 8 tablespoons over the entire surface. Place as close as possible to the flame and broil for 1 minute, or until sugar browns. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Refrigerate tk hours before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: Six servings. SAWMILL FARM PANCAKES  2 cups flour  2 teaspoons baking powder  1/2 cup sugar  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  3 cups milk  2 eggs  2 tablespoons vegetable oil  Melted butter  Confectioners' sugar  Maple syrup.</p>
        <p>1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, milk and eggs.</p>
        <p>2. Grease a griddle or frying pan lightly and heat over medium heat. Pour enough of the batter out to make a thin, 7-inch pancake. It will begin to bubble almost immediately. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, flip over and cook another 1 1/2 minutes. Remove to a heated platter and repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        <p>4. Brush the pancakes with melted butter and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve with maple syrup.</p>
        <p>Yield: Ten to twelve 7-inch pancakes.</p>
