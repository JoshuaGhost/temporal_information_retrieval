        <p>The National Football League teams that draft the best are the ones that judge character as well as they judge athletic talent.</p>
        <p>They are the ones who successfully look beyond the mental and physical tests and identify those college players who are coachable and bubbling with desire.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. teams that draft the worst waste thousands of dollars on scouting but are still unable to discern which athletes are on the rise.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, these teams draft on the basis of their needs when they should be picking according to the available players' ability. Sometimes, they place ability in front of need when they shouldn't be. Basic Blending</p>
        <p>In other words, they misapply these two basic theories of drafting, or aren't versatile enough to blend them at the right moment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, the teams that tend to have good drafts are blessed with that enviable intangible: luck. Teams that tend to have bad drafts seem cursed.</p>
        <p>In the draft today at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan -- the league's 56th -- each organization will be putting months of preparation to use as it seeks to build a championship team.</p>
        <p>Here, in part, are where Super Bowls are won. And although N.F.L. scouts say that the pickings in this draft are lean, it is filled with bona-fide stars at wide receiver and defensive back and could be particularly strong in the second and third rounds. The Reign of Walsh</p>
        <p>During Bill Walsh's reign as the San Francisco coach from 1979 to 1988, the 49ers were masters of the draft. In 1986, Walsh came away with Larry Roberts, Tom Rathman, Tim McKyer, John Taylor, Charles Haley, Steve Wallace, Kevin Fagan and Don Griffin, all of whom helped solidify the 49ers' remarkable foundation.</p>
        <p>In 1979, Walsh selected Joe Montana in the third round; in 1983, Roger Craig in the second and Jesse Sapolu in the 11th, and in 1985, Jerry Rice with the final pick in the first round.</p>
        <p>For a third straight year, 49er executives Carmen Policy and John McVay and Coach George Seifert will attempt to live up to this tradition.</p>
        <p>But as the 49ers enter the draft today, they are no longer one of the teams to emulate. That honor has to go to the Chicago Bears, the Giants and Buffalo Bills, teams that subscribe to different drafting philosophies but show two common threads: finding players who fit the team's profile and placing character atop the checklist. Look, Listen, Learn</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay, New England and Atlanta -- the league's worst in recent drafts -- can learn plenty from those big three.</p>
        <p>The Giants, with General Manger George Young owning the final say, draft with a clear vision of the team's past, present and future.</p>
        <p>Bills Coach Marv Levy, who is also the team's vice president of football operations, owns a strong voice in his team's selections and looks for players who have "football mentality." In other words, Levy gathers players who love to practice and who love to work overtime.</p>
        <p>Levy also enjoys the wisdom of General Manager Bill Polian, who in 1987 showed the art of draft dealing when he packaged picks and players for linebacker Cornelius Bennett in a three-team trade involving the Colts and the Rams. True Believers</p>
        <p>The Bears believe in the draft.</p>
        <p>"We'd rather have our own players that we've selected come in and learn our system and do things our way than take guys from all over the place and try to teach them," said Bears Coach Mike Ditka.</p>
        <p>"We look for the guys that are going to come in and fit in and be a part of a tradition that's been around a long time: hard-nosed and hard-hitting kids that love playing the game in the rain, sleet or snow."</p>
        <p>The Bears' formula works. Sixteen of the team's 19 first-round picks since 1979 remain in the league and 10 are still Bears.</p>
