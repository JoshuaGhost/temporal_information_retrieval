        <p>The railroads are rolling again after last week's brief strike. Tough labor issues remain, but that did not deter George O. Zimmermann, a Gruntal &amp; Company analyst, from recommending the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, owner of the euphonious Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe line.</p>
        <p>His chief argument is that there is a lot more to Santa Fe than a railroad -- like abundant low-sulfur coal reserves, substantial gold reserves, real estate assets that are slated for early sale and a profitable refined-petroleum-products pipeline operation. He also expects the rail business to improve this year as the economy recovers, and he is impressed by the company's rapid reduction of the debt from a 1988 restructuring program.</p>

He also expects the rail business to improve this year as the economy recovers, and he is impressed by the company's rapid reduction of the debt from a 1988 restructuring program.</p>
        <p>The company's record is not unblemished, of course. Federal regulators forced it to drop a 1984 plan to merge its Santa Fe line with the Southern Pacific, and years of management disarray and poor performance followed. But Mr. Zimmermann now perceives improved leadership, leaner operations and brighter prospects.</p>
