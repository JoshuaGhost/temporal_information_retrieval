        <p>IN the first visit of a Soviet leader to Japan, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last week asked Japanese political and business leaders for aid for the distressed Soviet economy. Here are some of Mr. Gorbachev's statements, and some responses from Japanese businessmen whose funds he sought. He Said "If we don't halt the disintegration of the state -- of the economy, the law, and relations between republics -- the country could fall into the chaos that gives birth to dictatorship. Despair and hopelessness are a serious threat to the progress of civilization. Advanced countries help themselves by helping others." -- Mr. Gorbachev, speaking to the Japanese parliament. "These are stormy times, and it is not easy to hold the wheel of the ship steady. Let's not lose time. Don't hold back from taking part in these great projects. Our Far East and Siberia have resources, but they lack the infrastructure to develop them. I appeal to Japanese companies to consider helping develop the region." -- Mr. Gorbachev, speaking to business leaders. They Said "The economic conditions and infrastructure in your country are inadequate. . . . Our countries have to resolve their political problems and your country must lay the groundwork for the transition to an orderly market economy. Long-term investment will require economic and political stability." -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, president of Keidanren, the biggest Japanese business trade group. "I don't think Japanese business people will be attracted by the Soviet Union without having normal and good relations between our two countries. Once that happens, we can start talking about the projects in his speech." -- Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of the Orix Corporation, a leasing company.</p>
