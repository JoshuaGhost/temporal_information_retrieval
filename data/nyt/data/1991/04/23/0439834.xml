        <p>Television movies tackling big issues are indeed commendable for their worthy intentions, but too often the result gets mired in the artistic quicksand of being deadly earnest. Two ambitious docudramas bearing impressive credits are currently in circulation as examples: "One Man's War," starring Anthony Hopkins, on Home Box Office (tonight at 10 and other times throughout the month); and "Chernobyl: The Final Warning," starring Jon Voight, on TNT (this afternoon at 4, tomorrow at noon).</p>
        <p>By far the better of the two, "One Man's War" tells the true story of Joel Filartiga, a Paraguayan doctor and artist, played by Mr. Hopkins with his characteristic Welsh intensity. If Richard Burton hadn't existed, Mr. Hopkins would have invented him. Dr. Filartiga's 17-year-old son Joelito (Leonardo Garcia) is tortured and murdered in 1976 by police thugs during the brutal reign of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. Long a critic of the regime, the doctor becomes an open crusader seeking revenge. As something of a celebrity with supporters in the United States, Dr. Filartiga can claim a degree of protection. However, his wife (Norma Aleandro) and two daughters (Fernanda Torres and Mia Michelle) do not, and the doctor's sometimes reckless aggressiveness puts a strain on the family.</p>

        <p>Television movies tackling big issues are indeed commendable for their worthy intentions, but too often the result gets mired in the artistic quicksand of being deadly earnest. Two ambitious docudramas bearing impressive credits are currently in circulation as examples: "One Man's War," starring Anthony Hopkins, on Home Box Office (tonight at 10 and other times throughout the month); and "Chernobyl: The Final Warning," starring Jon Voight, on TNT (this afternoon at 4, tomorrow at noon).</p>
        <p>By far the better of the two, "One Man's War" tells the true story of Joel Filartiga, a Paraguayan doctor and artist, played by Mr. Hopkins with his characteristic Welsh intensity. If Richard Burton hadn't existed, Mr. Hopkins would have invented him. Dr. Filartiga's 17-year-old son Joelito (Leonardo Garcia) is tortured and murdered in 1976 by police thugs during the brutal reign of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. Long a critic of the regime, the doctor becomes an open crusader seeking revenge. As something of a celebrity with supporters in the United States, Dr. Filartiga can claim a degree of protection. However, his wife (Norma Aleandro) and two daughters (Fernanda Torres and Mia Michelle) do not, and the doctor's sometimes reckless aggressiveness puts a strain on the family.</p>
        <p>Directed by Sergio Toledo ("Vera"), "One Man's War" has the problem of dealing with a subject that by now is almost numbing. The cruelty and repression of certain Latin American dictatorships is depressingly familiar, and the frequent complicity of the United States is on the sorry record. Dr. Filartiga wryly comments on one paradox: "Curious people these Americans. They support Stroessner and give prizes to the people who fight him." But, along with the internal dissension in the Filartiga family, this aspect of the story is somewhat fudged. Punches are pulled, and "One Man's War" fails to go what should be the shattering distance.</p>
        <p>In addition, the broader significance of the Filartiga case is reduced to a few footnotes. The film ends with the older daughter leaving for New York in search of the chief murder suspect, who has fled Paraguay. There is much more to the story. Eventually, working with the Center for Constitutional Rights, the family filed a suit in the United States that resulted in a landmark decision enabling the victims of human rights abuses committed abroad to sue the perpetrators in American courts.</p>
        <p>The Filartigas were awarded $10.4 million in damages, but never collected; the torturer returned to Paraguay. The Stroessner dictatorship came to an end in 1989 but, this movie observes, "the nightmare in Paraguay continues." Something is obviously out of kilter when footnotes turn out to be more forceful and illuminating than the main text.</p>
        <p>"Chernobyl: The Final Warning" is one of those screen efforts that just had to be put together by a committee. An international production, with American, British and Soviet actors, its main claim to fame will probably be in what the producers describe as the "unprecedented cooperation" received from the Soviet Union, where most of the filming took place. The production team was given access to a nuclear power plant at Kursk, 400 miles south of Moscow, that was of the same design as the reactor at Chernobyl. It was the latter, of course, that exploded on April 26, 1986, in the worst nuclear industrial accident ever.</p>
        <p>Portraying Dr. Robert Gale, a California specialist in bone-marrow transplants, Mr. Voight spends a great deal of time doing strenuous jogging, even after he gets to Moscow to assist Soviet medical teams tending to the seriously injured. At no point, let it be said, does Mr. Voight look less than seriously concerned. Ernest Kinoy's script juggles a kind of primer on devastating nuclear statistics with a personal-angle story about a young pregnant woman, Elena (Sammi Davis), whose husband is among the more seriously injured at the plant.</p>
        <p>Care has clearly been taken to not upset Soviet sensibilities. Medical facilities may be inadequate but Dr. Gale, while ordering the newest machines from abroad, explains that while the technology of the Soviet doctors is "spotty," their insight and skill are "very impressive." On the other hand, impressed by Dr. Gale, Yelena assures her suffering husband: "If he came all this way, he must be very special. The Americans are very advanced." Balance is all, apparently.</p>
        <p>And so the film unfolds, meandering from one predictable scene to another and somehow managing to transform a disaster of epic proportions into a terrribly ordinary and inadequate movie. In what must be one of the oddest assignments in a generally distinguished career, Jason Robards pops in for a few mercifully brief scenes as the industrialist Armand Hammer.</p>
