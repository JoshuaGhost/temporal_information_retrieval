        <p>America's giant insurance companies are abandoning their cherished tradition of paternalism, cutting jobs on a scale almost unthinkable a few years ago.</p>
        <p>The cutbacks come after insurers have failed to improve results through more tentative means like dropping poorly performing insurance lines and brokers who yield the companies no profits.</p>
        <p>Several major companies have begun cutting back. The USF&amp;G Corporation of Baltimore, with major losses in its real estate and "junk bond" portfolios, said earlier this month that it would reduce its work force by 2,800 people, or 25 percent, in 1991. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company said it would offer early retirement to 4,000 of its 9,000 New York employees, and that 1,000 were expected to accept.  Other Recent Layoffs</p>
        <p>Others announced staff reductions in the previous months: The Aetna Life and Casualty Company is cutting 2,600 employees, or roughly 5.5 percent of its domestic work force; the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 757 employees, or 11.7 percent of its total, and the Travelers Corporation, 1,000 employees, or 3 percent percent of its total. The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company has reportedly had heavy layoffs too, but declines to comment.</p>
        <p>Except for USF&amp;G, the percentages of workers involved are not huge; together, the cutbacks amount to less than 1 percent of the 2.1 million people who, according to the Labor Department, worked in insurance as of Dec. 31. Many of the cuts came as companies left unprofitable insurance lines, like Aetna's decision to stop writing individual health policies. To the extent that these policies will be issued by others, the jobs eliminated by Aetna will be made up elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the latest layoffs are the most severe that many in the industry remember. While they have cut their staffs before, the biggest insurers have long been known as benevolent parents, where most held onto their jobs in good times or bad. Insurers could get away with consistent staffing regardless of business volume because many were mutuals, owned by policyholders, not by investors. One insurer, Metropolitan Life, still gives employees a free hot lunch every day.</p>
        <p>Lately, returns in many insurance lines have worsened so much that even the most protective of insurers have begun to wield the ax.</p>
        <p>"For years, insurers viewed themselves as having a wider, statesmanlike position in America," said Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a New York trade group. "They would wage expensive campaigns against drunk driving and auto theft even if they hurt profits. Now that is changing. More and more, people running insurance companies are saying, 'This is a business, and it has got to be run for the bottom line.' "</p>
        <p>Behind the work-force reductions lies the toughest business environment insurers have faced in years.</p>
        <p>For life insurers, fierce competition from investment firms has made it much harder to win money-management business from pension funds. Lower prices for real estate and junk bonds have cut deeply into life insurers' investment returns.</p>
        <p>Property-and-casualty insurers, meanwhile, have been grappling with a fourth year of depressed premium levels for commercial liability policies. They face a continually expanding legal definition of liability. Many business liability insurers say they never dreamed of having to pay for pollution cleanup, an area of coverage that courts are often forcing them to provide.</p>
        <p>Auto insurance lines have their own problems, among them rate rollbacks by the states and soaring jury awards and medical costs.</p>
        <p>All this has taken a toll. According to the A.M. Best Company, a research firm based in Oldwick, N.J., property-and-casualty insurers reported an average return on shareholders' investment of 6.7 percent in 1990 -- up from 6.1 percent in 1989 but still well below what investment professionals say the insurers should be earning given their risks.</p>
        <p>Life insurers' returns were much better -- about 13 percent in 1989, by A.M. Best's most recent figure -- but still below the 17 percent to 20 percent that top-performing companies in other sectors generate. Industry experts say that life insurance returns fell sharply last year under the weight of junk bond defaults and continued weakness in real estate.</p>
        <p>All sides agree that the job reductions are needed to lift insurer returns, but not about whether the companies are cutting fat or muscle. Most consumer groups and some analysts have long said that many of the country's biggest insurers could stand a diet.</p>
        <p>"Most of these companies have not been very efficient," said Gloria Vogel, who follows the industry for Bear, Stearns &amp; Company. "Among property-and-casualty companies, 30 percent of every premium dollar goes to expense."</p>
        <p>George G. C. Parker, who teaches about financial institutions at the Stanford Business School, says that many insurers became complacent. With the large amount of capital and the knowledge of regulations required to enter the industry, Professor Parker said, "insurers could afford to be a little sloppy in productivity and still earn a decent return."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mooney of the Insurance Information Institute said that insurers' expense-to-revenue ratio was no worse than that of other industries. Banks spend about 30 percent of their interest income on overhead, department stores 35 percent and specialty stores 38.6 percent. More Layoffs Loom</p>
        <p>Alan Levin, the senior insurance specialist at the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation, said that despite some seemingly high costs -- like agent's commissions equal to 15 percent of a policy's first-year premium -- the insurers are actually efficient. "There just are not that many excess people," he said.</p>
        <p>Most industry experts say that more layoff announcements loom, if only because the reductions announced so far will not allow the insurers to produce a more respectable 15 percent return on shareholders' money. Any savings will benefit insurance shareholders in the form of higher profits. Higher profits, in turn, will benefit policyholders in terms of the companies' ability to pay claims.</p>
        <p>But not all analysts believe that cutting jobs is the most sensible approach to improving returns. Most insurers continue to lose money on the insurance side of their business, profiting only by earnings on investments.</p>
        <p>"I find it amusing that in hard times the insurers focus on reducing overhead," said Michael Smith, the insurance analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "They accept the fact that the expense that represents 75 percent of their outlays -- namely, claims payments -- cannot be controlled."</p>
