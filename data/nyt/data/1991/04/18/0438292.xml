        <p>Mother Hale, the frail-looking Harlem woman who has been compared to Mother Teresa and called an "American Hero," is not going to have to give up taking care of babies born addicted to crack after all.</p>
        <p>In a dispute with City Hall and child-care officials last fall over what was best for the children, the city decided to stop sending infants to the group nursery home that she has been running for more than 20 years.  Care 'Better Than Before'</p>
        <p>But yesterday morning Mother Hale said that with tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from people around the country as well as from a group of 250 city churches she was going to be able to continue her work as surrogate mother to the unwanted and helpless victims of crack.</p>
        <p>"God has given me the responsibility to care for these children," she said, "and now we are going to be able to provide for them even better than before." Mother Hale, 85 years old, did not send out a news release to announce the good fortune.</p>
        <p>But with customary grace and good timing, she made it the centerpiece of a visit by Bob Martinez, the new director of National Drug Control Policy, who was looking at New York treatment centers.</p>
        <p>Wedged on a couch between Mother Hale and her daugher, Dr. Lorraine E. Hale, Mr. Martinez, a former Florida Governor who was known for his tough law-and-order tactics, reached over, patted the older woman's hand and said, "The whole country's proud of you."Upstairs in the nursery, Mr. Martinez scooped up Michael and Susie, 2-year-old twins, and bounced them on his knees.</p>
        <p>He began the day talking with recovering addicts at a former convent in the High Bridge section of the Bronx, which is part of the Samaritan Village complex of treatment centers.</p>
        <p>Last fall, the city praised Hale House but said it had decided to close all group nurseries, convinced that the children would be better off living in families with foster parents.</p>
