        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Hidden Wealth" (letter, March 23), Kenneth A. Gruber of Condado, P.R., makes misinformed statements on the Puerto Rico tax system, which I must refute.</p>
        <p>While it may be true that there is substantial underreporting of income among certain professionals in Puerto Rico -- as also in the United States -- it is not true that my department does not investigate these cases. We use the same methods of income tax examination as the Internal Revenue Service, including the indirect method of imputing income alluded to by Mr. Gruber.</p>
        <p>We are also involved in special projects to use available sources of information for our audits. For instance, we are using computerized systems to match income tax returns with payments reported to us from different sources, such as those made by medical plans, by brokers reporting to the I.R.S. who have Puerto Rican clients with investments in the United States and income reported to the Social Security Administration.</p>
        <p>With respect to the high level of consumer sales at chain stores on Puerto Rico, it is my belief that these are not necessarily related to alleged underreporting of income. Please keep in mind that Puerto Ricans are entitled to the benefits of the Nutritional Assistance Program -- similar to the food stamp program -- except that our beneficiaries receive cash instead of food stamps. Studies have shown there is a high rate of debt-financed consumption in Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>As to deferral of income under the Puerto Rico Income Tax Law, it is not true that 100 percent of the income can be deferred in Puerto Rico, as compared with only a limited amount in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Puerto Rico Income Tax Reform of 1987 introduced provisions very similar to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code to the Puerto Rico Income Tax Act, which permit the deferral of income through qualified plans up to certain limitations and subject to certain requirements provided by law. Besides Section 401(k) plans, Puerto Rico also allows deferred compensation arrangements. However, these are subject to the same rules of constructive receipt as the I.R.S. applies.</p>
        <p>We are making sure that taxpayers fully assume their responsibility by using all legal means available to us to enforce the income tax laws and collect the taxes owed. These means include, as a last resort, the lien and attachment of the property of the taxpayer. As you can see, Puerto Rico is no tax haven for the income tax evader, as Mr. Gruber seems to imply.  RAMON GARCIA SANTIAGO Secretary, Treasury Department, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico San Juan, P.R., March 28, 1991</p>
