        <p>In a trio of saxophone, bass and drums, the saxophonist faces a marathon, as he plays nearly every solo. He also has the chance to rove far afield, since there is no chordal instrument to establish the harmonies. Branford Marsalis is using that lineup at the Village Vanguard through tomorrow; in Wednesday's first set, he made the challenge sound both easy and exhilarating.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsalis is growing away from his models, Wayne Shorter and John Coltrane, to find tone, pacing and strategies of his own. His playing never shouts or wails; its passions are more understated, as his solos croon melodies or streak through harmonic permutations with a jovial sense of assurance and discovery. While he occasionally relies too heavily on melodic sequences, working one phrase up and down the scale, more often he just pours out ideas.</p>

        <p>In a trio of saxophone, bass and drums, the saxophonist faces a marathon, as he plays nearly every solo. He also has the chance to rove far afield, since there is no chordal instrument to establish the harmonies. Branford Marsalis is using that lineup at the Village Vanguard through tomorrow; in Wednesday's first set, he made the challenge sound both easy and exhilarating.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsalis is growing away from his models, Wayne Shorter and John Coltrane, to find tone, pacing and strategies of his own. His playing never shouts or wails; its passions are more understated, as his solos croon melodies or streak through harmonic permutations with a jovial sense of assurance and discovery. While he occasionally relies too heavily on melodic sequences, working one phrase up and down the scale, more often he just pours out ideas.</p>
        <p>In the trio, Robert Hurst on bass usually provided a stable center with walking basslines. Jeff Watts on drums stirred up the rhythm, creating crosscurrents of cymbals, answering saxophone flurries with sputters of snare drum or knocking out offbeats on unexpected instruments, like a cowbell.</p>
        <p>The set started out sprinting, with an Ornette Coleman piece, "Toy Dance," in which the tenor saxophone solo moved from breakneck perpetual motion to easy, balladlike phrases to riffling, Coltrane-like arpeggios, all with a suave tone that offset the music's athleticism. Mr. Marsalis has taken to heart the flexible pulse of Mr. Coleman's music; throughout the set, his solos sailed past the demarcations of bar lines and choruses, following logic and musical whim where they led.</p>
        <p>In a ballad, "Cocktails for Two," Mr. Marsalis honored the tune with a breathy leisure and calmly spun out melodic lines, now and then letting loose a swirl of arpeggios. He picked up the soprano saxophone for two uptempo pieces, including an angular, zigzagging theme by Mr. Hurst, the trio's bassist. Mr. Marsalis skipped lightly into melodies, then zoomed through coils of filigree. Returning to tenor saxophone, he closed with a version of "Dancing Cheek to Cheek" so fast that it would have winded Fred Astaire. For all his virtuosity, Mr. Marsalis doesn't act like a showoff; he'd rather make a tour de force sound like an evening's relaxed ramble.</p>
