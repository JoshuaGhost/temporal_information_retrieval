        <p>Three Vietnamese gunmen from a youth gang and three hostages died in a chaotic hail of gunfire late Thursday as county sheriff's deputies stormed an electronics store that the gang had held for eight hours.</p>
        <p>The bloody climax of the long siege came as a police sniper in the parking lot, thinking he had a clear shot, fired through the open front entrance of the store only to have the door slam and deflect the bullet.</p>
        <p>The door was open because a hostage was claiming a bulletproof vest left there for the gunmen. The gunmen had demanded the protective garment in a confusing negotiation that involved a changing group of police negotiators, several interpreters and a shifting list of demands.  Killings at Close Range</p>
        <p>As the door was slamming on the police sniper's bullet, one of the four gunmen inside the Good Guys Store was systematically shooting hostages at close range. That gunman and two others were killed by sheriff's deputies, who came charging out of a rear storeroom where they had been hiding. The deputies had dropped into the building through the roof of an adjoining store several hours earlier.</p>
        <p>A fourth gunman survived the gun battle and is unconscious in a Sacramento hospital. He has been charged with murder, Sheriff Glen Craig said at a news conference here today, but the Sheriff said the man had not yet been identified.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Craig said the gunmen were members of a local gang called the Oriental Boys, one of several Asian gangs that have complicated crime and law enforcement in this region in recent years. They were armed with a shotgun and three 9-millimeter pistols, he said, that were bought legally at a local sporting goods store last week after the background check and 15-day waiting period required by California law.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Craig said that after a call from an employee of the store to the 911 emergency number at 1:33 P.M. yesterday, the incident was thought to be a foiled robbery. But subsequent interviews with many of the surviving 38 hostages, 10 of whom are hospitalized with gunshot wounds and one because of a miscarriage, persuaded him that no robbery was intended.</p>
        <p>"They were attempting to gain notoriety," Sheriff Craig said. He said the gunmen had told negotiators and hostages that they were dissatisfied with their lives in the United States, frustrated by the difficulty of finding jobs and eager to be "movie stars" during the televised hostage crisis. Negotiations by Phone</p>
        <p>For the first several hours of the siege, negotiations were conducted on the telephone by a sergeant at headquarters downtown. Later, a special negotiating team took over at the scene, a shopping mall a few miles south of the capital.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Craig said the gunmen's demands included $4 million, four bullet-proof vests, a helicopter and some 1,000-year-old ginger plant, which was to be made into tea.  "We couldn't get them to focus on one demand," he said. But the sheriff added that the gunmen were most consistently interested in the vests.</p>
        <p>Early on, a sergeant outside the electronics store delivered one vest in exchange for the release of a female hostage and two small children. Later, three small children and two women were released and a man was sent out to deliver a message to the deputies. He did not return to the store.</p>
        <p>At nightfall the parking lot at the mall was kept dark so the police could see into the store, which was kept lighted. The mother and cousin of one armed man were outside the store and a Buddhist priest was available by telephone, but the armed men refused to talk to any of them. Still, with no injuries, law-enforcement officials were optimistic that the siege would end peacefully.</p>
        <p>But the situation suddenly became violent about 9 P.M., when an armed man shot a male hostage in the leg and sent him hobbling outside to convey demands to a local television station. Sheriff Craig said there was hope that the gunmen would be occupied with watching their message on the dozens of television sets in the store and thus would be vulnerable to attack by the snipers. But he said it was determined that such an attack would be too dangerous for the hostages.</p>
        <p>At the same time, negotiations involving vests in exchange for hostages continued. A second vest was dropped outside the door, but rather than sending out nine hostages, as promised, the gunmen shot another one of the men being held. Time for Action</p>
        <p>Sheriff Craig said he decided it was time for action.</p>
        <p>The sniper in the parking lot tried to shoot at the gunmen when the door opened.  The shot shattered the front door of the store. Amid exploding glass screens and gunfire -- all of it seen on television as it happened here last night -- one of the gunmen ran down a line of hostages, shooting them one by one at point blank range.</p>
        <p>He and two other gunmen were then killed by shotgun fire from the weapons of officers who moved in from the rear of the store. The gunman who survived was wearing the vest that had been left earlier, Sheriff Craig said.</p>
        <p>The three dead hostages were identified as Kris Sohne and John Fritz, both employees of the store, and Fernando Gutierrez, a customer.</p>
        <p>In the confusion last night the sheriff's department gave out many incorrect details, including information about the nationalities of the armed men . The men were initially described as Thai, but today Sheriff Craig said they were Vietnamese of Chinese extraction. He declined to give their names, ages or any other biographical information, saying their identities remained in doubt.</p>
        <p>Several hostages today were critical of how the negotiations were conducted and of the timing of the snipers' move on the store. "There should have been some way to storm the place at a sooner point," said Charlie Rengel, a salesman who was on his second day of work when the siege began. Mr. Rengel was shot in the knee and ankle and was recuperating today at Methodist Hospital here.</p>
        <p>After the incident, Sheriff Craig was besieged by questions about the wisdom of switching negotiators midstream and about the timing of the sniper assault. He said that he had "agonized over all this close to 1,000 times" during the night and that he had accepted that his decisions might be second-guessed. But "quite frankly I'm not sure what we could have done differently," he said.</p>
        <p>At the Florin Mall today, the Good Guys Store was closed while deputies gathered evidence. The cars of several hospitalized hostages remained in the parking lot, cordoned off with yellow tape. A bouquet of carnations rested on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Among the curious onlookers, there were some who spoke fearfully of the gangs forming among Sacramento's swelling Asian-American population.  Refugees Are Easy Prey</p>
        <p>The police and social workers who deal with Asian gangs say communities of refugees have become easy prey to Vietnamese gangs here who specialize in "home invasions," in which family members are tortured until they reveal the hiding places of hoarded gold and jewelry.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the authorities say, small businesses like the electronics store have become the focus of gang crime.</p>
        <p>In one period of heavy crime early last year, the Sacramento police counted 14 home robberies in the county and 10 in the city, with nearly 80 victims terrorized by the intruders.</p>
        <p>"I think the worst hasn't come yet," said one woman at the mall. "I think we're going to have repercussions."</p>
