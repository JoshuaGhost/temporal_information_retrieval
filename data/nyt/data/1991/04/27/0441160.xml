        <p>In a grant that will double the light-collecting power of the world's largest telescope, the W. M. Keck Foundation announced yesterday that it would pay $74.6 million to build a twin of the giant Keck telescope, which is nearing completion in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>The new astronomical telescope, to be called Keck II, will operate in tandem with Keck I atop the extinct Mauna Kea volcano on the island of Hawaii. Both telescopes, which will be electronically linked, will have light-gathering mirrors equivalent to 10 meters, or nearly 33 feet, in diameter. Even when operating independently of each other, each would share primacy as the most powerful telescope in the world. Keck I is to begin scientific observations early next year, and Keck II is to be completed in 1996, a spokesman said.</p>

        <p>In a grant that will double the light-collecting power of the world's largest telescope, the W. M. Keck Foundation announced yesterday that it would pay $74.6 million to build a twin of the giant Keck telescope, which is nearing completion in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>The new astronomical telescope, to be called Keck II, will operate in tandem with Keck I atop the extinct Mauna Kea volcano on the island of Hawaii. Both telescopes, which will be electronically linked, will have light-gathering mirrors equivalent to 10 meters, or nearly 33 feet, in diameter. Even when operating independently of each other, each would share primacy as the most powerful telescope in the world. Keck I is to begin scientific observations early next year, and Keck II is to be completed in 1996, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The construction of an identical telescope about 280 feet away on the same 13,600-foot-high mountain peak will not just double the combined light-gathering power of the first Keck telescope. It will also enable the two instruments to combine their light in such a way as to greatly reduce atmospheric distortion, improving their ability to distinguish between distant objects very close together. This will be possible through a technique known as interferometric observations.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the California Institute of Technology, builder of both Keck telescopes, said the resolving power of the two instruments working in tandem would allow them to distinguish between the two headlights of a car from a distance of 16,000 miles. Vast Capacities for Observation</p>
        <p>This will permit by far the most detailed observations ever made of the galaxies and quasars near the edge of the observable universe. That means astronomers will be able to observe the universe as it appeared in its infancy. That is because the light from those objects began its earthward journey soon after the big bang that most astronomers believe marked the birth of the universe 15 billion years ago.</p>
        <p>The matchless resolving power of the twin Kecks will also make possible a realistic search for "brown dwarfs" -- large planets that presumably failed to reach the status of stars -- in orbit around distant stars.</p>
        <p>The Keck I telescope, which was successfully tested with part of its segmented mirror in place last November, is based on an innovative design that some critics had considered risky. Unlike the light-collecting mirrors in conventional astronomical telescopes, which are concave blocks of glass coated with films of reflective aluminum, the Keck's mirror is a honeycomb pattern of 36 hexagonal segments.</p>
        <p>Each segment, made of relatively thin glass, is mounted separately and backed by motor-driven support points. As gravitational and other forces tend to deform the glass and spoil reflected images, a computer adjusts the pressure of the support points to prevent any mirror deformation during observations. Superlative Astronomical Tool</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward C. Stone Jr., chairman of the California Association for Research in Astronomy, which supervises the Keck project, said in an interview that the great light-gathering and resolving powers of the combined Keck telescopes would give American astronomy a superlative tool for the indefinite future.</p>
        <p>A rival project, the Very Large Telescope, supported by a consortium of European nations at an observatory being built in northern Chile, will have somewhat more light-gathering power but will not begin scientific observations until near the end of the century.</p>
        <p>Some astronomers and others have found it difficult to concentrate on complex tasks while working at the high-altitude Keck Observatory dome. Astronomers and their assistants will therefore control the telescopes and make their observations from a headquarters building in the village of Waimea, which is at a comfortable altitude below the mountain.</p>
        <p>"Eventually," Dr. Stone said, "we'd like to see the telescopes linked electronically to a control and observation center in California, so astronomers could work right here."</p>
        <p>The first Keck telescope will cost about $87 million, and the second is expected to cost $93.3 million, of which the Keck Foundation has agreed to pay 80 percent, or $74.6 million. The University of California, which shares sponsorship of the project with the California Institute of Technology, will pay the rest.</p>
        <p>The Keck telescopes will be the most expensive privately financed scientific instruments in the United States. The Keck Foundation was created in 1954 by W. M. Keck, founder of the Superior Oil Company, which at one time was the world's largest independent producer of oil and gas.</p>
