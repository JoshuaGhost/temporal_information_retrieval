        <p>Washington's hopes of enlisting Guatemala in its fight against cocaine trafficking rest on the resolution of a murder case involving an American innkeeper reportedly slain by Guatemalan troops, Bush Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>The killing of the American, Michael DeVine, who was found June 9 along a jungle road with his hands tied and his head partly severed, has become the defining point in relations between Washington and Guatemala City.</p>
        <p>The Administration cut off its $3.3 million annual military aid program in December to protest the army's refusal to interrogate two ranking officers implicated in the case.</p>
        <p>Senior State Department officials said the new President, Jorge Serrano Elias, had made important strides in bringing the case to trial in the last few weeks. They cautiously expressed the hope that prosecutions of officers in the killing would open the way for the United States to enlist the Guatemalan Army in a coordinated effort to interdict cocaine flown from Colombia.</p>
        <p>Melvyn Levitsky, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, said Mexico had become so successful in interdicting cocaine flights over the last six months that many traffickers now land in Guatemala. From there, they either refuel or unload to ship their drugs by land through Mexico into the United States.</p>
        <p>A senior State Department official said American military Awacs surveillance aircraft that fly over the Caribbean and the Pacific could share information on drug flights with the Guatemalan Army, which could then carry troops in helicopters to the landing sites. In turn, he said United States officials could benefit from information collected by the army's spy network to identify clandestine landing strips and opium poppy fields.</p>
        <p>The United States has reported in recent years that Guatemala had became a major producer of opium poppies. An aerial eradication campaign in which the law enforcement officials of the two nations cooperated destroyed most of the crop in 1990, the State Department says.</p>
        <p>"Until we have a military relationship again, we are hindered in our ability to help them in their drug effort," Mr. Levitsky said. "The DeVine case is one of the major impediments to full cooperation."</p>
        <p>Officials in the State and Defense Departments are divided over whether the United States should cooperate with the Guatemalan Army, given the persistent allegations that it has directed death-squad activities.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeVine, who was 49 years old and from Belleville, Ill., and his wife, Carol, had lived in Guatemala for almost 20 years.</p>
        <p>After her husband was killed, Mrs. DeVine hired an American private investigator who found witnesses who said they had seen five soldiers and one peasant driving in the white pickup truck reportedly used as the getaway vehicle. The investigator said he had found that the truck belonged to the army base at the nearby town of Flores. The vehicle was found back at the barracks, repainted red, he said.</p>
        <p>No motive has been established in the killing, although a United States Senate aide monitoring the case has speculated that Mr. DeVine might have come across a poppy field protected by the army on one of his hiking trips.</p>
        <p>The case appeared to be stalled until last month, when the five soldiers -- who were identified and have been held since October -- volunteered to give depositions in which they declared their innocence but implicated two officers and seven other soldiers.</p>
        <p>United States officials said the depositions say the soldiers either overheard the nine new suspects preparing for the crime, or saw them leaving the base to commit the killing.</p>
        <p>A military judge has ordered that the two officers named in the depositions be compelled to testify.</p>
        <p>A State Department official credited President Serrano with following up on the depositions by transfering judicial proceedings from remote Peten Province to the capital, "presumably to permit enhanced scrutiny."</p>
        <p>A Guatemalan official who is monitoring the case said, "We are committed to getting to the bottom of this."</p>
