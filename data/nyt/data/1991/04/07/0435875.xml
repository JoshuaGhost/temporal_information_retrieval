        <p>One of the great bogus concepts wafting through management suites is something called "consensus:" solving knotty problems through unanimity.</p>
        <p>As a concept it's a failure -- and in the end, that's what it produces, too: failure and mediocrity in performance, accountability, options, even commitment to the project. Something that is everyone's task is nobody's task.</p>

        <p>One of the great bogus concepts wafting through management suites is something called "consensus:" solving knotty problems through unanimity.</p>
        <p>As a concept it's a failure -- and in the end, that's what it produces, too: failure and mediocrity in performance, accountability, options, even commitment to the project. Something that is everyone's task is nobody's task.</p>
        <p>But another management strategy is fast becoming the mark of corporations that excel -- Motorola, Corning, Intel, 3M, among others -- and it involves teamwork without consensus. This strategy spins on the ability of a company to manage diversity.</p>
        <p>This is how it works. Consider a team to be a well-identified unit of five to nine peers who share time and space and report to a boss or team leader. Imagine assembling a team of people who are well educated, talented and well trained. They care about their business and each other. They've done their homework and in meetings, they act as advocates of particular ideas.</p>
        <p>It would be downright silly to think these people might arrive at a single point of view. More to the point, we shouldn't want them to. Who needs resolutions so watered down that no one cares what gets decided? What companies should strive for is a climate that encourages competing options. That's what produces results.</p>
        <p>How can companies achieve this? To manage diversity, someone must sit at the head of the table to make the final decision, to choose from competing options that have been brought up by team members. Those "facilitators," the hottest executives in America today, are:</p>
        <p>* Astute selectors, carefully determining who will be on their team. They may be new to the job, and even inherit a team, but they must be able to assess who's with them and who's not, who should be hired and fired, and who can be given more time to grow because potential is there.</p>
        <p>* Invisible initiators, encouraging team members to act on their diverse strengths. They believe in their people more than those associates believe in themselves. They make sure employees stretch themselves and take risks. And they make sure the employees -- not the facilitators -- get credit for accomplishments.</p>
        <p>* Willing workers, who don't sit behind a desk, barking orders. Nor do they overdelegate. Rather, they give their strengths to the organization, doing their share of the work that is generated through collaborations with team members.</p>
        <p>* Learners, prepared to have their minds changed by subordinates who may know more about the subject. This, of all their roles, is most important for facilitators.</p>
        <p>When all of these pieces are in place, they produce not only strong management but future strength: Subordinates learn from facilitators so that they, too, can manage diversity. When this new teamwork is in place, it can produce a company that is energized, fiercely competitive -- and a lot more fun to work at.  FORUM</p>
