        <p>When Christine Todd Whitman came within a hair of defeating Senator Bill Bradley last fall, many said the man she had really run against was Gov. Jim Florio. Now Mrs. Whitman appears to be trying again, this time without a stand-in.</p>
        <p>Since the Senate election, she has continued to campaign across New Jersey without letup. She has formed a political action committee, ostensibly to develop issues and to help Republican candidates for the Legislature in November.</p>
        <p>But the ultimate goal may be hidden in the committee's telephone number in Somerset: 704-1993. Mr. Florio is up for re-election in 1993. The name of the committee is the Committee for an Affordable New Jersey. Jim Florio is the Governor who engineered the biggest tax increase in the state's history.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman laughs off the telephone number as a kind of political joke to needle other potential Republican candidates for governor. "That number was fun," she said. "Everybody was insisting that I was running for governor when I was running for the Senate."</p>
        <p>"Cary Edwards said the day after the election that I was going to have to get past him if I was going to run for governor, and I said, all right, I'll make you think a little bit more."</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards, a former Attorney General, lost the Republican primary for governor in 1989 and has made no secret of his intention to run again.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman, a former Somerset County Freeholder and former president of the State Board of Public Utilities, turns away questions about her plans with a smile and a standard response: "Ask me next year."</p>
        <p>Pressed, she adds, "Clearly I am interested in what happens in the state, and I want to be a player."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's approach to being "a player" is at the moment to crisscross the state, speaking to any group that invites her, meeting with candidates, writing a newspaper column, and hosting a regular biweekly talk show on Trenton's WKXW-FM, the radio station that brought the statewide tax protest against Governor Florio and the Democratic Legislature into being.</p>
        <p>She talks about the issues, from taxes to teachers, but everywhere there is a consistent and underlying message: "People are angry and concerned. Nobody listens, you are being ignored. People are saying politics is so dirty and corrupt that the people who are in it don't really care, and it isn't going to get any better. There is no accountability. There is no credibility."</p>
        <p>They are phrases that come up repeatedly in her personal appearances and in her stints as a talk show host. She also often says "I don't know all the answers" -- but she listens to the questions and she responds sympathetically.</p>
        <p>And while she rails against negative campaigning, she is not above slipping in a gibe here and there, as when she told a caller on her radio talk show last week, "If the present Governor was a weatherman and predicted sunny, dry weather, people would start reaching for their umbrellas." Plays in Princeton</p>
        <p>Nor is she reluctant to tell women, as she did at a panel discussion before a gathering of the Women's Resource Center in Summit last week, "Women should support women" -- if, she amended, they are qualified.</p>
        <p>The whole package seems to play well with her audiences.</p>
        <p>At Princeton University, where she spoke to a seminar at the Woodrow Wilson School attended by an audience of about 60 students and townspeople, one young man proclaimed in a question-and-answer period that he had worked for Mr. Bradley in the recent Senate campaign but would work for Mrs. Whitman if she ran for governor.</p>
        <p>The young man, 20-year-old Jeff Trost, a junior in the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, said later: "Yeah, I would support her for governor. I would work for her against anybody except Bradley."</p>
        <p>An administrator at the Woodrow Wilson School who acted as host, Richard Roper, said afterward that Mrs. Whitman's performance against the Senator, in a race in which he spent $12 million to about $1.6 million for her but barely won by a ratio of 51 percent to 49 percent, established for Mrs. Whitman "a national reputation as a rising Republican star."</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Whitman concedes that the near victory was not all her doing. Benefit From Backlash</p>
        <p>In fact, she "ran ahead of her name recognition," as the phrase goes among political analysts.</p>
        <p>That means that in her race against Mr. Bradley when voters were asked to name the Republican candidate, many of them could not do so. In fact, though only 34 percent of voters could name the Republican candidate, Mrs. Whitman, 49 percent voted for her. Or rather, they voted against a name they did know -- Bill Bradley.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman does not deny that much of her success resulted from a backlash against Mr. Bradley because he refused to condemn -- or even discuss -- Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, highest in state history.</p>
        <p>"It was not so much people voting for me to send a message to Florio, although people were certainly doing that," she said at the Princeton appearance, "but they were so upset about what was happening in this state that they began questioning people they had never questioned before. If I had asked the same questions of Bill Bradley two years ago that I asked last year, people would have not wanted to listen. But after the tax increase, they were willing to listen and question -- 'What is Bill Bradley doing?' "</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's stands on the issues are measured and moderate. She says, for example, that she was not nor is she now steadfastly against tax increases. "I never took the no-new-taxes pledge when I was running for the Senate," she told a caller on her radio talk show. "I don't think you should promise that you won't need new revenues for six years. But I don't think you should turn immediately to the taxpayers every time you have a money problem." Money for Classrooms</p>
        <p>Her stands on the issues are standard moderate Republican. She supports a cut in the capital gains tax, for example, but says it should be tailored to "help people" -- such as eliminating the capital gains tax altogether for money made on investments in the nation's inner cities.</p>
        <p>She also supports increased spending -- and taxes to pay for it -- in the schools, if there is "accountability -- a guarantee that the money is actually going into the classroom."</p>
        <p>She had gained a high profile and important support. Among her advisers is Roger Stone, a partner in the Washington political consulting firm of Manafort, Black, Stone &amp; Kelly that was sold a few months ago to a large lobbying and public relations concern, Burson-Marsteller. 'Strong Potential Candidate'</p>
        <p>"I gave a thousand dollars to her PAC," Mr. Stone said. "We have been talking."</p>
        <p>Robert Franks, chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, said, "I think she is an exceptionally strong potential candidate. The 1990 election demonstrated she is strong."</p>
        <p>"Clearly she's still basking in the glow of 1990 -- she might be considered a frontrunner for statewide office, clearly an outstanding statewide candidaate."</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Franks said, "There are a lot of potential candidates, and the whole thing is wide open."</p>
        <p>One thing Mrs. Whitman could probably count on if she runs for governor is the support of members of Hands Across New Jersey, the citizens group that spearheaded the tax protest against Mr. Florio and gathered about 800,000 signatures in an anti-tax petition drive.</p>
        <p>"I hope she'll run," said Pat Ralston, the co-founder of the group, who emphasized that it is nonpartisan. "Very definitely there is stong feeling for her among the Hands people, but it is a personal feeling, not a partisan thing."</p>
        <p>In looking toward the next campaign, Mrs. Whitman is unabashedly partisan -- "My father was Republican state chairman for 10 years; my mother was a Republican committeewoman and head of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women, immediately preceded by her mother" -- but she is gently critical of her own party.</p>
        <p>"My great concern," she says, "is that we Republicans will just say, 'Look at what Florio has done; elect me instead.' People are smarter than that; they will say, how would you have done it?"</p>
