        <p>Fire officials say a pile of oil-soaked rags left by an office renovation crew began the Feb. 23 fire that killed three firefighters in a high-rise office building.</p>
        <p>The city's fire commissioner, Roger M. Ulshafer, said the crew had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office on the 22d floor of the high rise, One Meridian Plaza. When they finished for the day, he said, the workers left 25 pounds of rags soaked with linseed oil in a heap on the floor. He said the linseed oil generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then ignited containers of other solvents left nearby.</p>

        <p>Fire officials say a pile of oil-soaked rags left by an office renovation crew began the Feb. 23 fire that killed three firefighters in a high-rise office building.</p>
        <p>The city's fire commissioner, Roger M. Ulshafer, said the crew had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office on the 22d floor of the high rise, One Meridian Plaza. When they finished for the day, he said, the workers left 25 pounds of rags soaked with linseed oil in a heap on the floor. He said the linseed oil generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then ignited containers of other solvents left nearby.</p>
        <p>The city fire code requires combustible materials to be stored in fire-proof, covered recepticles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ulshafer refused to identify the renovation company, but The Philadelphia Inquirer said law-enforcement officials had identified it as the F. X. Griffin Company of Manayunk, Pa. The Inquirer reported that the company president, Joseph Griffin, told a reporter several days after the fire that his crew had been working on the 22d floor and had signed out of the building about four hours before the blaze began. Mr. Griffin was unavailable for comment today.</p>
        <p>Fire officials said the blaze swept to the 30th floor of the 38-story building before being subdued. One Meridian Plaza, built in 1972, has no sprinklers on floors below the 30th. Fire officials have cited the failure of the building's other emergency systems, including water and electrical systems, as hindering their efforts to fight the blaze.</p>
        <p>The building is owned by E/R Associates and managed by Richard I. Rubin and Company.</p>
