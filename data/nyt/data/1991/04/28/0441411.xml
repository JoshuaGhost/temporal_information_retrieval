        <p>A year after going down to electoral defeat, the Sandinista Front is searching for identity in a world without a powerful Soviet Union to arm and defend it, and in a country without right-wing dictators to fight.</p>
        <p>The Sandinistas, who rode to power in 1979 at the head of a popular insurrection against the Somoza family dictatorship, lost last year's presidential elections to an opposition coalition led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.</p>
        <p>Now it is debating the creation of a democratic political party, and its leaders say Marxism-Leninism and the idea of taking power by military means have been ruled out. But they seem uncertain, or divided, about what kind of political definition to take. Working documents for a party congress scheduled for July speak of "humanistic socialism," but some rank-and-file members wonder what that means, and others say it sounds too mild.  Next Election in 1996</p>
        <p>Former Vice President Sergio Ramirez Mercado, probably the leading theorist of the Sandinista Front, said it was "premature" to try to define the party more clearly now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez said he thought that by the next elections, in 1996, "this neo-liberal enthusiasm in the world will wane, and people will begin to think of alternative models for societies."</p>
        <p>"On the other hand," he continued, "we have to see what happens in Nicaragua, whether with Mrs. Chamorro's economic program the country can achieve stability, increase production, grow and create jobs. In that case, an opposition party has to think about what it can offer."</p>
        <p>On the personal level, the Sandinista leaders have developed in different directions. For some, who had passed their adult lives underground or in power, this is the first taste of anything like ordinary life.</p>
        <p>Former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra spent several months traveling in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf in an ostensible peace effort after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Mr. Ramirez gives speeches abroad and writes, in his first vocation.</p>
        <p>Former Interior Minister Tomas Borge, at age 61 the elder in the Sandinista leadership, is trying to establish a career as a celebrity interviewer for foreign newspapers and magazines. He is said to ask $10,000 to do articles on such figures as Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Fidel Castro of Cuba.</p>
        <p>Luis Carrion Cruz, at 38 the youngest member of what is now a seven-man Sandinista directorate, plans to enroll in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard in September to work toward a master's degree in public administration.</p>
        <p>Mexican-born Victor Tirado, who had a significant role in guerrilla days but a less significant government role, said he was hoping that some group in the United States would invite him for an expenses-paid visit.</p>
        <p>Others are more oriented inside Nicaragua. Bayardo Arce, who once combined journalism with guerrilla activities, now oversees the substantial press and broadcasting empire the Sandinistas have managed to retain. Jaime Wheelock Roman, former Agriculture Minister, is in charge of drafting the documents for the coming party congress.</p>
        <p>"The country has changed, and we have also changed," said Mr. Carrion, explaining why the Sandinista Front has to "modify and reorganize itself in the form of a democratic political party."</p>
        <p>He said the idea of an armed movement led by an all-powerful "vanguard" -- the national directorate -- had been appropriate during the years of fighting the authoritarian Somoza dynasty, but had been "debatable" in the years after 1979, and "definitively, in the present circumstances, it is inappropriate, incorrect and unnecessary."  Party Congress in July</p>
        <p>The debate and discussions now under way at all levels of the Sandinista Front, which will culminate in the congress in July, encompasses its past performance as well as its future shape. At the highest levels of the party, the debate is thought to be quite intense, even though it seldom comes into the open. In recent interviews, several members of the leadership gave only mild hints of the differences.</p>
        <p>"Any defeat brings trauma to a political party," Mr. Ramirez said, "but especially in a party like the Sandinista Front that didn't have defeat in its perspective in 1990."</p>
        <p>He said the Sandinista Front remained a political group "with strength, but one that didn't have the strength to win the elections." As a result, he said that in the next five years the Sandinista Front would have to present "a moderate program of consensus that will allow us to improve our standing with sectors of the population where we lost."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortega said the Sandinista Front, with more than 40 percent of the vote last year, had withstood the tide of change better than most Communist parties in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>"It's because we, at the time of the triumph of the revolution, had the vision to follow a different route, a plan with a mixed economy, political pluralism and Christian participation, different from that of Eastern Europe or Cuba," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortega said he did not want to think about 1996 yet. He said the Sandinistas needed to help Nicaragua achieve stability this year while at the same time defending their position in what he called "a new fight for property occurring in Nicaragua."</p>
