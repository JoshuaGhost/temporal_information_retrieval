        <p>The Lessons of History  By Michael Howard  217 pages. Yale University Press. $27.50.</p>
        <p>Reading "The Lessons of History," by Michael Howard, against the backdrop of the war in the Persian Gulf, it becomes all too evident that any study of modern history is inseparable from military history. That is one of the main points emerging from Mr. Howard's eloquent book of essays on the nature of armed conflict. Much as we might prefer to read about the forward march of civilization on the eve of the 21st century, the author forces us to ponder whether a world without war is possible in the near future.</p>

        <p>The Lessons of History  By Michael Howard  217 pages. Yale University Press. $27.50.</p>
        <p>Reading "The Lessons of History," by Michael Howard, against the backdrop of the war in the Persian Gulf, it becomes all too evident that any study of modern history is inseparable from military history. That is one of the main points emerging from Mr. Howard's eloquent book of essays on the nature of armed conflict. Much as we might prefer to read about the forward march of civilization on the eve of the 21st century, the author forces us to ponder whether a world without war is possible in the near future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard, professor of military and naval history at Yale and president of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, is sympathetic to the aspirations of people everywhere. But he says that aspirations can lead to convulsive reactions in the streets and, eventually, on the barricades and battlefields. He admires some heroic revolutionary leaders, as well as pragmatic technocrats from Moscow to Beijing, who are struggling to make their societies work. He finds it quite possible that war, in the sense of armed conflict between highly developed societies, may not recur. He even foresees that a stable framework for international order could become firmly established.</p>
        <p>Still, looking down the shell-pocked road of history, the author cautions: "Nevertheless violence will continue to erupt within developed societies as well as undeveloped, creating situations of local armed conflict often indistinguishable from traditional war and requiring the continuing exercise of military skills. We have, for better or worse, not yet reached a state of social development when the soldier will find no opportunity to exercise his profession and warrior values have become obsolete."</p>
        <p>Professor Howard wrote this two years before camouflaged American warriors fought in an alien desert and Scuds and Patriots began flying over the Middle East, but the picture he draws is all too familiar. After two World Wars, it's hard to distinguish local wars from large-scale wars, particularly when major powers find themselves engaged in ancient feuds between tribal nations that pump oil instead of growing rice or bananas.</p>
        <p>So the reader hopes for lessons from this distinguished military historian who knows of war from personal experience. He fought with the Coldstream Guards in the mountains of Italy during World War II when Fascism was crumbling and the dream of a more peaceful world was in the air. It's something of a disappointment not to find ready answers in the book, a disappointment not necessarily in the author but in the brutal realities of the world he describes:</p>
        <p>"We are left with a West whose wealth provides no relief from anxiety and turbulence; a socialist world which has now recognized with astonishing unanimity that its God has failed; and a third world which nothing can spare the strains and conflicts inherent in modernization. These are not exactly the 'broad, sunlit uplands' of which Winston Churchill once spoke, but the least that historians can do is to remind the world that there</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>no such uplands -- or rather that when we do find them, we will find also deeply shadowed valleys full of misery and despair. Each new generation is presented with new problems and new challenges, and analogies drawn from the past are likely to be more of a hindrance than a help in solving them. If the past has anything to teach us it is</p>
        <p>humility</p>
        <p>-- and suspicion of glib formulae for improving the lot of mankind."</p>
        <p>Well, then, what comfort is there in reading "The Lessons of History"? Nothing less than the pleasures of encountering a challenging mind, supported by a great store of information, delivered in graceful language. The essays in the book cover Prussia in European history; empire, race and war in pre-1914 Britain; the Edwardian arms race; Europe on the eve of World War I; the finest hours of Prime Minister Churchill and why he did not keep up with the changing times; the era that ended after the nightmare of Hitlerism and the Holocaust of World War II, and social change and some of the root causes of war.</p>
        <p>Rather diffidently, Professor Howard says, "History is what historians write, and historians are part of the process they are writing about." Still, he shows that a historian can indeed draw upon the past to foreshadow the design of coming events. In an essay written in 1988, which made the point that territory still remained a factor that could lead to war, he was prescient: "The one place in the world today where a global conflict might still conceivably originate is the Persian Gulf, without whose oil resources the West would be economically crippled."</p>
        <p>In "The Lessons of History," Professor Howard does hold out some hope for those who envision progress without warfare. He writes that there is a continuing obligation to insure that "nowhere in the world should poverty, illiteracy and grinding hardship" deprive people of opportunities for physical improvement and moral growth. And, in the end, he says that history can count: "The historical process, through the very challenges it poses and the responses it evokes, itself creates the morality of mankind. That seems to me a very good reason for studying it."</p>
