        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The deeper ailment you allude to in "Irish Victims of British Justice" (editorial, March 17) is oppression. Its victims number far more than the Birmingham Six. Danny McNamee and Dessie Ellis, for example, remain imprisoned in England, though the government has stated it cannot link them with offenses alleged.</p>
        <p>The Birmingham Six case was a shameless episode of hostage taking made possible by emergency and special statutes intended to deal with the conflict in Ireland. That conflict has made British legal sorcery a growth industry and provided tools for oppression like internment by remand, trial without jury, public immunity certificates to allow summary executions and a modified right to silence, to name but a few.</p>
        <p>What need is there for a speedier response by the latest Royal Commission? The commission's real purpose is not reform, but to play for time. If more people questioned the actions of British home secretaries in this judicial appeal, we might be celebrating an end to these colonial practices. Instead we lament their latest victims. MICHAEL J. CUMMINGS  National Director, Public Relations Irish Northern Aid Committee Albany, March 22, 1991</p>
