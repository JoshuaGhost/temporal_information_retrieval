        <p>Two futures brokers who were expelled from the industry and fined last year for cheating customers have been indicted on Federal criminal charges, according to the United States Attorney's office in Chicago. Norman Furlett and Ira Greenspon, who solicited customers for the defunct futures trading company GNP Commodities Inc., are charged with diverting more than $100,000 in profits from winning trades into their personal accounts while allocating losing trades worth more than $200,000 into their customers' accounts in 1986. If convicted on all counts, the two could each face up to 70 years in prison, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's office said.</p>
