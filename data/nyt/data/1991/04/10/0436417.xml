        <p>Rhode Island's Governor and Senators today pleaded for a Federal bailout of the state's private deposit insurance system, saying the state had been plunged into a financial crisis even worse than it suffered during the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>Gov. Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, shut down 35 credit unions and 10 banks on New Year's Day after the private Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation collapsed.</p>
        <p>Thirty institutions have since reopened with Federal insurance, but 15 others remain closed and their depositors' accounts frozen.</p>
        <p>"People have lost money set aside for weddings, had burial accounts frozen, lost homes and businesses," the Governor told the Senate Banking Committee. More than half the state's one million people have been affected, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sundlun is backing legislation, sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican. It would make a $500 million pool of Federal money available for low-interest loans to states in which private deposit insurance systems collapse. No more than $150 million could be lent to a state.</p>
