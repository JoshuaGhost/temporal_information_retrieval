        <p>Dr. Irwin Philip Sobel, a pediatrician and novelist, died yesterday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>He died of prostate cancer, said his son, Michael.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sobel was affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital for six decades and was head of its pediatrics department from 1962 to 1967. In that time he helped invent a three-way valve that sharply reduced the time required for a transfusion to exchange the blood of a newborn infant.</p>
        <p>He was also chief of pediatrics at the Lenox Hill School for the Deaf for 25 years. He retired in 1981.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sobel was the author of two novels, "The Hospital Makers," published in 1972, and "The Virus Killer" (1975), both of which dealt in an irreverent manner with goings-on in a supposedly fictitious metropolitan hospital.</p>
        <p>He was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Columbia College and of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In World War II, as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical Corps, he was chief of medicine at the 112th General Hospital in England.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sobel's only immediate survivor is his son, who lives in Manhattan.</p>
