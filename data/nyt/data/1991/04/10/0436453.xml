        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals spoiled Danny Jackson's Cub debut with three runs in the eighth inning today, and beat Chicago, 4-1, in the season opener for both teams.</p>
        <p>Jackson, one of the heroes for Cincinnati in the World Series sweep, signed a four-year deal with Chicago for $10.5 million after the season.</p>
        <p>With the score tied, 1-1, Felix Jose doubled with one out in the eighth off Jackson. Todd Zeile walked and Tom Pagnozzi singled to left to fill the bases. Paul Assenmacher then replaced Jackson for the Cubs.</p>
        <p>Jose Oquendo hit a roller to shortstop, but Shawon Dunston's throw to second was late as Jose scored the tie-breaking run on the fielder's choice. Pinch-hitter Craig Wilson singled off Assenmacher's glove as Zeile scored, and Rex Hudler's force-play grounder scored Pagnozzi.</p>
        <p>Byrn Smith (1-0), the St. Louis starting pitcher, gave up four hits in seven innings. Mike Perez pitched the eighth, and Lee Smith, a former Cub, retired the side in the ninth for the save.</p>
        <p>The Cards took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Bernard Gilkey walked with the bases loaded to score Pagnozzi. Dunston tied the score in the bottom of the inning when he led off with a home run into left-center field.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre of St. Louis was pleased with Oquendo's play. "Typical of the way we have to play," Torre said. "Run everything out and force the other team to make the plays." Pirates 4, Expos 3</p>
        <p>PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Tim Burke hit two batters and walked two during a two-run eighth-inning rally by Pittsburgh, and the Pirates, held scoreless for the first 15 innings this season, beat Montreal in a rain-delayed game.</p>
        <p>With the bases loaded and two out after Pittsburgh had rallied from a 3-0 deficit to tie the score, Burke hit Gary Redus to force in the winning run. The victory stopped the Expos' winning streak against Pittsburgh at five games.</p>
        <p>With the Expos leading, 3-2, reliever Steve Frey (0-1), the fourth of Montreal's five pitchers, walked Bobby Bonilla and allowed a Barry Bonds single in the eighth before being replaced by Burke. Burke hit Jeff King to load the bases, then walked pinch-hitter Mike LaValliere to tie the score. Jose Lind then grounded into a double play, but Burke hit Redus in the left elbow on the first pitch to force in the go-ahead run.</p>
        <p>Bob Kipper (1-0) worked a scoreless eighth for the victory before Bill Landrum pitched the ninth for the save. Blue Jays 4, Red Sox 3</p>
        <p>TORONTO (AP) -- Mark Whiten, a rookie who broke a tie with a run-scoring double in the sixth inning, Devon White and Joe Carter led the Toronto Blue Jays to victory.</p>
        <p>Left-hander Jimmy Key worked six innings for the victory and Tom Henke, the third Toronto pitcher, worked the ninth for the save.</p>
        <p>White and Carter, both of whom came in offseason trades, had two doubles apiece. White had three hits and scored twice. Carter drove in two runs.</p>
        <p>Rance Mulliniks started the sixth with a one-out walk before Whiten doubled into the left field corner off loser Greg Harris. The ball rolled around the corner long enough to allow Mulliniks to score without a throw to break a 2-2 tie. Indians 2, Royals 1</p>
        <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Cleveland knuckleballer Tom Candiotti pitched eight strong innings to spoil Mike Boddicker's Kansas City debut.</p>
        <p>Boddicker, who signed a three-year deal for $9.25 million over the winter after pitching for the American League East champion Boston Red Sox, gave up five hits and struck out three in a complete-game effort.</p>
        <p>Candiotti, 10-3 in his career against Kansas City, gave up one run, five hits, struck out five and walked one.</p>
        <p>Doug Jones, who led the Indians with 43 saves last season, retired the side in the ninth for his first save of 1991. A's 7, Twins 2</p>
        <p>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rickey Henderson moved within one of Lou Brock's all-time stolen-base record of 938. In the first inning he led off with a single and stole second base off Jack Morris. He reached safely on his first four times at-bat.</p>
        <p>Dave Henderson hit a three-run homer in the fourth inning for the A's.  BASEBALL</p>
