        <p>Applications for mortgages in March were double the level of March 1990 and should continue at higher levels through the summer, an executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said today.</p>
        <p>"We don't think this is just a blip," said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the mortgage group. "It looks like a trend that can continue."</p>
        <p>He said the number of mortgage applications that proceed to closing should remain at 20 to 30 percent higher than a year earlier through the summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lasko said about 40 percent of the mortgage applications were for refinancing, particularly as borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages converted to fixed-rate loans.</p>
        <p>"Refinancings are running 40 to 42 percent of applications this year; they were only 15 percent last year," he said.</p>
        <p>But he said a greater-than- average number of mortgages would fail to close. "Probably about 50 percent of the applications we have now will not close," he said. "There are a lot of people just out there shopping."</p>
