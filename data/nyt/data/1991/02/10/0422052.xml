        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>We wallpapered our bathroom with a solid vinyl, and the edges are now peeling. The walls are plaster, which we covered with wallpaper lining and then primed. We overlapped the vinyl wallpaper strips by about one-eighth inch, and these edges are curling back. I tried several adhesives, but none held up for long. Some places will not stick down at all. Any suggestions?</p>
        <p>A. There are a couple of things you did wrong. First, you should never use a wallpaper lining under a vinyl wallcovering, for the vinyl will pull the paper lining away from the wall. Second, you should not paint or prime a wallpaper or lining; this makes it very difficult to remove later. Third, never overlap the edges of vinyl, for it will not stick over itself in most cases. Your only solution is to strip everything off the wall and then start over.</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>The dry well in my yard is backing up and is apparently clogged. I have no idea how long the well has been in use. Assuming it is leaves, is there any product I can pour in to get rid of them without harming the lawn, or must I rebuild the well?</p>
        <p>A. I know of nothing you can pour in the well that will solve your problem. The only cure is to either uncover the well and clean it out, or to dig a new well and connect your gutters to it. To prevent this happening again, I suggest you cover the gutters with mesh guards so as to keep out leaves.</p>
