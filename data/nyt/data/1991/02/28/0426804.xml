        <p>ROGER VADIM made his debut as a stage director last week in Paris. He is directing VICTOR LANOUX and MARIE-CHRISTINE BARRAULT, the couple who starred in the popular movie "Cousin, Cousine." In "Same Time, Next Year," a comedy by BERNARD SLADE, Mr. Vadim has a hit. The Edward VII Theater has been sold out every night and the run will continue indefinitely, the management said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vadim was asked to direct the play because of his knowledge of American humor (he was married to JANE FONDA) and his compatibility with the actors (he is married to Miss Barrault).</p>
        <p>Mr. Vadim described the play as "a mixture of tears and laughter, satire and comedy."</p>
        <p>"It explores so many facets of culture, from women's liberation to hippies to the business ethic to the return to traditional values."</p>
        <p>The play, which first appeared on Broadway in 1975, tells of a man and a woman, each married to another person, who get together every year for a one-night stand. It was made into a 1978 movie starring Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn.</p>
