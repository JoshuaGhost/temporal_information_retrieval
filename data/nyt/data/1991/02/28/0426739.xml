        <p>The Ticketmaster Corporation said it would acquire Ticketron, its rival computerized ticketing agency. The Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster did not disclose terms of the deal for Ticketron, which is owned by the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment group, and is based in Landover, Md. Both companies are private.</p>
        <p>When it was formed eight years ago, Ticketmaster was the upstart that challenged the long-established Ticketron. Now Ticketmaster has become a larger cmpany, dominating sports and pop concert bookings and leaving Ticketron with few strengths except the legitimate theater business.
