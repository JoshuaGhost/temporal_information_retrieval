        <p>Stock prices turned mixed yesterday, with Soviet-Iraqi negotiations on all-out war or peace in the Middle East too close to call by the market's closing hour.</p>
        <p>Suggesting that investors were not buying or selling much of anything to any great extent, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chips fell 7.18, to 2,891.83, for the third loss in as many days.</p>
        <p>Well after the market had closed, the Soviet Union announced that Iraq had accepted a peace proposal, but the White House responded cautiously, saying it would study the proposal and prepare a response after discussions with its allies.</p>
        <p>At Instinet, the after-hours trading service, Richard Schenkman, vice president, said last night after the announcement, "We're open for business, but haven't seen a whole lot of interest in response to what's going on."  Drop in Volume</p>
        <p>On the Big Board yesterday, trading, which has been steadily dropping, fell to 180.8 million shares from 185.7 million the day before. Birinyi Associates said program buying lifted the Dow only 2.5 points throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Even so, 834 Big Board stocks advanced while 715 fell. Only 4 hit new lows, while 74 rose to new highs. One of the new highs was A. G. Edwards, the brokerage firm, which fell 3/8, to 28 1/4, after a reaching a new high of 29 1/8.</p>
        <p>"We're in a holding pattern," Jack Solomon, market technician for Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, said of the day's action.</p>
        <p>"We're waiting to see what the messengers and minions have to say between Baghdad and Moscow and, ultimately, for Washington's response."</p>
        <p>In a cautious upside forecast, he argued that "if we win the war and lose the peace, the market would go down in frustration." But, he added, "if we go into a land war and succeed -- and are not too bloodied in the process -- this market will crash through the 3,000 barrier in no time flat."</p>
        <p>The Dow soared last July to a record 2,999.75, sank to a low of 2,365.10 in October and has been building almost steadily since then. As of yesterday, the Dow was only a little more than 100 points below the record.  Deeper Recession Forecast</p>
        <p>While the most recent Government figures tend to suggest that inflation could still be a problem, and, therefore, make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to bring down interest rates to stimulate business, the Commodity Research Bureau index sank yesterday to 211.21, a new low for the year.</p>
        <p>Asked about the number, Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor for the index, said, "It means we're still on course for a deeper recession, and we're not coming out quick."</p>
        <p>"If we were to come out of recession by the next quarter, as so many now assume," he said, "we would have seen a reversal in the bear trend in commodity prices that began with the 1988 peak in grain prices."</p>
        <p>The decline, he said, is "across the board," except for cattle and cotton.</p>
        <p>With the Dow blue chips down, only moderately, changes among the 30 industrials were small. But I.B.M., which dozens of traders check even before checking the Dow to see where the market is going, dropped 2 3/8, to 135 1/2, with 1.6 million shares changing hands.</p>
        <p>Digital Equipment also fell, by 1 1/8, to 76 1/2; Apple Computer was down 2, to 59; Microsoft 2 3/4, to 100; System Software dropped 2 3/4, to 19 1/4, and General Motors E was off 1 3/8, to 41 1/4.</p>
        <p>Among advancing issues, Conner Peripherals rose 1 3/8, to 26 1/8; Gerber Scientific 1 1/8, to 11, and Adobe Systems 2 1/4, to 45 1/2. Bruce Lupatkin of Hambrecht &amp; Quist recommended Adobe because of several new products to be introduced in March.</p>

        <p>Tokyo Stocks Off Slightly</p>
        <p>TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 22 (Reuters) -- Stocks were down at midday today in Tokyo on news of the guarded reaction from Washington to the Soviet-Iraqi peace plan. At the end of the morning session, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was off 32.20 points, to 25,992.17.</p>
