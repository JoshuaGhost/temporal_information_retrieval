        <p>THERE is no sign indicating the location of one of the most unusual and exclusive eating places in Beijing, Family Li's Restaurant. Many customers spend hours trying to find it and get lost.</p>
        <p>But even if one knows the street address, trying to find the entrance can be daunting.</p>
        <p>But around the Chinese New Year (which began last Friday), there is one obvious clue: A large red banner proclaiming in bold characters "Chu men jian xi, " "When you come out of this door, happiness will meet you."</p>
        <p>And then there are the reservations: two to three weeks' wait for lunch and up to two months for dinner.</p>
        <p>Still, these obstacles have not deterred the likes of Lawrence Tisch, David Rockefeller, Donald Sutherland, the novelist Betty Bao Lord and the American, British, Canadian, Italian and Swiss ambassadors to China.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's primary appeal is the Imperial Palace cuisine that the Li family duplicates with fresh ingredients.</p>
        <p>Then again, the restaurant's popularity might be due to the singular experience of dining in the heart of a Chinese household with the entire family helping to cook and serve the food.</p>
        <p>Family Li's Restaurant has a colorful history, particularly for Beijing, where private restaurants are rare.</p>
        <p>Six years ago a young woman named Li Li graduated from the Chinese Social University with a degree in nutrition and won first prize in a nationally sponsored family dinner contest. Her cooking skills received a great deal of notice and she decided to put her publicity to work by opening a tiny restaurant in her family's home.</p>
        <p>Li Li's bedroom was converted into a dining room with one table, and the Lis, a family of six, assumed various duties.</p>
        <p>Her parents volunteered to do the daily shopping. Li Li and her older sister, Li Aiyin, prepared the dishes in the family's tiny kitchen. Her brother, Li Xiao Lin; younger sister, Li Ping, and Li Aiyin's husband, Wang Xiang Li, set the table and served the dishes.</p>
        <p>By establishing the first restaurant in her family, Li Li was continuing a heritage that traces to a great-grandfather who was a steward in charge of Life Affairs for the Imperial Court of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). He oversaw the running of the Imperial household and collected recipes from the Imperial chefs.</p>
        <p>Li Li's father, Li Shanlin, became fascinated with cooking as a child, watching the palace chefs create dishes and studying the recipes his father collected.</p>
        <p>During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960's, Mr. Li, a professor of applied mathematics, was barred from working and took up the task of cooking for his family. But the Red Guard destroyed the 300 Imperial recipes he had preserved, and he spent each day trying to recreate and record them.</p>
        <p>Li Li and Li Aiyin watched their father do the family cooking and memorized his technique and the recipes. At 15, Li Li began to experiment, trying to recreate some of the fine dishes of the Imperial Court. She eventually became the family cook. Her mother, Li Wang Xiao Chou, then a pediatrician, gave her lessons in nutrition, and her brother, helped her with unique cold-platter designs.</p>
        <p>From the start, Family Li's Restaurant was a great success. The first customers were invited guests from the Ministry of Health. Impressed, they told other officials and friends about their meal.</p>
        <p>Pu Ji, the younger brother of Pu Yi, China's last Emperor, also heard of Family Li and visited, for the nostalgia of sampling royal dishes. Soon, articles began appearing in the Chinese newspapers, and there hasn't been a quiet evening in the Li household since.</p>
        <p>The restaurant, which was initially open only on weekends, serves lunch and dinner every day, a heavy schedule: It takes about 12 hours to prepare every meal.</p>
        <p>"First, we plan the menu, trying to think about what's available," Mr. Li said in English in an interview. "Then every day, my wife and I go to the market, the Friendship Store, the Friendship Supermarket and the free markets looking for the ingredients.</p>
        <p>"We try to get the best and freshest products that are available for each dish."</p>
        <p>The family puts such emphasis on freshness that a fish swimming in their tank in the morning is likely to be the sweet-and-sour fish course at lunch.</p>
        <p>"We must clean the ingredients, cut and chop everything and make it ready before the guests arrive," Mr. Li said. "People usually leave after 10 o'clock, and then we have to clean up everything. So we usually don't get to bed until after midnight. The next day we start all over again with the shopping."</p>
        <p>Each meal is different, Mr. Li said. Lunch might begin with four cold dishes, including cold chicken shreds in a gingery Sichuan peppercorn sauce, pickled cucumber slices and tossed celery strips with mustard sauce.</p>
        <p>That might be followed by soft-fried scallops, pork tenderloin in a rice wine sauce, deep-fried prawns, stir-fried bean sprouts, a whole Mandarin fish in sweet-and-sour sauce, Peking duck with Mandarin pancakes and a delicate chicken soup with tender chunks of winter melon.</p>
        <p>For New Year's, Mr. Li said, preparations can be more elaborate. Most Chinese, including the Lis, will prepare chicken, pork, duck and fish in one meal, emphasizing the richness of the festivities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li is especially fond of serving tea-smoked chicken or pork, "wealth and more money fish" (a whole fish covered with sweet-and-sour sauce) and red-cooked pork with Mandarin pancakes.</p>
        <p>Li Aiyin has taken over as chef now that Li Li and Li Xiao Lin have gone to Australia, where she is continuing her studies in nutrition and beginning another restaurant venture.</p>
        <p>"From the beginning we had always assumed that Li Li might leave to get married or go study abroad," Mr. Li said. "That's why we deliberately named it Family Li's restaurant. All of our relatives and friends help."</p>
        <p>Since ingredients are so expensive, the family does not make much money from the restaurant (about 200 yuan a month, roughly $39).</p>
        <p>Prices tend to run about 80 yuan per person, or about $15, for a table of 8 to 12 people. Family Li's Restaurant is at 11 Yangfang Hutong, De Nei Dajie, in western Beijing. The telephone number is 011-86-1-601-1915.</p>
