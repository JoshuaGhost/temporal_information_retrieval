        <p>Bo obviously knows salary arbitration better than Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla.</p>
        <p>Bo Jackson, whose offensive production last season did not compare with that of the Pittsburgh Pirates' terrific twosome, opted yesterday to forgo his arbitration hearing, which had been scheduled for today, and emerged with $75,000 more than Bonds and only $25,000 less than Bonilla for the 1991 season.</p>
        <p>Jackson and the Kansas City Royals agreed to a $2,375,000 salary, making him the 25th player who filed for salary arbitration this year to receive a raise of $1 million or more. Last season, he had a $1 million salary, the result of an arbitration loss.</p>
        <p>Bonds and Bonilla, who also lost in arbitration a year ago, came back for more this year and lost again. Bonds, the National League most valuable player, will play for $2.3 million, and Bonilla, who has been in the major leagues a season and a half longer than Jackson, will earn $2.4 million.</p>
        <p>Based on the figures the three players submitted for arbitration, Jackson viewed his value as being less than that of the other two, or he was being more conservative -- or wiser. Jackson submitted an arbitration bid of $2.7 million, Bonds $3.25 million and Bonilla $3.475 million. However he determined his approach, Jackson emerged in better fiscal shape than Bonds and Bonilla after a poorer performance on the field.</p>
        <p>Last season, Jackson batted .272, hit 28 home runs and drove in 78 runs. Bonds batted .301 with 33 home runs and 114 runs batted in. Bonilla batted .280 with 32 home runs and 120 r.b.i. Bonds also had a .565 slugging percentage to .523 for Jackson, and a .406 on-base percentage compared with .342 for Jackson, who is also a Los Angeles Raiders' running back and a commercial king.</p>
        <p>Eric King and the Cleveland Indians settled on a $1.45 million salary before their scheduled hearing, giving the pitcher a raise of $1 million less $5,000. After earning $455,000 last season, King wanted $1.75 million for his 12-4 record and came closer to that figure than to the Indians' $950,000.</p>
        <p>Dan Pasqua accepted the Chicago White Sox offer of $800,000, more than doubling the $375,000 salary he received as a platooned designated hitter and outfielder. Oddibe McDowell of Atlanta agreed to a $925,000 salary, representing a more modest raise from the the $690,000 he earned last year.</p>
        <p>Cory Snyder of the White Sox and Jim Gantner of Milwaukee, who sought twice as much as the Brewers wanted to pay him, $2 million to $1 million, had their cases heard yesterday. Eleven players remain on the arbitration list, with three pitchers -- Jose Rijo of Cincinnati, Tom Candiotti of Cleveland and Dan Petry of Detroit -- scheduled for hearings today.</p>
