        <p>Eliot Feld's "Ah Scarlatti," presented by Feld Ballets/NY on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, starts out looking like a 1990's music visualization. Neatly ordered ranks of dancers cut through the air with just as precisely ordered hinging arms and legs. Solos for Lynn Aaron never let her stray far from the tethered-looking central axis of her body, even when they demanded a teasing play with balance. Elizabeth Simonson was lifted high with her legs stretched taut in a midair split. It all seemed to accentuate every beat of the Scarlatti piano sonatas to which the piece is set. Why did Mr. Feld care about this music, one wondered?</p>
        <p>But then a thaw set in with a fleet, ground-skimming solo by Geralyn Delcorso, a dancer who brings a compelling warmth to everything she does and who danced here with the excited edge of responding to a challenge. There followed one of Mr. Feld's most interesting explorations of the pas de deux, a well-oiled tangle of a duet that is full of quirky invention but also a feeling of serene passion. The choreographer's sometimes daunting braininess seems subverted here by a fascinated absorption with the mechanics of the pas de deux as well as with the music.</p>

        <p>Eliot Feld's "Ah Scarlatti," presented by Feld Ballets/NY on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, starts out looking like a 1990's music visualization. Neatly ordered ranks of dancers cut through the air with just as precisely ordered hinging arms and legs.

Elizabeth Simonson was lifted high with her legs stretched taut in a midair split. It all seemed to accentuate every beat of the Scarlatti piano sonatas to which the piece is set. Why did Mr. Feld care about this music, one wondered?</p>
        <p>But then a thaw set in with a fleet, ground-skimming solo by Geralyn Delcorso, a dancer who brings a compelling warmth to everything she does and who danced here with the excited edge of responding to a challenge. There followed one of Mr. Feld's most interesting explorations of the pas de deux, a well-oiled tangle of a duet that is full of quirky invention but also a feeling of serene passion. The choreographer's sometimes daunting braininess seems subverted here by a fascinated absorption with the mechanics of the pas de deux as well as with the music.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Neeck has the protean pliancy of a modern dancer and a quietly intense stage presence. Ms. Aaron's pulled-up ballet body is capable of understated dramatic nuance. And the two meet Mr. Feld more than halfway in some of the weirder configurations in the pas de deux, drawing the viewer even further into passages like one in which the reclining Mr. Neeck, grasping Ms. Aaron, is slowly drawn across the stage in her wake. Warmed by a sense of Mr. Feld's insights into the music and ballet, one watches the choreographer return to the more rigorous formality of the opening sequences with a good deal more enjoyment.</p>
        <p>Peter Longiaru was the pianist. The program was completed by "Charmed Lives," "Ion" and "Common Ground."</p>
