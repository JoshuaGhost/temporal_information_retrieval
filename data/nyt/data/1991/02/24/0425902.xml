        <p>Now that the Administration has unveiled its long-awaited plan to free banks from their Depression-era handcuffs, the real work begins: implementing the plan. The complicating factor in this case is timing. The recommendations come hot on the heels of the collapse of the savings and loan industry, a collapse that some wrongly insist is a foreshadowing of what's in store for banking.</p>
        <p>While I don't mean to minimize the serious problems facing commercial banks, I contend that the prophets of doom are way off the mark when they suggest banks are about to go the way of the savings and loans. Make no mistake, there will be casualties. Many well-known names might not survive as we know them today. But it won't be the industry Armageddon some are predicting.</p>
        <p>Commercial banks are undergoing the long-delayed, and very painful, evolution from a state-protected, centrally planned industry to one forced to cope with normal market forces. Ten thousand independent banks are simply too many banks -- period. The market is finally beginning to address that overcapacity. The Administration's proposal clearly will hasten this process. I have no doubt that when the period of consolidation is over, commercial banking in the United States will emerge stronger and more globally competitive.</p>
        <p>Unlike savings and loans, banks on the whole are extremely well capitalized -- with a total of more than $200 billion of equity capital standing guard against industry insolvency and taxpayer bailout. And capital standards have been going up for banks, not down. The industry remains strongly supervised and continues to fill a number of necessary and important economic functions.</p>
        <p>There is a sizable near-term hurdle to banking reform, though: As Congress prepares to take up the issue of modernizing the financial services industry, taxpayer outrage for being left holding the savings and loan bailout bag is justifiably loud in its ears. A $500 billion bill for obsolescence, ineptitude and fraud is not something anyone is likely to forget -- let alone want repeated. And clearly, the politicians and regulators are out to make sure it isn't.</p>
        <p>Here is one area in which the Administration does not go far enough. Open-ended deposit insurance, as we have seen, is a clear recipe for disaster. Retaining the right to selectively rescue some banks and not others only leaves the door open for unrestricted losses. Depositors need to be protected, certainly. Institutions do not. And the banking industry cannot afford to write the check for open-ended payments beyond $100,000.</p>
        <p>Commercial banks are not seeking deregulation in the sense of a reduction in regulation and supervision. They simply want to modernize and simplify products in line with changing market needs.</p>
        <p>Forcing a bank to have separate computer centers, separate boards and separate accounting records for each state in which it operates is just a mindless waste of resources. With modernization, regulatory supervision will remain in place and in force. Capital standards will remain strong. And risks will be managed. But the key to economic viability does not lie in preserving the status quo -- it lies in giving banks the freedom to serve their markets with new products and efficiency, not with an approach frozen in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>As Congress prepares to take up the issue of meaningful systemic reform, I urge it to recognize this and to consider how significantly different the banking and savings and loan industries are. It would be a national tragedy if they did not.  FORUM</p>
