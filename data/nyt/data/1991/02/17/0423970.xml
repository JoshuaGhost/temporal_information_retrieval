        <p>"Light Shining in Buckinghamshire" is a challenging play on the subject of revolution -- the English civil war of the 17th century.

        <p>"Light Shining in Buckinghamshire" is a challenging play on the subject of revolution -- the English civil war of the 17th century. Written in 1976, this was Caryl Churchill's first collaboration with the Joint Stock Theater Group, with playwright, actors and director immersing themselves in a historical canvas and creating a dramatic collage of a turbulent time.</p>
        <p>Theatergoers seeing the play in its United States premiere at the Perry Street Theater may find themselves disoriented by the swirl of events and even by the style of storytelling. In this New York Theater Workshop production, four actors and two actresses repeatedly switch roles while playing dozens of characters. Identification is often blurred.</p>
        <p>All this is as purposeful as it is demanding. The playwright seeks to give a comprehensive picture of the passions -- and paradoxes -- at the root of a rebellion that proved to be so consequential in English history.</p>
        <p>The play is interesting for itself and for its renewed relevance in periods of world crisis. It is also significant in terms of Ms. Churchill's career. In subsequent plays like "Fen" (about farm workers in England) and "Mad Forest" (about the recent Romanian revolution), she has refined her theatrical techniques and her uses of the collage form. Rough and occasionally repetitive, "Light Shining in Buckinghamshire" is definably an earlier work, but in it she was powered by her conviction and by her desire to illuminate the most complex of issues.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Churchill says in a prefatory note to the play, the belief in the millennium led to a war to establish heaven on earth. What was established instead was "an authoritarian parliament, the massacre of the Irish, the development of capitalism." In other words, the effects of the war can still be measured today. In the panoply of this densely populated play, we see children abandoned and men and women abused by those in power. One feels especially the plight of women at home and men recruited to be killed in battle without ever knowing what they are fighting for. Injustice replaces the law of the land.</p>
        <p>The playwright seems most concerned with recurrent themes and a collective consciousness. But in performance, individuals emerge: a woman who is beaten and driven from parish to parish for the simple fact that she is poor; the visionary (based on a real person) who looks behind the reign of terror and sees "a tiny spark of transcendent, unspeakable glory." Many scenes are glimpses on the run, others are extended confrontations and colloquies, as the play provides an object lesson as well as a group portrait of a country in extremis.</p>
        <p>In evident emulation of Max Stafford-Clark's original English production, Lisa Peterson, the director, has kept the play stripped to its Brechtian core. The actors perform with the sparsest scenery and props. Bill Clarke's design has a Shaker-like simplicity: a table that when upended serves as a pulpit; chairs that are hung on pegs. Occasional songs are heard, and bells are rung as a call to arms and to meetings.</p>
        <p>Under Ms. Peterson's impressive leadership, the cast is deft in its handling of the English atmosphere and material, with committed work from Philip Goodwin, Bill Camp, Shona Tucker, Gregory Wallace, Steve Hofvendahl and, especially, Cherry Jones. The austerity of the design is reflected in the performances.</p>
        <p>The play asks for the audience's concentration and for a certain basic familiarity with the civil war. In that sense, "Light Shining in Buckinghamshire" is a very English play; one can readily understand why it has taken so long to arrive here. But it is a play that commands one's attention and that can lead to enlightenment.
