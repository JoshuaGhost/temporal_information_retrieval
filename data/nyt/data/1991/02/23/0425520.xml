        <p>Retailers who cater to the wealthy and the merely affluent are finding out that things are bad all over. Stores freshly stocked with $1,200 spring suits and $2,000 dresses, in settings of rich mahogany paneling and artful decor, have only a trickle of customers.</p>
        <p>Around the country, big-name high-priced stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany &amp; Company and Nordstrom's say their customers, like those with more limited incomes, have sharply cut back their purchases because of concerns about the economy, the Persian Gulf war and their personal finances.</p>
        <p>That downturn is in stark contrast to the steadfast buying by affluent consumers last year, which economists and Government officials say helped offset the effects of the recession in its early months.</p>
        <p>Now much to the dismay of the retailers, their least recession-prone customers are staying away, behaving as if they have little if any disposable income. At many of the stores, lonely sales clerks at expensive perfume counters and designer dress boutiques are idle much of the time.</p>
        <p>As a result, the stores showing losses in their latest sales reports, for January, include Neiman Marcus, down one-half of 1 percent in same-store sales that month; Nordstrom's, down an estimated 1.5 percent, and Jacobson, based near Detroit, off 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Saks Fifth Avenue, the nation's largest specialty chain serving affluent customers, had what Mel Jacobs, its chairman and chief executive, called a difficult Christmas season. "Since then," he said, "the war has created another problem" to distract customers. He added, "We are seeing some reasonable reaction to new spring clothes," most of which are priced substantially under $2,000. "But it is hard to build up enthusiasm," he said.</p>
        <p>At Tiffany's, a spokesman said business "continues to track in the disappointing trend of the recent holiday season."</p>
        <p>Clifford Grodd, president and owner of Paul Stuart, the men's fashion specialty store, said: "It's psychological more than anything else, like not flying or traveling. Our 1990 business was so-so, and January business was erratic. Still, I think we are doing better than the average out there."</p>
        <p>Hopes for Spring Fashions</p>
        <p>As might be expected, retailing executives are nearly universal in their hope that new spring lines by Adolfo, Geoffrey Beene, Hickey Freeman and other designers will draw enough consumer interest to reverse the slump. And in fact, some specialty store executives say sales have picked up slightly this month.</p>
        <p>But one executive of a leading men's wear store, who refused to allow his or his company's name to be used, was not so optimistic. "I think we'll start seeing a real pickup in August," he said.</p>
        <p>The buying lag involves two layers of affluent shoppers, analysts say. One consists of the truly wealthy, who can afford to buy almost anything they want but who are holding off. In the second level are the high-salaried professionals, men and women alike, who are concerned about their jobs and the possibility of reduced pay or are already out of work.</p>
        <p>"The real focus is on the second group, those who are able to buy expensive clothes and durables but stop buying when their income is threatened," said Bernard Sosnick, retail analyst for the Deutsche Capital Group of New York.</p>
        <p>Henry D'Auria, retail analyst for Paine Webber Securities, said the regions most affected by the caution of the affluent are the East and West Coasts. "California is in an economic downturn while the Mid-Atlantic and New England states have been in one for a year or more," he said. "The reason is the business slowdown in the service sector first in the East and now in the West, where the defense industry is also sluggish." 'Recycling Their Clothes'</p>
        <p>In Boston, the Louis Boston store has had "somewhat erratic business," said Carmine Micciulla, the retailer's Boston sales manager. "Our $1,400 and $1,500 suits are selling better than our $2,000 models," he said, "But the price cutting by the department stores hurts us. And some customers tell us, 'I think I'll hold off with what I have till next season.' People are just recycling their clothes." Mr. Micciulla denied persistent reports that the retailer would soon close its two-year-old store on East 57th Street in Manhattan because of disappointing sales.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the dearth of affluent customers is cyclical. "In the 1980's, there was a buying boom of 'professional clothes' by both men and women," said Mr. Sosnick of Deutsche Capital. "It was a demographic and sociological trend. But then it reached saturation about the same time as the recession came. I think it will correct itself when the economy improves."</p>
        <p>Sandra Shaber, vice president and consumer economist for the Futures Group, a management consulting company in Washington, added: "I don't think that this slump in upscale clothing and other goods is simply a matter of falling confidence in the economy or because of the war. It reaches much further. We have tremendous overcapacity in production in the United States and a ratcheting-up of competition with retailers killing each other for market share. One day, Nordstrom is in and the next day customers go elsewhere. What we have is an overbuilt retail environment complicated by a recession."</p>
        <p>In the meantime, few upper-crust stores are unaffected.</p>
        <p>Bergdorf Goodman, which late last year opened a separate men's wear store opposite its main store at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street in Manhattan, has found "women's apparel sales slow," according to Ira Neimark, chairman and chief executive. "It has not been an exciting season," he said,</p>
        <p>Brooks Brothers said it had a "basically flat" business in January, which for retailers means losing ground to inflation. There has been a bit of a pickup this month, said William V. Roberti, the president and chief executive of the 52-store chain.</p>
