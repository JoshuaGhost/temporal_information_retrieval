        <p>With American flags and olive-drab war machines as his backdrops, President Bush sped through a made-for- television tour of three military bases today and thanked American troops and their families for "doing the hard work of freedom."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed enlivened by the cheering crowds and the chance to do what he likes best -- traveling and pressing the flesh -- as he broke out of six weeks' confinement in Washington and swooped down in his Boeing 747 for brief visits to Cherry Point Marine Air Station and the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina and this Army post near Savannah, Ga.</p>

        <p>With American flags and olive-drab war machines as his backdrops, President Bush sped through a made-for- television tour of three military bases today and thanked American troops and their families for "doing the hard work of freedom."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed enlivened by the cheering crowds and the chance to do what he likes best -- traveling and pressing the flesh -- as he broke out of six weeks' confinement in Washington and swooped down in his Boeing 747 for brief visits to Cherry Point Marine Air Station and the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina and this Army post near Savannah, Ga.</p>
        <p>Posing before batteries of television cameras, the President peered from a ladder into the cockpit of a Marine F/ A-18 fighter-bomber, cleaned an enormous plate of barbecued pork and hush puppies at a picnic with airmen's families at the Air Force base and inspected a rank of armored vehicles at Fort Stewart. He declared his resolve to defeat Iraq's Army to each of his audiences, mostly women and children.</p>
        <p>At the picnic in a pine copse on Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the second stop of the day, Mr. Bush paid tribute to Americans who had been captured in the war. "No foreign dictator can imprison the love of liberty that beats in the hearts of every American," he said. Meets Families of Missing</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush met privately with four families of airmen held prisoner in Iraq or listed as missing. The names of the families were withheld by the White House. There are two pilots listed as prisoners of war from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Col. David W. Eberly and Maj. Thomas E. Griffith, and two listed as missing in action, Maj. Donnie R. Holland and Maj. Thomas F. Koritz.</p>
        <p>At Fort Stewart, where the arrival of the President and the deployment of much of the base's fighting force to the gulf have left the streets virtually deserted, Mr. Bush told his audience that a ground war would not begin until the American military was ready.</p>
        <p>"We will conduct this conflict on our terms, on our timetable, not on Saddam Hussein's timetable," he said, raising his voice and pounding his fist on the lectern.</p>
        <p>There were echoes today of President Johnson's visits to American military bases in the Vietnam War, as well as important differences.</p>
        <p>Both Presidents used the visits to get away from the White House to a warmer, more personal setting and to boost their own morale as well as that of American servicemen and women and their families at places where they were assured of enthusiastic crowds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said here that his morale had been "darn good," but after visiting three military bases, he said, "I'm going on home to see Barbara with my morale sky high."</p>
        <p>As Mr. Johnson did before him, Mr. Bush offered patriotic calls to duty. "Achieving our goals will require time and sacrifice, but we will prevail, make no mistake about that," Mr. Bush said at the Marine air station, where he spoke in front of an F/A-18 fighter, a Harrier jump-jet, and two menacing Cobra helicopter gunships.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush was in a vastly different political and military position today thn the beleaguered Mr. Johnson, who visited military bases in 1967 and 1968 in part to avoid the swelling masses of antiwar protesters. Where Mr. Johnson pleaded with Americans in November 1967 to "show no crack in our courage, no split in our resolve," Mr. Bush drew cheers from his audiences today by citing the strong public support for the war recorded in opinion polls.</p>
        <p>He also claimed a decisive American victory in the battle for the skies over Kuwait. "Air superiority is an established fact now," he said. "The Iraqi Air Force is no longer a factor."</p>
        <p>At Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, more than two dozen women, many of them pushing baby carriages and wearing yellow ribbons on their lapels, shouted at Secret Service agents, White House aides and Air Force police who would not let them into the tight space between the camera platform and Mr. Bush's podium.</p>
        <p>"We're all wives of deployed airmen," said Heather Madison, whose husband, Jeffrey James Madison, is in the Persian Gulf. "We've been here since 7 A.M. today and they won't let us in. This is supposed to be for us."</p>
