        <p>The owner of a grocery store in Queens said yesterday that he wanted to work with community leaders to end a boycott of his store as the number of protesters dwindled to a handful and business appeared to be brisk.</p>
        <p>The call for a boycott of the C-Town Supermarket, at 57th Avenue and 97th Street, near the Lefrak City housing complex in Elmhurst, was made after an employee of the store was arrested last week and charged with assaulting an 11-year-old black boy.</p>
        <p>About 40 people, carrying signs and urging people not to shop at the store, picketed in front of the store on Saturday. As six milled around the store entrance yesterday, the owner, Francis Ahn, a Korean-American, said that he planned to meet with local leaders, tenants and politicians this week to settle the dispute.</p>
        <p>"My main concern is not just the picketers out there, but the total misunderstanding of each other," Mr. Ahn said, as the sound of the protesters' bullhorn filtered into a second-floor office in the store. "My main interest is reconciling the situation."  Compared to Flatbush Boycott</p>
        <p>The pickets, as well as some neighbors, said they remained angry and would not shop in the store. Some residents said the employees seemed suspicious of black customers, comparing the incident to the boycott of a Korean-American grocery in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>"I think they have some problems in dealing with certain ethnic groups, I'll say it that way," said Marilyn Roberts, 49 years old, who said she stopped shopping at C-Town in November after employees had followed her around the store.</p>
        <p>In the Brooklyn boycott, the manager of the Red Apple Grocery at 1823 Church Avenue was accused of slapping a black shopper. The case ignited tensions between blacks and Asian-Americans. The manager was acquitted of the charges.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the Elmhurst boycott said one major difference between the incidents was that the boy, Bobby Yates, 11, whom the employee is accused of assaulting, is a child.  Dispute With Employee</p>
        <p>The police said the confrontation started after the boy had gone to the store with his mother, Cynthia, and became embroiled in a dispute with the employee, Kim Yon Cha.</p>
        <p>Accounts of what occurred differ. Ms. Yates has said that Mr. Kim grabbed the boy from behind and threw him into a rack of shelves, causing bottles to fall on his head, and that her son was locked in a freezer for a half-hour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahn said Mr. Kim chased Bobby after he had knocked down merchandise and spilled a large bottle of detergent. Mr. Ahn said Mr. Kim took Bobby, who he said was a trouble-maker who sometimes shoplifted, to a back room for a few minutes "for a talk."</p>
        <p>Many customers of the store in the predominantly black and Hispanic area said they had decided to shop at C-Town because they doubted the account of the assault or did not know enough about the incident.</p>
        <p>"I really do have to eat, and this is the cheapest place I can find," Rosa Villagran, 27, a receptionist, said. "No matter what, it's not stopping me."</p>
