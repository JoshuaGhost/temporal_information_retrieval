        <p>Following are excerpts from an address by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq broadcast tonight by the Baghdad radio. The excerpts were translated by The Associated Press from a transcript transmitted by the Iraqi News Agency.  Iraqis, your enemy believed it was capable of achieving its goals and reversing the course of history, and when he failed, he resorted to direct armed aggression. Here we are in the fourth week of this aggression with the Iraqis becoming more firm in their faith, and shining out more in front of the whole world.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from an address by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq broadcast tonight by the Baghdad radio. The excerpts were translated by The Associated Press from a transcript transmitted by the Iraqi News Agency.  Iraqis, your enemy believed it was capable of achieving its goals and reversing the course of history, and when he failed, he resorted to direct armed aggression. Here we are in the fourth week of this aggression with the Iraqis becoming more firm in their faith, and shining out more in front of the whole world.</p>
        <p>The resistance of our heroes to the warplanes and rockets of aggression and shame is the strongest indication of the steadfastness, faith and light in the hearts of the Iraqis and their great readiness not to give up the role willed to them by God, the will to which they responded, faithfully and obediently.</p>
        <p>All the good people will be victorious as Iraq, and victory will restore to the Iraqis all the requirements for a free and honorable living that they will merit as a reward for their patience and steadfastness.</p>
        <p>Those who look for triumph should search for it not outside the great chapter of time that has elapsed, because it exists in each hour of the confrontation, in each day and week since the first hour of the siege, . . . since the first day of the armed confrontation until the last day and hour, God willing.</p>
        <p>Those who question when and how aggression was defeated should see it in the first moment that the President of the so-called greatest country was forced -- as he said -- to take the decision of war after the decision of the embargo instead of dialogue, and to ally against us those whom he did bring together when America's power looked so small to him, or thus God willed it.</p>
        <p>With this he lost his prestige and made America lose its prestige as the biggest, or greatest, nation, as he calls it.</p>
        <p>Bush lost his presitige when he lost conviction and lost the ability to convince through dialogue in order to avoid the course of using arms.</p>
        <p>He lost prestige when he brought in the arms which the West had intended against the Warsaw Pact, against one of the countries of the third world, which is an Arab country.</p>
