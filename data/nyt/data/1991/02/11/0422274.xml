        <p>Roberta Alexander does not possess the most lustrous of sopranos, but she remains one of our most appealing artists, in opera but especially in song and double-especially in American song. On Friday night at Weill Recital Hall, an intimate space that boxed in her voice and turned it edgier than usual, she still managed to triumph in the Barber and Ives material after the intermission.</p>
        <p>Not that the first half, devoted to Dvorak's "Zigeunermelodien" (Op. 55), in German, and Debussy's "Ariettes Oubliees," was negligible. Miss Alexander sang them warmly and surely, but without the reserves of warmth, humor and all-round idiomatic assurance she brings to American composers.</p>

        <p>Roberta Alexander does not possess the most lustrous of sopranos, but she remains one of our most appealing artists, in opera but especially in song and double-especially in American song. On Friday night at Weill Recital Hall, an intimate space that boxed in her voice and turned it edgier than usual, she still managed to triumph in the Barber and Ives material after the intermission.</p>
        <p>Not that the first half, devoted to Dvorak's "Zigeunermelodien" (Op. 55), in German, and Debussy's "Ariettes Oubliees," was negligible. Miss Alexander sang them warmly and surely, but without the reserves of warmth, humor and all-round idiomatic assurance she brings to American composers.</p>
        <p>The Ives group at the end ranged widely among this remarkable eccentric's varied oeuvre, emphasizing the comic and the grotesque without slighting his sober side.</p>
        <p>But Barber's "Hermit Songs" (Op. 29) were the highlight of the night. Once recorded by both Leontyne Price (with the composer at the piano) and Eleanor Steber, they set Irish texts of the 8th through the 13th centuries in modern English versions, concerning the joys and tribulations of solitude and the contemplation of Christian mysteries, to wonderfully wise and lovely music. Miss Alexander caught their varied moods with spirited insight. And her voice proved ever responsive to the technical and interpretive demands she placed on it, and ever faithful to Barber's intentions.</p>
        <p>Warren Jones was the helpful accompanist.</p>
