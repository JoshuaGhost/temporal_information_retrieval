        <p>A 19-year-old man was arrested Monday night and accused of stabbing a 16-year-old girl to death in Central Islip over the weekend after she resisted his attempt to rape her, the Suffolk County police said today.</p>
        <p>The nude body of the girl, Kelly Gutierrez, was discovered along a shortcut through a wooded area of Central Islip by a neighbor on Saturday morning. Miss Gutierrez had left a get-together at a girlfriend's house at 65 Commercial Boulevard at 2 A.M.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at police headquarters here today, Detective Lieut. John Gierasch said Roberto T. Rivera, who rented a basement apartment in the same Commercial Boulevard house, left the house after Miss Gutierrez and used the shortcut to overtake her. He said the police believe Mr. Rivera accosted her at knifepoint near her home on Yalta Drive.</p>
        <p>The police said he forced the girl into the woods, made her undress, and stabbed her 13 times in the chest and back when she tried to resist.  Held Without Bail</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera, a forklift operator at the Interco Parts Corporation in Hauppauge, pleaded not guilty today at his arraignment on a charge of second-degree murder in First District Court in Hauppauge. Judge Anthony Corso ordered him held without bail at the Riverhead county jail.</p>
        <p>The authorities said additional charges may be filed later. They said tests performed by the Suffolk County Medical Examiner showed that Miss Gutierrez was not raped.</p>
        <p>Randall Hinrichs, a Suffolk County assistant district attorney, said that in oral and written statements, Mr. Rivera recounted that at one point during the attack he put down the knife, and that Miss Gutierrez grabbed it and tried to stab him until he wrested the weapon away and plunged it repeatedly into her body.</p>
        <p>"She was definitely fighting for her life," said Mr. Hinrichs outside court today. "There's no question about that."</p>
        <p>Detective Lieutenant Gierasch said a knife handle found near the body matched handles on a set of kitchen knives at the house where Mr. Rivera rented the basement apartment from his aunt. He said Mr. Rivera and Miss Gutierrez knew each other but were not close. "We don't believe they ever had a relationship," he said. Previous Arrests</p>
        <p>He said members of the household where Miss Gutierrez was visiting confirmed that Mr. Rivera had gone out shortly after Miss Gutierrez departed for home, and returned later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinrichs said Mr. Rivera had been arrested on three other occasions on misdemeanor charges.</p>
        <p>The police said Miss Gutierrez usually called home to her foster parents, Donald and Cheryl Shaffer, to ask for a ride if she was out late. But Sgt. William Pepper said she might have been unable to do so in this case because her girlfriend's mother was sleeping in the room with the telephone, and the door was locked.</p>
        <p>Adrienne Carr, a spokeswoman for Little Flower Children's Services, a Catholic child-care agency that had custody of Miss Gutierrez, said: "She had a very sad life, but she was resilient and so courageous. Her life was not a waste because she experienced love and gave love, and that is more than a lot of people do in a lifetime."</p>
