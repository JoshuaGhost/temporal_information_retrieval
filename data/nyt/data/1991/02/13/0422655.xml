        <p>Sports officials from North and South Korea agreed today to form the first unified Korean teams since their country was divided in 1945.</p>
        <p>The agreement, if carried out, could have important ramifications for efforts to relax the cold-war confrontation in Northeast Asia.</p>
        <p>After talks at the village of Panmunjom on the North-South frontier, the officials said they had agreed to enter joint teams in the world table tennis championships in Japan in April, and the World Youth soccer championship in Portugal in June.</p>
        <p>The agreement is an outcome of 28 years of on-and-off talks about getting players from North and South Korea to play on the same side. Signs of Reduced Tensions</p>
        <p>Agreement on the principle of forming a joint table-tennis team had been reached last month, but differences emerged then over how the team should be selected, trained and managed.</p>
        <p>The agreement follows six months of efforts to relax tensions between North and South Korea, including three rounds of talks between their Prime Ministers.</p>
        <p>So far those talks have produced no agreement on their stated aim of easing the political and military confrontation on the peninsula.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, there were other signs of relaxation in North-South relations last year. The national soccer teams played each other twice -- once in Pyongyang and once in Seoul. And parties of musicians from the North and the South performed in each other's capitals. Showing Progress to Tokyo</p>
        <p>North Korea, which last month began talks on establishing diplomatic relations with Japan, is likely to come under Japanese pressure to maintain this new atmosphere in North-South relations.</p>
        <p>Japan has assured South Korea that progress in its talks with North Korea will depend on progress in the North-South dialogue.</p>
        <p>North Korea is in desperate need of Japanese money to shore up its tottering economy, so it must be able to demonstrate to Japan that the North-South dialogue is making progress, Korean analysts say.</p>
