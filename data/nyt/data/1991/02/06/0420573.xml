        <p>A Federal appeals court in Chicago has ruled that a computerized system for trading options on Government securities could be approved for operation by the Securities and Exchange Commission without classifying the system as a securities exchange.</p>
        <p>The ruling on Monday upheld the commission's approval of an application of the Delta Government Options Corporation to act as a clearing agent for the system. The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange had opposed the application, saying the system constituted a securities exchange and would have to register as such.</p>
        <p>According to the opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the commodities exchanges opposed the system for competitive reasons. By requiring the system, which intends to allow open access to many institutional traders, to register as an exchange, all financial institutions trading through the system would have to register as brokers. Ownership and control of the system would then have to be turned over to the traders, who would then be "members" of the new exchange.</p>
        <p>The result of such cumbersome requirements, according to the court, is that "the system would be kaput."</p>
