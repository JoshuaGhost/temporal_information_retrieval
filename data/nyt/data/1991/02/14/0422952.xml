        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Banks Are Looking a Lot Like S.&amp; L.'s" (Op-Ed, Jan. 28), Prof. Edward Kane combines factual errors and faulty logic to level the serious charge that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is deceiving the American people about the extent of the problems in the banking industry and the deposit insurance fund.</p>
        <p>For the record, here are a few facts to counter Mr. Kane's fanciful assertions:</p>
        <p>* Mr. Kane says the F.D.I.C. "is taking advantage of accounting and regulatory discretion to conceal from taxpayers the fact and depth of its insolvency." The F.D.I.C. follows generally accepted accounting principles, and its financial statements are audited by the General Accounting Office and its own independent inspector general, as well as reviewed by appropriate Congressional committees. It would take a widespread conspiracy to achieve the deception Mr. Kane alleges.</p>
        <p>* Mr. Kane contends that the F.D.I.C.'s problem bank list has been shrinking dramatically because of "accounting gimmicks" that mask the condition of the banks. The F.D.I.C. has reported that the assets of banks on the problem bank list increased to $409 billion at the end of 1990, the highest in F.D.I.C. history, up from $236 billion at the end of 1989. The F.D.I.C. is not fooled by accounting gimmicks and is not ignoring them when analyzing the actual condition of these institutions.</p>
        <p>* Mr. Kane claims that the F.D.I.C. "controls the timing of individual bank failures" and that it unnecessarily delays bank closings, perhaps at great cost to the taxpayer. As a banking professor, Mr. Kane ought to know that the F.D.I.C does not decide when to close a bank; that is the decision of the state chartering authorities or the Comptroller of the Currency. The F.D.I.C., as well as other bank regulators, believes that nonviable banks should be resolved without delay.</p>
        <p>Professor Kane's conspiracy theory about an F.D.I.C. that is misleading the public, his call for a law to impose "penalties of fraud" against Federal regulators who fail to make honest and timely reports of deposit insurance losses and his comparisons of the F.D.I.C. to the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation might make for good classroom dramatics, but bear little relation to reality.
