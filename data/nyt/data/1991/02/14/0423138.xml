        <p>Back in 1962, "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" was a half-campy horror vehicle -- based on a novel by Henry Farrell -- for two aging superstars of the silver screen, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, appearing for the first time together.</p>
        <p>They played former film stars living alone in a crumbling Los Angeles mansion. Jane Hudson (Davis) had been a child performer. Her younger sister Blanche (Crawford) later went on to even greater fame, only to have her career cut short by an car accident that left her paralyzed and in the increasingly demented clutches of "Baby" Jane. The black-and-white movie, produced and directed by Robert Aldrich, was a wonderfully creepy hoot, nominated for several Academy Awards, including a best actress bid for Miss Davis.</p>

        <p>Back in 1962, "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" was a half-campy horror vehicle -- based on a novel by Henry Farrell -- for two aging superstars of the silver screen, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, appearing for the first time together.</p>
        <p>They played former film stars living alone in a crumbling Los Angeles mansion. Jane Hudson (Davis) had been a child performer. Her younger sister Blanche (Crawford) later went on to even greater fame, only to have her career cut short by an car accident that left her paralyzed and in the increasingly demented clutches of "Baby" Jane. The black-and-white movie, produced and directed by Robert Aldrich, was a wonderfully creepy hoot, nominated for several Academy Awards, including a best actress bid for Miss Davis.</p>
        <p>Now adapted for television in a new script by Brian Taggert, "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" -- Sunday at 9 P.M. on ABC -- is a vehicle for two actresses who are still very much in their prime and are indeed sisters, Vanessa Redgrave and Lynn Redgrave. One of the executive producers is William Aldrich ("The Sheltering Sky"), son of Robert. A network release crows that the production marks the first time the Redgrave sisters have worked together. It might also be noted that they are currently appearing in a London production of Chekhov's "Three Sisters."</p>
        <p>Lynn Redgrave, the younger of the sisters by about six years, gets to play the far more juicy role of the older Jane who, when not being downright macabre, is slugging vodka from a bottle and then spritzing herself with mouthwash. Poor Blanche has little more to do than play the helpless victim, spending most of her time trussed up and trying to scream though her taped mouth, certainly an uncharacteristic situation for the outspoken Vanessa Redgrave.</p>
        <p>"Baby Jane," directed by David Greene ("Friendly Fire," "Fatal Vision"), retains its more grotesque touches, most notably in the meals of live worm sandwiches and roast puppy that Jane keeps whipping up for poor Blanche. But this version of the story takes a somewhat broader tack by getting outside the Hudson mansion frequently to pounce on a Los Angeles that, at least on its seamier fringes, is not much more sane or wholesome than the pathetic Jane.</p>
        <p>There is, for instance, Billy Cork (John Glover), the seedy film buff who becomes Jane's manager, puts her into a two-bit club act and then suddenly appears with her on stage playing Blanche in drag. Behind Jane and Billy on the streets of Los Angeles looms a giant mural with the spectral figures of Bette Davis, James Dean and Clark Gable, each of whom had nothing to do with the others. They are merely grabbag elements of the pop psyche.</p>
        <p>The mechanics of the plot won't bear close scrutiny. The final scene takes place on a public beach, and there is simply no way that Jane, by now totally crazed and murderous, could have dragged Blanche there without being arrested on the spot. But these are quibbles in this kind of exercise. The Redgrave sisters dig in with gusto, Vanessa stoic in her short-cropped platinum hair, Lynn quite bizarre in girlish pigtails and cotton dresses. And Mr. Glover demonstrates once again his uncanny ability to depict memorably sleazy outcasts.</p>
        <p>All in all, the old chestnut can deliver a walloping scare or two.  What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
