        <p>Lower winter demand and higher oil supplies sent the average price of gasoline down nearly 5 cents nationwide in the last two weeks, almost to its price before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, the Lundberg Survey reported today.</p>
        <p>The average price of all grades of gasoline at full- and self-service stations, including taxes, was $1.20 a gallon on Friday, according to the biweekly survey of more than 13,000 stations.</p>
        <p>Gasoline prices have dropped 4.97 cents since Feb. 8. The average price stood at $1.17 before the Aug. 2 invasion.</p>
        <p>Gas prices peaked at $1.47 a gallon on Oct. 19. Prices have since fallen an average of 21.8 cents a gallon despite a 5-cent Federal gasoline tax that took effect on Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>At self-service stations, which account for more than 80 percent of sales, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline was $1.07 a gallon on Friday. Premium unleaded was $1.23 a gallon, and regular leaded was $1.04.</p>
        <p>At full-service stations, regular unleaded sold for $1.39 a gallon, premium unleaded for $1.53 and regular leaded for $1.38.</p>
