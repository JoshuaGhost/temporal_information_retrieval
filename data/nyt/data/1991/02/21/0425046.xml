        <p>In a move that appeared to further weaken President Bush's proposal to shift $15 billion in Federal assistance from Federal to state control, a spokesman for the nation's governors told the Senate today that the states have no interest in assuming control over community development funds or other programs whose loss would threaten the cities.</p>
        <p>The move came at a Senate Budget Committee hearing that also brought angry testimony from two big-city Mayors, David N. Dinkins of New York and Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, and strong hints from Democratic members that the President's proposal would have tough sledding in the Democratic-controlled Congress.</p>

        <p>In a move that appeared to further weaken President Bush's proposal to shift $15 billion in Federal assistance from Federal to state control, a spokesman for the nation's governors told the Senate today that the states have no interest in assuming control over community development funds or other programs whose loss would threaten the cities.</p>
        <p>The move came at a Senate Budget Committee hearing that also brought angry testimony from two big-city Mayors, David N. Dinkins of New York and Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, and strong hints from Democratic members that the President's proposal would have tough sledding in the Democratic-controlled Congress.</p>
        <p>Many members of Congress, particularly Democrats, view the proposal as a move to starve the cities and eventually to wean them off much Federal assistance.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Bush's proposal, $15 billion in money now being made available to state and local governments under various specific programs would be turned over exclusively to the states as block grants, to be parceled out as the states deem necessary. The proposal, first mentioned by the President in his State of the Union Message last month, immediately drew criticism from the nation's mayors but won expressions of pleasant expectation from most, though not all, of the governors.</p>
        <p>In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee today, Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican who is vice chairman of the National Governors' Association, said the governors supported the block grant concept. Easing the Cities' Fears</p>
        <p>But Governor Ashcroft, who said he spoke for the nation's governors, made a clear attempt to lessen the fears of cities that the President's proposal will cheat them, telling the committee that "the governors are not interested in including grants that are currently targeted to local government."</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration did not specify what programs would be shifted to block grants, instead providing a list of programs as examples of what the states might take over.</p>
        <p>What particularly outraged the mayors was inclusion on the list of $3.1 billion in Community Development Block Grants for housing, parks, child care and other social services. Urban areas now get two-thirds of that money, and the states get the rest.</p>
        <p>Mayor Flynn and Mayor Dinkins, along with Mayor William J. Althaus of York, Pa., also testified later before the House Budget Committee. They said that because most legislatures were dominated by rural and suburban interests, cities could get short shrift if the states took control of money now earmarked for the cities.</p>
        <p>But Governor Ashcroft said he and the other governors would specifically exclude the Community Development Block Grant program "and would not threaten resources that are now being made available to the cities."</p>
        <p>While the mayors welcomed the concession, Mr. Althaus said a compromise was not acceptable to the cities. "We would insist that this particular proposal be taken off the table," he said. "It is not workable and not in the interest of the people concerned."</p>
        <p>Mr. Flynn told the House committee that the proposal was a diversionary tactic intended to get cities and states warring among themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinkins, like the other mayors, aimed most of his fire at the block grant proposal, contending that it amounted to an "abandonment" of the cities.</p>
