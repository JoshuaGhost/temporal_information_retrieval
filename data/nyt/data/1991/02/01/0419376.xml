        <p>Wheaties may be "the Breakfast of Champions," but when it came to designing a box honoring the National Football League champion Giants, the folks at General Mills didn't pay too much attention to which Giants actually played in the Super Bowl championship.</p>
        <p>One of the seven players featured on the cover is Phil Simms, the injured quarterback, whose replacement, Jeff Hostetler, led the Giants through the playoffs to their Super Bowl victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.</p>
        <p>"It really had nothing to do with how anyone did in the Super Bowl," said a company spokesman, Brian Harris. "They just wanted a representative sample of seven high-profile athletes."</p>
        <p>The others are Sean Landeta, Reyna Thompson, Bart Oates, Pepper Johnson, Mark Bavaro and Ottis Anderson.</p>
        <p>More than 250,000 Giants boxes have been distributed in the New York City area, but there is an anomaly. They are all 18-ounce regular-size Wheaties boxes. There is no giant-size Giants box.</p>
