        <p>A top Soviet military officer said in an interview published today that the United States had clearly underestimated President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.</p>
        <p>"The Americans manifestly underestimated Saddam Hussein," the officer, Lieut. Gen. German Starodubov, a deputy head of the Soviet general staff's administration, told the Communist Party Central Committee's weekly newspaper.</p>
        <p>"They supposed that after the first bombings he would either give up or throw himself headlong into some sort of adventure," he said. "But you could hardly expect thatof an opponent who had just spent eight years fighting in the desert," said the general, referring to Iraq's eight-year war with Iran.</p>
        <p>General Starodubov also said the Soviet Union had information that showed the allies had largely failed to deliver a knockout blow in the first days of the war.</p>
        <p>The allied forces started the war by heavily bombing military targets and soon asserted major successes, saying they had destroyed many of Iraq's Scud missile launchers.</p>
        <p>But the Soviet general said that in many cases the planes had been bombing fake launchers.</p>
