        <p>An international group of nine prominent specialists in ancient Near Eastern history and culture has petitioned the United States Government to "take every possible measure to protect" the museums and archeological monuments of Iraq.</p>
        <p>The letter from the group, which is led by Robert McC.

        <p>An international group of nine prominent specialists in ancient Near Eastern history and culture has petitioned the United States Government to "take every possible measure to protect" the museums and archeological monuments of Iraq.</p>
        <p>The letter from the group, which is led by Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, said: "As specialists in the antiquities and history of Mesopotamia, we share with scholars in many countries including Iraq a special responsibility for this crucial segment of our common cultural heritage."</p>
        <p>The letter was delivered to April Glaspie, United States Ambassador to Iraq, this week.</p>
        <p>Ms. Glaspie did not return telephone calls to her office at the State Department in Washington yesterday.</p>
        <p>The letter spoke of the danger from bombing to archeological monuments like the sixth- or seventh-century Arch of Ctesiphon, one of the world's largest arches, which is near an Iraqi nuclear plant; the ancient city of Ur, which adjoins an airbase, and several Iraqi museums that hold precious Assyrian reliefs, royal tomb offerings and an extraordinary collection of clay tablets with early cuneiform writing.</p>
        <p>These remains, the scholars declared, "are a priceless heritage of all mankind."</p>
        <p>The so-called fertile crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that is modern Iraq, is believed to have been the birthplace of urban, literate civilization.</p>
        <p>The idea for the letter originated in a conversation last Friday between Mr. Adams, who is known for his study of ancient irrigation systems in Iraq, and Prudence O. Harper, curator of the department of ancient Near Eastern art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>
        <p>"I was concerned," Ms. Harper said, "that there might not be an awareness in our Government and the coalition of the existence of important cultural remains in Iraq."</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams said that after discussing the matter with several colleagues, he called Ms. Glaspie at the State Department and delivered a draft letter to her.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Adams and Ms. Harper, those who signed the letter are McGuire Gibson, of the University of Chicago; Mogens Trolle Larsen, Copenhagen University; Erle V. Leichty, University of Pennsylvania; Hans-J. Nissen, Free University of Berlin; J. Nicholas Postgate, Cambridge University; David B. Stronach, University of California at Berkeley, and Irene J. Winter, Harvard University.</p>
