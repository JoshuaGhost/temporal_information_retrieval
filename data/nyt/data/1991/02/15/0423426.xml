        <p>At a late date in his career, George R. Hargreaves has been handed a challenge by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. He has been named as the next president and chief executive of Goodyear's Celeron Corporation subsidiary, generally acknowledged to be the company's white elephant.</p>
        <p>Celeron, which runs the All American Pipeline, an oil pipeline stretching from California to Texas, posted a loss of $52.9 million last year and was a heavy contributor to Goodyear's $38.3 million loss for the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hargreaves, 61 years old, is currently vice president and treasurer of Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio. He will take over the Houston-based Celeron on March 1. Robert W. Milk, who currently runs Celeron, will then go on special assignment until April 30, when he retires at age 65.</p>
        <p>"Celeron and its All American Pipeline represent a considerable opportunity and challenge for its management team," Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Celeron has been hurt by low oil prices and domestic production in recent years. An increase in the price of oil, however, could lift the pipeline's prospects.</p>
        <p>Goodyear got into the oil business in 1983 as a move to diversify. It bought Celeron and the All American Pipeline Company for about $800 million. The pipeline was folded into Celeron, and Celeron has since sold many of its other assets.</p>
        <p>Goodyear spent an additional $1 billon to construct the 1,225-mile pipeline. The pipeline has never run at anywhere near capacity.</p>
        <p>"Circumstance changed, economics changed," Mr. Milk, has said of the project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hargreaves was in Houston yesterday, out of the office, and could not be reached for an interview, a Goodyear spokesman said. Mr. Hargreaves, who was born in Akron, joined Goodyear in 1971. He was named vice president and treasurer in 1987 after serving as finance director for Goodyear Great Britain. Mr. Hargreaves is a graduate of Harvard and Case Western Reserve universities.</p>
