        <p>If, for whatever cockeyed reason, you wanted to cast a classical musician alongside a professional athlete in a sneaker commercial, you might find a likely candidate or two. But you would find a host of unlikely ones, and among the very least plausible would be the pianist Rudolf Firkusny.</p>
        <p>Reserved and patrician in his bearing and in his playing, Mr. Firkusny, who lives in New York but was born in Napajedla, Moravia (now part of Czechoslovakia), in 1912, is the epitome of old-world grace and gentility. "I am not very much in the sport world," Mr. Firkusny said recently.</p>

        <p>If, for whatever cockeyed reason, you wanted to cast a classical musician alongside a professional athlete in a sneaker commercial, you might find a likely candidate or two. But you would find a host of unlikely ones, and among the very least plausible would be the pianist Rudolf Firkusny.</p>
        <p>Reserved and patrician in his bearing and in his playing, Mr. Firkusny, who lives in New York but was born in Napajedla, Moravia (now part of Czechoslovakia), in 1912, is the epitome of old-world grace and gentility. "I am not very much in the sport world," Mr. Firkusny said recently.</p>
        <p>Yet there he is on television with David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, playing Chopin and, uh, basketball in a commercial for Nike. The idea came from James Riswold, an admirer of Mr. Firkusny's piano-playing and a copywriter for the advertising agency Weiden &amp; Kennedy, based in Portland, Ore. Mr. Riswold's work in other Nike commercials has received wide acclaim.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Firkusny took part only in the final day of shooting, he said the process of repeated takes was exhausting, much as in a recording session. "For the first time I realized that it's not such an easy life to be a movie actor," he added. But there were rewards. He reported gleefully that he made one basket -- a feat, alas, not shown in the commercial.</p>
        <p>And now Mr. Firkusny revels in a new-found fame. "Everybody saw it somehow," he said. "My mailman told me he saw me on television. The druggist and my daughter's doctor saw it. That's the magic of television. I think it was good that for once serious music was put together with sports. Music needs all kinds of encouragement."  MUSIC</p>
