        <p>SOMETHING WAS AMISS, AND BILL ROBINSON knew it. Reviewing his collection of men's fashions for spring several months ago, the designer quickly put his finger on the problem. The shoulders of his sport coats were a little too, well, muscular.</p>
        <p>There was an easy fix, as Robinson saw it. He promptly relieved them of their one-inch pads, creating a jacket with shoulders that sagged as dramatically as they once had spread. Cut on the long side with knuckle-grazing sleeves, it is the "antithesis of Savile Row," says Robinson. "It looks almost like a hand-me-down."</p>

        <p>SOMETHING WAS AMISS, AND BILL ROBINSON knew it. Reviewing his collection of men's fashions for spring several months ago, the designer quickly put his finger on the problem. The shoulders of his sport coats were a little too, well, muscular.</p>
        <p>There was an easy fix, as Robinson saw it. He promptly relieved them of their one-inch pads, creating a jacket with shoulders that sagged as dramatically as they once had spread. Cut on the long side with knuckle-grazing sleeves, it is the "antithesis of Savile Row," says Robinson. "It looks almost like a hand-me-down."</p>
        <p>Alan Flusser, a leading interpreter of the Savile Row style for American taste, recently made a similar move, giving his ready-made suits broad but softened shoulders. They have become, he says, "less English, more hip."</p>
        <p>"Hip," natural-looking shoulders and an easier fit have come to imply sartorial independence and a certain patrician carelessness. Then again, they may signify nothing more than another swing of fashion's pendulum. The rise and fall of men's shoulders, after all, can be seen as the equivalent of women's soaring and dipping hemlines.</p>
        <p>A cursory look at the styles of the past several decades confirms the point. Natural-shoulder suits sold by Brooks Brothers, J. Press and other standard-bearers of American style in the 1950's were fine for many men, but unfortunately rendered others pear-shaped. Enter Pierre Cardin with a brawny solution. In the late 1960's, the French designer -- who had previously been known for making suits with high, small armholes -- reversed himself, introducing a model with squared athletic shoulders. The style caught fire. High on success, Cardin came up with later innovations that were as fleeting as they were provocative. These included the pagoda shoulder, which dipped from the collar to the shoulder's widest point, then peaked to soar like an eagle's wing.</p>
        <p>In the hands of Europeans like Cardin, Giorgio Armani and Claude Montana, shoulders were progressively pumped up until their outlines mimicked the inflated contours of America's best-known body builders. It was Armani who made the over-upholstered, Arnold Schwarzenegger torso seem antiquated. Midway through the 1980's, he introduced a jacket of zoot-suit proportions with shoulders that had had their stuffing knocked out. Meant to look like a cast-off from Dad's closet, it was designed for someone bold enough, rich enough or young enough to appreciate its deliberate imperfections.</p>
        <p>Or, conversely, old enough. As the baby boomers age, suggests Steve Barnett, a cultural anthropologist, they tend to give up the struggle to remain perpetually fit and streamlined. Barnett equates men's gradual acceptance of more natural-looking suits with "an admission of their changing bodies."</p>
        <p>Perhaps not a moment too soon. Deflated shoulders, as Barnett implies, may be one indication that the fortysomething generation is catching up with reality.</p>
