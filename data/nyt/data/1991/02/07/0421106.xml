        <p>Senior allied officers argued today that weeks of day-and-night bombing raids had significantly weakened Iraq's elite Republican Guards, but most said that more aerial attacks on the troops' positions would be needed before a ground offensive could begin.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the Pentagon operations chief, said in Washington that "there has been damage done" to the Guards, but declined to say how much. "We would like to see more damage" inflicted on the units, he added, "which is why we're continuing with the bombing campaign."</p>

        <p>Senior allied officers argued today that weeks of day-and-night bombing raids had significantly weakened Iraq's elite Republican Guards, but most said that more aerial attacks on the troops' positions would be needed before a ground offensive could begin.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the Pentagon operations chief, said in Washington that "there has been damage done" to the Guards, but declined to say how much. "We would like to see more damage" inflicted on the units, he added, "which is why we're continuing with the bombing campaign."</p>
        <p>With Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, scheduled to leave on Thursday on a fact-finding mission to Saudi Arabia, The New York Times reported from Washington today that Pentagon officials said the well-entrenched forces, which constitute President Saddam Hussein's main strategic reserve, have not yet been substantially weakened.  'Cut Their Effectiveness'</p>
        <p>A ranking American officer here, one of many officials who challenged the officials quoted in the Times article, commented: "We aren't ready for an offensive yet. That's what Cheney and Powell will hear this weekend. But our bombing attacks, especially the B-52's, have hurt the Guards physically and psychologically, cut their effectiveness a lot, and it's nonsense to suggest we haven't."</p>
        <p>In Washington, members of Congress were told in a briefing that the Guard divisions had been signficantly damaged by bombing raids and that 15 percent of all Iraqi ground weapons in Kuwait and southern Iraq had been destroyed.</p>
        <p>As the war reached the end of its third week, a flurry of air activity developed. British headquarters reported heavy surface-to-air missile and antiaircraft artillery fire over Iraq and Kuwait, with a volley of missiles fired at one Royal Air Force unit and another missile narrowly missing a Tornado fighter-bomber from a second unit and exploding a half-mile away.</p>
        <p>In addition, two United States Air Force F-15E Eagle fighter-bombers intercepted at least four Iraqi warplanes and shot down at least two of them over their home territory as they sought to flee to sanctuary in Iran, American officials said. It was the first such incident of the war.</p>
        <p>On the political front, the Baghdad Radio said Iraq was severing diplomatic relations with the United States and most of its allies, including Saudi Arabia, Britain and Egypt.  French Commander's Estimate</p>
        <p>American spokesmen here again declined to quantify the damage they say allied forces have caused thus far, but Gen. Michel Roquejoffre, the commander of French forces in the Persian Gulf, said that intensive air attacks had reduced the combat worthiness of the Republican Guards by about 30 percent. He cited deteriorating conditions in the Guards' supplies, morale, weapons, heavy equipment, communications and capacity to defend themselves from enemy air strikes.</p>
        <p>"This means we will have to wait a little longer," the general said at a briefing in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, "since we are not going to jump into the ground war until the forces offer so little resistance that we can attack in the best conditions from the point of view of allied losses."</p>
        <p>For the French, British, American and other coalition commanders here, the question is not whether ground warfare will be needed, but when. Several officers pointed again to late February as a likely target date for a land offensive that would probably also include airborne and amphibious forces.</p>
        <p>In the closed-door briefing in Washington, General Powell told lawmakers that the military effectiveness of one of Iraq's eight Republican Guard divisions had been reduced by 40 to 50 percent, an American Government official said. General Powell reportedly did not define exactly what he meant by military effectiveness.  Concentrated on One Division</p>
        <p>A Government official said that the unit referred to by General Powell is the Tawakalna division, a mechanized division that straddles the Kuwait-Iraqi border. The official said that American bombing raids have concentrated on this division -- one of the three heaviest Republican Guard divisions -- and that there is no indication that the combat effectiveness of the vast majority of Republican Guard forces has been severely damaged.</p>
        <p>The lawmakers were also told that more than 600 Iraqi tanks have been destroyed, according to an estimate by the Defense Intelligence Agency. Iraq has about 5,000 tanks in Kuwait and southern Iraq.</p>
        <p>In Riyadh, Brig. Gen. Richard I. Neal of the Marine Corps, an American spokesman, said two Soviet-built Sukhoi-25's close air support planes -- among Iraq's most advanced aircraft -- had been brought down, and two MIG-21 fighters -- also Soviet-built, but less up-to-date -- had probably been destroyed in the engagement in the skies over Iraq. A Saudi spokesman said, however, that four enemy planes had been shot down and that three others had escaped to Iran.</p>
        <p>The American tally, if correct, would bring the overall count in air-to-air fighting to 33 enemy planes lost, against zero for the allies.</p>
        <p>A pool report from an air base in central Saudi Arabia said two pilots of the Fourth Tactical Fighter Wing, flying combat air patrol east of Baghdad, spotted four Iraqi planes on their radar screens, 60 miles away. They closed quickly to within seven miles, the report said, rode in behind them and brought all four down with heat-seeking air-to-air missiles.  120 Iraqi Planes in Iran</p>
        <p>The pilots asked that for security reasons they be identified only by their radio call signs, as Vegas, a 30-year-old captain from King of Prussia, Pa., and Gigs, 26, a first lieutenant from Cincinnati. Gigs said he got the SU-25's -- "it was just the most spectacular thing I have ever seen" -- and his partner got the MIGs in the brief dogfight.</p>
        <p>General Neal also reported that a pair of carrier-based F-14 Tomcats had destroyed an Iraqi helicopter of an unspecified type over Kuwait. And he issued a revised figure for Iraqi planes taking refuge in Iran, indicating that 20 fled on Tuesday, not 10 as reported at the time, and that the total now stands at 120, not 110, including 95 fighter-bombers and 25 transports.</p>
        <p>Allied planes, briefers said, continued their attacks on bridges, supply columns, the Republican Guards, tanks, artillery and missile sites. The total number of missions flown approached 50,000 by this evening.</p>
        <p>Reports from Basra, the headquarters for the Iraqi occupation force in neighboring Kuwait, said waves of bombers had passed over every five minutes late Tuesday night and early this morning.</p>
        <p>The Baghdad Radio said 150 persons had been killed, including 35 children, in air attacks on the southern city of Nasiriya, near the ancient site of Ur on the Eurphrates River. A petroleum refinery and storage installation is situated there. Both General Neal and Group Capt. Niall Irving, the British briefing officer, denied any knowledge of bombing raids in the vicinity.</p>
        <p>Little Ground Activity</p>
        <p>There was little ground activity reported, except for the surrender to American forces of two groups of enemy soldiers. Six turned themselves in to the Marines, 11 to the Army. A total of 25 million leaflets urging surrender have been printed, said Col. Ahmed al-Robayan of the Saudi army, and 14 million have been dropped from the air.</p>
        <p>General Neal said that a clash between Syrian defenders and Iraqis who crossed the border on Sunday night had involved only Syrian artillery fire on the invaders, not the overrunning of a Syrian position, as reported in a dispatch filed on Tuesday by pool correspondents assigned to the Marines.</p>
        <p>A 17,000-member Marine amphibious force moved slowly north in the Persian Gulf, presumably heading toward a launching point for an invasion of Kuwait when word comes from Washington.</p>
        <p>Envirnomental officials said the immense oil slick, widely described as the largest in history, moved slowly south toward bird nesting grounds and water desalting plants. A leading Saudi expert, Dr. Abdul Aziz Abu Zenada, said cormorants, grebes, gulls and waders by the thousands were imperiled.</p>
        <p>American officials here and in Washington tried to head off speculation that a ground offensive was imminent and to suggest that a hard struggle may still lie ahead.</p>
        <p>Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d pledged to help rebuild Iraq after the war, but he said Saddam Hussein still had formidable strength and was in no sense a third-rate military power. He said that "tough times lie ahead" and that "the military actions now under way necessarily involve many casualties" for Iraqi civilians and allied troops.</p>
        <p>The Republican Guards -- about eight divisions, or 28 brigades, or 150,000 men -- were the subject of intense discussion at the daily briefings in Riyadh. Group Captain Irving said ceaseless allied raids, including repeated strikes by B-52 heavy bombers, mean that the Iraqi soldier "gets little sleep, day or night." Two Views of the Bombing</p>
        <p>There was apparent disagreement among allied spokesmen over what the raids were meant to achieve.</p>
        <p>Group Captain Irving said the purpose was "to lower morale" and to insure that the units were "in the poorest possible condition to fight effectively" when they finally were routed from their bunkers, "not to try to wipe out the Republican Guards." At no point did the British imagine, he said, "that air power would be able to break through the solid defenses that have been built up there."</p>
        <p>General Neal of the Marines said later: "We're dropping a lot of ordinance on the Republican Guards, not just to lower their morale, but also to destroy their tanks, their artillery, their logistical sustainment capability and their built-up areas."</p>
        <p>He added, "We're out there to destroy the Republican Guards."</p>
        <p>Both British and American officials said the Guards have used decoys to fool allied pilots, including plywood tanks coverered with foil so as to look real to radar and buckets of burning oil placed on perfectly serviceable tanks to make them seem to be on fire.</p>
