        <p>Bruce Beach, who resigned last month as executive vice president and managing director of Ogilvy &amp; Mather's Chicago office, has begun an arbitration proceeding against the agency and its parent company, the WPP Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beach charged in the demand for arbitration, which was released late yesterday, that Ogilvy and WPP "failed to comply" with the terms of a severance agreement they entered into in July 1989. Among other arguments, Mr. Beach contended that "an evolution of changes, often small at first but insidious and pervasive," combined to diminish his "autonomy and control" over the Chicago office.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman in the Chicago office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather said the agency had no comment.</p>
