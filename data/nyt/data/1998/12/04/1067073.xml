        <p>The Giants are training this week in low-key, cheerful Tucson, where the sun has seemed to soothe the team and soften the uneasiness of a 4-8 season.</p>
        <p>Rest and repose had been part of the plan all along, since this is not exactly a high-pressure week -- not when the Giants are preparing to meet the Arizona Cardinals. The Giants and the Cardinals, after all, have combined to win only 10 games this season.</p>
        <p>Who, then, would have expected a trash-talking war to erupt in this atmosphere?</p>
        <p>But today, as the Giants completed their practice and headed for lunch, they were told of comments in an Arizona newspaper by Cardinals defensive end Simeon Rice.</p>
        <p>''I've proven myself; nobody can block me in this league,'' said Rice, a third-year player who has yet to tackle a running back behind the line of scrimmage this season.</p>
        <p>In a 27-point loss to the Giants earlier this year, Rice had no solo tackles and one assist on a tackle. But of the Giants, he said: ''I don't feel like I have to show them anything. They know me. All they have to do is watch film to see how good I am.''</p>
        <p>Giants players were incredulous that Rice had been the one to speak up.</p>
        <p>''He should have to take a urine test after that comment,'' Michael Strahan, the Giants' defensive end said, ''because he's not watching the Simeon Rice I've watched on film. He should watch the film between him and the Cowboys' Larry Allen.</p>
        <p>''If you have to tell people you're good, you're just trying to convince yourself how good you are.''</p>
        <p>Left tackle Roman Oben, who will be principally assigned to block Rice, said: ''He really said that? Nobody can block him? If that's the way he feels, I'm not going to get into it. He's actually one of my better friends in the league. We made all the same all-American teams in college and got to know one another.''</p>
        <p>Oben paused, then added, ''Come on, did he really say that?''</p>
        <p>As if this episode was not bizarre enough, another commotion occurred after two people called a Phoenix all-sports radio station and identified themselves as friends of John Matsko, the Giants' offensive line coach who held the same position with the Cardinals in 1992-93.</p>
        <p>The callers, who gave only their first names, said Matsko told them that Rice was ''a coward.'' That enlivened the airwaves a bit. But it also left Matsko as dumbfounded as his players were about Rice's comments.</p>
        <p>''This is some kind of joke, right?'' Matsko said. ''How did I get in the middle of this? It's the farthest thing from true and I have no idea why somebody would do that. The Cardinals' organization knows that's not something I would say, and the players know it, too.''</p>
        <p>Rice is tied for 10th on the Cardinals in tackles and was especially dominated by the Giants in their 34-7 victory over Arizona in October.</p>
        <p>''Our whole group played well against them that day,'' Matsko said.</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel, meanwhile, seemed a bit amused by all the hubbub.</p>
        <p>''How do these things get started?'' he said. ''So much for our calm, pleasant week.''</p>
        <p>But even Fassel has not entirely escaped the rumblings. There have been suggestions that Fassel, Arizona's offensive coordinator in 1996, harbors some secrets for defeating the Cardinals. Fassel is 3-0 in two seasons against his former team.</p>
        <p>''I haven't played one down in the three games,'' he said, laughing. ''Somebody said I've got their team psyched out. I don't think that's the case.''</p>
        <p>But when Fassel was asked if it was true that he had some special insight on how to beat the Cardinals, and if so would he admit it, the coach said, ''No.''</p>
        <p>He smiled, then said, ''Maybe there is something there.''</p>
        <p>All this for a 4-8 team facing a 6-6 team.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Wide receiver IKE HILLIARD, who missed Wednesday's practice because he had a wisdom tooth extracted, returned to practice Thursday. . . . The Giants signed NATE MILLER, a 6-foot-3-inch, 310-pound tackle-guard who played 12 games last year for the Atlanta Falcons. He takes LONNIE PALELEI's spot on the roster. . . . The Giants' practices in Tucson have been a homecoming for LARRY MAC DUFF, the special-teams coach who was the defensive coordinator of the University of Arizona's Desert Storm defense in the early 1990's. . . . After Friday's practice, the Giants will settle into the area around Tempe, where Sunday's game will be played at Sun Devil Stadium.</p>
