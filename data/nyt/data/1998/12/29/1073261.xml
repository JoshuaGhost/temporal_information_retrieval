        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a physician involved in the education of medical students I was impressed with Dr. Abigail Zuger's Dec. 15 essay on the play ''Wit.'' Medical students are inundated with scientific information, but training in basic communication skills is often sorely overlooked. We are doing our best to begin to remedy this situation.</p>
        <p>At Mount Sinai Medical School, all students spend a month in their last year learning how to care for the growing population of elderly persons. Education in palliative care for patients of any age is an important part of this experience. Students are taught important skills in comfort care, pain management and important communication skills. Palliative care skills are reinforced at the Morchand Center, where they are observed interacting with actors posing as patients. The students practice breaking bad news by informing a patient she is H.I.V. positive or that breast cancer has spread to her bones. These interactions are videotaped and the students watch themselves interacting with patients. This educational experience for medical students is one small step in guiding young doctors towards empathy toward their patients.</p>
