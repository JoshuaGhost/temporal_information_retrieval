        <p>THIS week, five films that can legitimately be described as British will be showing in American theaters. Given the anxiety of holiday marketers, that number is in itself an eye-popper. What's more surprising, though, is that not one of these British films is about expendable laborers trying to salvage self-regard in a renovated upland city, or about young professionals contemplating themselves in the sleek surfaces of the new London.</p>
        <p>These films -- ''Elizabeth,''  ''Little Voice,''  ''Shakespeare in Love,''  ''The General'' and ''The Theory of Flight'' -- don't represent anything as grand as the renaissance of a national industry that looked so healthy in the 1960's and then again in the 1980's. The vagaries of multinational financing and staffing make such a notion a dated one anyway. But the films' variety -- from sly revisionism on the Elizabethan era to speculation about love and Lou Gehrig's disease -- is the sign of a heartening creative reawakening. The sort of Yank Anglophile who thinks back to classics like ''Room at the Top,''  ''Sunday, Bloody Sunday,'' and ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' more readily than to television's ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' should at least start paying closer attention to the new images of Britain that are sneaking now onto movie screens in the United States.</p>

        <p>THIS week, five films that can legitimately be described as British will be showing in American theaters. Given the anxiety of holiday marketers, that number is in itself an eye-popper. What's more surprising, though, is that not one of these British films is about expendable laborers trying to salvage self-regard in a renovated upland city, or about young professionals contemplating themselves in the sleek surfaces of the new London.</p>
        <p>These films -- ''Elizabeth,''  ''Little Voice,''  ''Shakespeare in Love,''  ''The General'' and ''The Theory of Flight'' -- don't represent anything as grand as the renaissance of a national industry that looked so healthy in the 1960's and then again in the 1980's. The vagaries of multinational financing and staffing make such a notion a dated one anyway. But the films' variety -- from sly revisionism on the Elizabethan era to speculation about love and Lou Gehrig's disease -- is the sign of a heartening creative reawakening. The sort of Yank Anglophile who thinks back to classics like ''Room at the Top,''  ''Sunday, Bloody Sunday,'' and ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' more readily than to television's ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' should at least start paying closer attention to the new images of Britain that are sneaking now onto movie screens in the United States.</p>
        <p>Early this year, the British cinematic presence here was less distinct, and less encouraging. ''Nil by Mouth,'' the actor Gary Oldman's grim depiction of his origins amid a working-class mire of violence and addiction, was an impressive directorial debut but almost willfully incoherent, in structure and dialogue. Mike Leigh's ''Career Girls'' had a razor-sharp poignance because Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman were so perfectly in form as newly mature women who meet again and reflect on their dissolute student days. That movie nevertheless felt like a minor chapter in Leigh's admirably idiosyncratic chronicling of contemporary, class-skewed England.</p>
        <p>More to the point, and more disturbingly, a film called ''Twenty-four Seven,'' the debut of a young director, Shane Meadows, found its way into American release. Set in decayed Nottingham, ''Twenty-four Seven'' starred Bob Hoskins as an alcoholic who tries to align his own recovery with that of a crew of unemployed miscreants by reopening a boxing club. Despite a searing performance by Hoskins, the film left the impression that it was simply a black-and-white, indie-hip exercise on a socio-cultural theme that had recently been more adeptly explored in ''Brassed Off''(out-of-work miners maintain their identity through a brass band), ''The Full Monty' (out-of-work steelworkers maintain their identity through bump-and-grind dancing) and, in its own way, ''Trainspotting'' (out-of-work young people maintain their identity through heroin).</p>
        <p>The implication was that the same amusing-but-painful, stiff-upper-lip movie was going to be made over and over again until all Britons were somehow integrated into the post-industrial economy. Then, in late spring, from across the genre spectrum, came ''Sliding Doors'' and ''Shooting Fish.''  For all their quirky angles and the charms of Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale, respectively, these films implied that the London romantic comedy was still following a course set four long years ago by ''Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' It was a relief when ''The Land Girls,'' an earnest, well-made drama about the home front during World War II, appeared in early summer. ''The Land Girls'' may have been predictable, but it was what the British predictably do best: evoking that part of the 20th century in which Britain was still arguably the center of the world.</p>
        <p>Earlier this fall, the best British film to open in United States theaters, ''Velvet Goldmine,'' was actually an American film, or, at least, was directed by an American, Todd Haynes. That film -- a scary fable about the glam-rock scene in the London of the early 70's, starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan McGregor, financed on both sides of the Atlantic -- represents a good argument for no longer even speaking of British film, or American film, or Irish film. These days, anyone who, through the good graces of Working Title or BBC Films or Miramax, can avoid the Hollywood maw and put together a distinctive piece of work occupies creative territory that is, practically speaking, just as special as a homeland. ''The General,'' which opened on Friday, presents the same argument: although it was directed by an eminent Englishman, John Boorman, the movie is, after all, about a notorious Irish gangster, Martin Cahill; it was filmed in Dublin, and it stars a red-hot Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson. And Boorman himself lives in Ireland.</p>
        <p>That said, ''The General'' does have the feel of a film made by a British director. Cahill's brutal story is told almost as that of an Everyman, with an odd but effective mix of intimacy and restraint; the details of Irish political life are present, certainly, but are rendered in a peripheral manner that would be unimaginable if the subject matter were in the hands of a romantic, of Irish directors like Neil Jordan or Jim Sheridan. ''The General'' is British in the sense that it is planted in a tradition that also includes memorable works like Karel Reisz's ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' (1960) and Tony Richardson's ''This Sporting Life'' (1963), which also center ambivalently on rogue heroes.</p>
        <p>The four other British films in American theaters now may not be as accomplished as ''The General,'' but they perhaps say even more about where one should search hopefully for a renewed British cinema. ''Little Voice,'' Mark Herman's adaptation of the play about an emotionally damaged young woman with a gift for imitating great singers, has some of the same overly melodramatic structure of his ''Brassed Off.'' Here, however, there is a range of darker, more intricate acting -- especially on the part of Jane Horrocks in the title role, Brenda Blethyn as her hysteric mother and Michael Caine as a never-has-been promoter -- that tempers Herman's sentimentalism, making for a more mature movie.</p>
        <p>As for approaches to Britain's past, it's possible to imagine a stock, pedantic screen account of the young Elizabeth I, but Shekhar Kapur's ''Elizabeth'' is surely not that. The Protestant-Catholic gamesmanship that surrounded her ascendancy is depicted in all its soul-staining terror, and Cate Blanchett, although she's as gorgeous as ever, leads the way in working against any notion that beauty and truth and goodness were the order of the day. As for ''Shakespeare in Love,'' no one will accuse John Madden of not venturing from the traditional approach to a British icon that he took to such fine effect last year in ''Mrs. Brown.''</p>
        <p>If there is still such a thing as British film, then one of the primary things going for it is a large pool of extraordinary actors -- if they can be persuaded to touch base between more lucrative Hollywood sojourns for long enough to make movies. In that regard, ''The Theory of Flight,'' which opens on Wednesday, is greatly encouraging.</p>
        <p>It's a small, eccentric film but boasts two big, talented stars, Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh, who clearly relish art as much as opportunity. As flawed as the film may be -- and the metaphor-heavy attempt by a troubled artist (Mr. Branagh) to build a flying machine gets a bit much -- Ms. Bonham Carter, who plays a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease, offers up ample revelatory moments. Her performance is a reminder that a British film is often the occasion for an acting accomplishment that's larger than the movie itself; Robert Carlyle's powerful presence in Michael Winterbottom's ''Go Now'' is another example from the last year.</p>
        <p>Flight imagery abounds in the current crop of British films -- in ''The General'' and ''Little Voice,'' pet homing pigeons carry the burden -- and in this context, the irony is obvious. British cinema has always had trouble keeping its best directors from flying the coop -- or, more accurately, has had trouble persuading them to persuade Hollywood that the coop's an interesting spot to revisit, as their Irish counterparts have managed to do with movies like ''The Boxer.'' One of Britain's best directors, Stephen Frears, had a movie open on Friday. It's called ''The Hi-Lo Country,'' and the title refers to New Mexico, not the Lake District.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best wish that one could make for British film is that Mr. Frears turn back to another film based on a Roddy Doyle novel, or that Mike Newell return home from ''Donnie Brasco'' and ''Pushing Tin,'' his forthcoming movie about American air-traffic control.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, who needs them? There's a lot to be said for simply looking forward to January and Ken Loach's ''My Name Is Joe.''</p>
