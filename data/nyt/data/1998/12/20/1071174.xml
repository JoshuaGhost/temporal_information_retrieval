        <p>Robert Sullivan wrote his acclaimed book ''The Meadowlands'' not as a New Jerseyan in defense of native soil but as a Jersey expatriate, living 2,500 miles away, in Portland, Ore. He wrote in the book, published earlier this year: ''I would walk into the woods outside of the city where I ended up living and see beautiful trees and huge mountains topped with spectacular glaciers that altogether only made me miss the world's greatest industrial swamp.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan recently spoke about  New Jersey from the perspective of the coast of Washington State, where he is observing a whale hunt by the Makah Indians for another book he is writing.</p>

He wrote in the book, published earlier this year: ''I would walk into the woods outside of the city where I ended up living and see beautiful trees and huge mountains topped with spectacular glaciers that altogether only made me miss the world's greatest industrial swamp.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan recently spoke about  New Jersey from the perspective of the coast of Washington State, where he is observing a whale hunt by the Makah Indians for another book he is writing.</p>
        <p>Q. Does it feel strange to be talking about the New Jersey Meadowlands from the Northwest?</p>
        <p>A. Actually, no. The Pacific Northwest has a lot more in common with New Jersey than many people think. I'm out here waiting for whales, and meanwhile a 51-foot dead whale recently washed up on the shores of Newark Bay. And Oregon, where I live, has kind of a symbiotic relationship with New Jersey. They were the first two states to do regional planning, and both states are very progressive in a lot of ways, doing many of the same things at the same time.  They both were the first states to have an environmental office.</p>
        <p>New Jersey and Oregon are also the only states in the country that prohibit self-service at gas stations.</p>
        <p>Q. What do Oregonians think about New Jersey?</p>
        <p>A. They're curious about it. When I do readings, I get a bigger crowd in Oregon and Seattle than in New Jersey. Everybody said that nobody would read the book outside New Jersey, but more people show up on West Coast. One of the first solo readings I gave in New Jersey was at the Princeton University Bookstore, and I actually never read because nobody showed up. This was also the first reading that my mother attended. Eventually one person came in, and we all got excited that he was there for the reading, but he asked, ''Is this the sheet music department?'' So We decided to go down the street for ice cream and coffee.</p>
        <p>Q. Why are people in the Northwest interested in the Meadowlands?</p>
        <p>A. I think it appeals to people's sense of adventure. When I do readings, I usually read the part about how I went canoeing in the Hackensack River, and people are fascinated by that. And then I'd have to explain to them that I spent many years growing up in northern New Jersey, which is prettier than parts of Oregon.</p>
        <p>Q. Why did you go canoeing in the Hackensack River?</p>
        <p>A. Partly because the Meadowlands are a hard area to research, logistically. It's very difficult to travel around there, because much of it is not covered by roads, and there is terrible traffic over the roads that are there. I had a very small window of time to drive around without running into a huge amount of traffic. I spoke to one man who had tickets to see the Three Tenors at the Meadowlands sports complex and lived three miles from there, but because of the time of day it took him 45 minutes to get there, and he was late. But of course that's nothing new for people who live there and drive every day.</p>
        <p>But the real reason I did it is for the adventure and exploration. Exploring is really doing something that nobody else would do, and that includes things like going canoeing in the swamps of the New Jersey Meadowlands. Most people would never dream of doing that, and they're fascinated that I did it and wrote a book about it.</p>
