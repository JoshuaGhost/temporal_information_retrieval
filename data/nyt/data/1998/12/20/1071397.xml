        <p>South Korean scientists said they had cloned a human cell from an infertile woman, creating an embryo that theoretically could have grown into an identical replica of the woman. But because of the legal and ethical implications of their work, they said, they stopped the experiment and did not try to create a human clone. The research has already caused controversy. Korean groups are calling for a ban on such experiments.</p>
