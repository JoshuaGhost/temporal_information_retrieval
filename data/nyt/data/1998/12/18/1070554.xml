        <p>The British Arts Council announced today that it would increase its subsidy to the struggling Royal Opera House by more than $21 million over the next three years, a move the opera said would allow it to reinstate a portion of its canceled 1999 season and to charge less for tickets when it returns to its refurbished headquarters next December.</p>
        <p>The Royal Opera, which also presents ballet and other works, will use the money for 10 performances of ''Paul Bunyan'' at the Sadler's Wells Theater in April. It will also put on a short series of concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in May and June, and hold a concert at the Barbican with Placido Domingo on April 25. Meanwhile, the Royal Ballet will perform a four-week summer season at Sadler's Wells in July and will embark on its planned trip to Asia in the spring.</p>

        <p>The British Arts Council announced today that it would increase its subsidy to the struggling Royal Opera House by more than $21 million over the next three years, a move the opera said would allow it to reinstate a portion of its canceled 1999 season and to charge less for tickets when it returns to its refurbished headquarters next December.</p>
        <p>The Royal Opera, which also presents ballet and other works, will use the money for 10 performances of ''Paul Bunyan'' at the Sadler's Wells Theater in April. It will also put on a short series of concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in May and June, and hold a concert at the Barbican with Placido Domingo on April 25. Meanwhile, the Royal Ballet will perform a four-week summer season at Sadler's Wells in July and will embark on its planned trip to Asia in the spring.</p>
        <p>Today's news of the increased funds also spurred Bernard Haitink, music director of the Royal Opera, to withdraw his threat to resign. Several months ago, Mr. Haitink said that he could not remain in the job if the cash-starved opera went ahead with plans to cancel the 1999 season. But today, he said, ''I am pleased to remain music director of the Royal Opera House and look forward to opening what will be a wonderful new theater.''</p>
        <p>In increasing the grant to $26.4 million from $23.8 million for the 1999 season -- and promising a further increase, to $33 million, in each of the next two years -- the Arts Council, the Government-financed agency that dispenses money to cultural organizations, was expressing its view that after years of mismanagement and financial ineptitude, the opera house had finally begun to put itself in order.</p>
        <p>Even as it undergoes a $353 million refurbishment of its home in Covent Garden, scheduled to be completed at the end of 1999, the opera house has been running its day-to-day operations at a deficit for years. After a series of musical-chair changes in top management, it finally arrived at a plan this fall to restore its financial health. But the plan was extreme, involving the cancellation of the entire 1999 opera season, layoffs and salary cuts for many staff members.</p>
        <p>''The Arts Council believes the Royal Opera House is now putting itself back on track for a sustainable future to insure a solid base for world-class opera and ballet after considerable management and financial problems in the past,'' the agency said in a news release. But, it added, the extra money came with strings attached.</p>
        <p>Among other things, it said, the opera house promised to lower the price of opera tickets, which can cost as much as $218 each for the most expensive seats at the most expensive operas. It also promised to increase access by staying open during  the day and attracting visitors with new shops and restaurants, to enhance its exposure with educational programs and television broadcasts and to raise $165 million in private donations. ''All of the grant figures are in anticipation of, and conditional upon, a satisfactory, detailed business plan based on an artistic program of quality and a genuine concern for access and education,'' the Arts Council said.</p>
