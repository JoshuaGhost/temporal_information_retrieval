        <p>With the brief distant fury of battle passed, the American troops at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia gathered in the early morning hours today for a post-Desert Fox pre-Christmas celebration, anticipating praise from the Defense Secretary and music by Carole King, Mary Chapin Carpenter and David Ball.</p>
        <p>Only there was no concert, no raucous U.S.O. roadshow to cheer the troops as they prepared to spend yet another holiday in the desert, trying to keep down President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.</p>
        <p>At the last minute the American Embassy pulled the plug, fearing that a show could offend the sensibilities of the Saudi hosts during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen still managed to rouse lusty cheers when he reannounced the Pentagon plan to increase military pay and pensions. And Ms. King sang a version of ''You've Got a Friend'' a cappella.</p>
        <p>But it was hard to hide the disappointment.</p>
        <p>''It seems a shame to bring all this equipment all this way and not play,'' a member of the traveling party grumbled as Mr. Cohen and the United Services Organization entourage boarded a C-17 jet bound for its next stop on a whirlwind holiday tour with the troops.</p>
        <p>If there was ever a paradox that captured the complexities of the American military presence in the Persian Gulf, it is that the United States could continue bombing after the dawn-to-dusk fasts of Ramadan began on Friday night but it felt uncomfortable allowing a rock-and-roll Christmas concert to thank the troops in Saudi Arabia, one of its closest allies.</p>
        <p>''It would be like bringing the circus to Jerusalem during Yom Kippur,'' a Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said in explaining the unease that Saudi rulers feel not only toward perceived insensitivity to Ramadan, but also to overt displays of Christianity, like Christmas trees.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has portrayed the four nights of strikes against Iraq as a success that has badly weakened Mr. Hussein's military. But the attack, by far the largest campaign that President Clinton has ordered, has done little to change the prospect that American forces will have to remain in Saudi Arabia and in other gulf outposts for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>In fact, with the strikes' sounding the apparent end to the United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq, the United States will have to rely more than ever on the threat of force to check Mr. Hussein, even as the ambivalence about the American presence deepens.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we should have fixed permanent bases out here,''  said Gen. Anthony C. Zinni of the Marines, commander of American forces in the region, who led the Iraq strikes. ''I think that sends the wrong message. Our presence here is temporary.''</p>
        <p>But then he added, ''I think for a long time we'll have forces here.''</p>
        <p>With each passing year the amenities for the troops improve. The 4,000 Americans at Prince Sultan are slowly moving from tents to permanent housing put up by the Saudis. All the bases now have American fast-food restaurants, cable television and E-mail.</p>
        <p>Airman Chiffon Goss, 18, who oversees the local workers in the mess hall at Prince Sultan, said she first heard that the air and missile strikes had begun Thursday morning, Saudi time, when an E-mail arrived from her mother, who was watching CNN in Texas.</p>
        <p>In the holiday season many bend the strict prohibitions that the Saudis impose. Deep in the communications tent a furtive four-foot Christmas tree twinkled on a table. ''We try our best,'' Staff Sgt. Ricardo Aponte said.</p>
        <p>But the rolling waves of deployments, in which one squadron or brigade or ship replaces another over and over, have strained morale, training and readiness. Many troops interviewed here were on their second, third or fourth tours since the gulf war ended in 1991. General Zinni said the record was 10.</p>
        <p>For most of the troops the attack on Iraq proved a short-lived, though eminently satisfying, distraction from the day-to-day routine of launching aircraft to patrol the ''no flight'' zone that was established over southern Iraq in 1992.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't your everyday get-up-and-launch-the-planes-for-no-reason kind of day,'' Chief Petty Officer Russ Celia, 37, of Whidbey Island, Wash., said in an interview today aboard his ship, the carrier Enterprise. He is, he said, on his fourth gulf tour.</p>
        <p>The Enterprise, the first nuclear carrier, played a large role in the attack, with her F-18's, F-14's and EA-6B's conducting about half the 250 American and British missions.</p>
        <p>Comdr. Michael Shoemaker, an F-18 pilot who flew into Iraq each of the four nights, said he did not believe at first that the planes were actually going into battle, recalling the last-minute order last month to abort an attack. ''I kept thinking they'd call it off,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Commander Shoemaker, 38, who has flown for the Navy for 16 years but never before in combat, said the attacks by his squadron, the Gunslingers, had been successful, despite antiaircraft fire that intensified as they neared Baghdad. But he said it would take time to assess the long-term damage.</p>
        <p>''We spool it up each time Saddam acts up,'' he said. ''Most of the guys around here say enough is enough.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Cohen, General Zinni and the U.S.O. the spirit of the tour picked up considerably aboard the Enterprise -- ''four and a half acres of sovereign U.S. territory,'' the Navy likes to say -- and even more so tonight at a visit to Army and Marine troops at Camp Doha, near the Kuwaiti capital.</p>
        <p>The Enterprise is leaving the gulf, as soon as Thursday evening, replaced by the Carl Vinson, which arrived in time to participate in the fourth day of strikes.</p>
        <p>The concert, finally unbound, included the improbable scenes of the Defense Secretary's ''doing the locomotion'' and Ms. King's leading the battle-tested crew assembled on the Enterprise's deck in a sing-along of one of her best-known songs, ''(You Make Me Feel Like)  a Natural Woman.''</p>
