        <p>The Rangers' defensive woes of the previous two games disappeared last night after three days of hard practices and a number of lineup changes. But there was no solution for a lethargic offensive effort in a game that they let slip away.</p>
        <p>The Rangers rarely threatened until the final minutes in falling quietly to the Carolina Hurricanes by 1-0 at Madison Square Garden. It was the Rangers' fifth loss in their last six games, but perhaps the most painful.</p>
        <p>This game was one the Rangers had pointed to as essential. They start a four-game road trip after the two-day Christmas break. But the improved effort was not enough to make the difference.</p>
        <p>''It's totally the wrong way you want to go into any kind of holidays, in this kind of mood,'' Ulf Samuelsson said. ''We've been pumping ourselves up so much for this game. It meant so much, and it sort of knocks the wind out of you. It's hard.''</p>
        <p>The holiday might represent the Rangers' best chance to put this behind them. Coach John Muckler had put the team through long skates after two consecutive embarrassing performances last week.</p>
        <p>''I think you don't have a choice,'' goalie Mike Richter said. ''You have to put it behind you and go on. We didn't dwell on the last two, and they were worse efforts.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers surrendered 13 goals in their previous two games, a 6-3 loss at New Jersey and a 7-4 defeat at Toronto. Richter, who had been playing sensationally before this recent struggle, was in the net last night for his 12th straight game, and from the start this one was far different from the previous two.</p>
        <p>Richter made four spectacular saves in the opening period, almost singlehandedly squashing Carolina opportunities. In the second period, he continued to excel, and the Rangers held an 18-16 advantage in shots through the first 40 minutes. But in the third period, it took just 38 seconds for the shutout to be lost.</p>
        <p>Carolina right wing Ray Sheppard settled the puck along the boards outside the right circle and, with a clear look at the net, drilled a shot over Richter's right shoulder into the top of the net on the near side.</p>
        <p>''You want to win, but it's not just a snap of the fingers that's going to pull you out of a slump,'' Muckler said. ''There's a lot of things that go through everybody's mind on your way to getting out. The only way you're going to get out of a slump is hard work.''</p>
        <p>A scoreless tie through two periods may have been the last thing either side expected after the Rangers' recent troubles. And the Hurricanes had problems of their own. They took the ice with a shortage of defensive help, playing without Steve Chiasson (back spasms), Sean Hill (bruised ankle), Nolan Pratt (back spasms), and Dave Karpa (knee surgery on Dec. 2). Curtis Leschyshyn played despite a bruised sternum.</p>
        <p>But the Carolina defense was hardly tested, and in the second period, when the Hurricanes went on a power play, they played with five forwards on the ice.</p>
        <p>The Rangers, who had converted 8 of their last 16 power-play opportunities entering last night, had two chances in the first period but could not take advantage. When Carolina's Marek Malik was whistled for interference at 9 minutes 29 seconds of the first period, the Hurricanes nearly scored.</p>
        <p>First, Paul Ranheim made a run up the right side after the puck skipped past Brian Leetch as he attempted to settle it with his glove just outside the Hurricanes' zone, but Richter was able to stop the shot. Then Keith Primeau skated past Petr Nedved for an open shot at Richter from directly in front of the net. But Richter again make the stop.</p>
        <p>Just 47 seconds after the Hurricanes defended that power play, Carolina's Kent Manderville was sent off for boarding the Rangers' Marc Savard. This time the Rangers had their chances, with Mathieu Schneider blasting a shot from just inside the blue line that goalie Arturs Irbe caught with his glove. Then, with six seconds left in the man advantage, Niklas Sundstrom deflected a Nedved slap shot in front, but Irbe again smothered the puck.</p>
        <p>''Our power play has been a good reason that our offense has scored goals'' Leetch said. ''At some point, you need to get some five-on-five conversions and tonight we got neither. It's a game that we really had to win, wanted to win.''</p>
