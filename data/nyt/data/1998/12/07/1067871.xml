        <p>Years ago, when his media empire consisted of little more than an Atlanta television station, Ted Turner was so widely considered a self-promoting parvenu that critics called him the Mouth of the South. So when Mr. Turner, now vice chairman of Time Warner Inc., announced late last year that he planned to donate $1 billion to the United Nations over the next decade, many wondered if the philanthropic gesture would turn out to be all talk.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Turner's own calculus, the contribution was to come in annual gifts of $100 million for 10 years. And as 1998 nears its end, he concedes that his contribution so far -- $75 million in the form of roughly a million shares of Time Warner stock -- has fallen a bit short of the target. But he said in a telephone interview last week that setting up the money pipeline had taken longer than expected, and that now that it was in place, he planned to increase the flow rate and make up the difference by the end of next year.</p>

        <p>Years ago, when his media empire consisted of little more than an Atlanta television station, Ted Turner was so widely considered a self-promoting parvenu that critics called him the Mouth of the South. So when Mr. Turner, now vice chairman of Time Warner Inc., announced late last year that he planned to donate $1 billion to the United Nations over the next decade, many wondered if the philanthropic gesture would turn out to be all talk.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Turner's own calculus, the contribution was to come in annual gifts of $100 million for 10 years. And as 1998 nears its end, he concedes that his contribution so far -- $75 million in the form of roughly a million shares of Time Warner stock -- has fallen a bit short of the target. But he said in a telephone interview last week that setting up the money pipeline had taken longer than expected, and that now that it was in place, he planned to increase the flow rate and make up the difference by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the United Nations is not complaining, having already committed $55 million from Mr. Turner's largess to projects that include fighting polio around the world and helping to keep H.I.V.-infected pregnant women from transmitting the AIDS virus to their unborn children.</p>
        <p>''We announced our first round of grants in May and the second in September,'' said Jennifer Lee DeLaurentis, head of the United Nations office overseeing the gifts. ''We are very pleased with the volume and quality of projects approved thus far.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, 60, has become increasingly active as a philanthropist in recent years. ''Everybody gives,'' he said, ''except Rupert and Sumner.'' He was referring, half in jest, to two titans of the media industry, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, and Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redstone declined to comment. A Murdoch family spokesman said the Murdochs regularly donated to all sorts of charities.</p>
        <p>The Turner United Nations gifts are administered by the United Nations Foundation, which Mr. Turner set up after announcing his plan in September 1997.</p>
        <p>Taylor Glover, Mr. Turner's financial adviser, said that it had been fairly complicated to start giving away the money. Not only did Mr. Turner have to set up the new foundation, but the United Nations itself created an entity, the United Nations International Partnership Trust Fund, to receive the gifts. The two foundations were not in place until last February.</p>
        <p>David Harwood, chief of staff of the United Nations Foundation, said that he, like Mr. Turner, expected the rate of giving to accelerate in the coming year. And Mr. Glover noted that Mr. Turner had already placed an additional 1.6 million shares of Time Warner stock, worth roughly $100 million, into a charitable remainder trust, which can be used as needed in coming years to meet the foundation's United Nations obligation. Meanwhile, Mr. Turner can receive income from the trust.</p>
        <p>Already, both the foundation and the trust fund have sold their Time Warner shares to lock in gains in the stock's price, which has risen 67.8 percent this year.</p>
        <p>By the same token, since Mr. Turner announced his intention to give to the United Nations, his ability to do so has sharply increased. In September 1997, his 58 million shares of Time Warner stock were trading at $55.375 each, giving him a net worth of $3.2 billion. Although he now has 54 million shares, their value is about $5.72 billion. The stock closed Friday at $106.06</p>
        <p>The United Nations Foundation remains separate from the Turner Foundation, which is based in Atlanta and run by Mr. Turner; his wife, Jane Fonda, and Mr. Turner's five children. That foundation gave away $26 million this year. Mr. Turner also gave Ms. Fonda $10 million to establish a foundation of her own.</p>
