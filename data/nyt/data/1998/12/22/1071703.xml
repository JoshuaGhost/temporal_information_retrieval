        <p>In the fullest military assessment since the bombing of Iraq ended, the American commander who led four days of strikes said today that American and British forces hit 85 percent of their targets and badly damaged the Republican Guard.</p>
        <p>Although there were no signs of an uprising against President Saddam Hussein, as some planners had hoped, the commander, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni of the Marine Corps, said the strikes had weakened the Government, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>He noted Iraq's decision on the eve of the strikes, which began last Wednesday, to divide the country into four military zones. He said such a step appeared aimed as much at quashing internal dissent as defending the country from American and British missile and air strikes.</p>
        <p>''If I were to make a judgment, I would say that was for internal control,'' General Zinni said. ''And I would point to that one very open and obvious move on his part as maybe an indication he lacks confidence in his own ability to continue to ruthlessly rule.''</p>
        <p>After he spoke, the Pentagon issued its most detailed assessment of the damage. Although the first, incomplete, assessments showed modest success, today's data showed that 43 of 100 targets had been severely damaged or destroyed, while 30 had received moderate damage.</p>
        <p>Still, 12 targets suffered only light damage, and at least 13 suffered none at all. Most of these were surface-to-air missile batteries, which are easily moved. General Zinni said the analysts who categorize the severity of the damage are of necessity conservative in their estimates.</p>
        <p>He also said targets that appeared only slightly damaged can in fact suffer greatly. As an example he showed an aerial photograph of the headquarters of Mr. Hussein's Baath Party. It had holes punched in its roof but was otherwise still standing.</p>
        <p>''One of our analysts would say this is moderate or light damage,'' he said. ''But I guarantee you, nobody is working this morning in Baath Party headquarters.''</p>
        <p>That has not diminished Iraq's invective. Ever since the raids stopped, Mr. Hussein's deputies have responded with defiance, declaring both military and moral victory and vowing never to resume cooperation with United Nations inspections.</p>
        <p>Today the Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, said the attacks had had very little effect on Iraq's military, killing only 62 military ''martyrs'' and only 38 in the Republican Guard.</p>
        <p>General Zinni did not dispute Iraq's assertions on casualties. ''We are not in the business of body counting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He did confirm that the Republican Guard had abandoned its barracks and headquarters before the strikes began, presumably because the United Nations weapons inspectors withdrew.</p>
        <p>General Zinni said the attacks focused on the bases and equipment of four Republican Guard divisions and caused significant damage. He also emphasized the impact of the destruction of barracks and headquarters -- ''pretty tough,'' he said, ''if you're a troop in the field and you've got no place to go home to at night.''</p>
        <p>Still, the campaign underscored the limits of air and missile strikes -- even of one that proved the largest against Iraq since the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has said the strikes accomplished the objective of ''degrading'' Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbors and to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, without losing any American or British troops.</p>
        <p>General Zinni said he did not know how Iraq could look on the events as ''a victory in any way,'' adding, ''I think our friends in the region and others clearly look at what happened to Iraq and realize that Saddam suffered a defeat.''</p>
        <p>But the attack has ended the involvement of the team that the Administration considered the best monitor of Iraq's military activities: the United Nations inspectors. And Mr. Hussein is as defiant as ever.</p>
        <p>Finally, the attack has come at a steep cost. The United States spent $2 billion last year on its forces in the  gulf; this attack will add hundreds of millions. General Zinni said it was too early to estimate the cost, but each of the 400 or so cruise missiles the United States used costs an average of $1 million.</p>
