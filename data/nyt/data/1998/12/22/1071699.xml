        <p>Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seem to be goading each other into a major new round of fighting, with the people of Kosovo and Western countries able to do little more than watch.</p>
        <p>Military and police units have been on the move in the last few days. Long convoys, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, are leaving bases where the Government had promised that their forces would remain and are putting men in new positions or taking territory from the rebels.</p>
        <p>The rebels, who moved into many areas vacated by the Serbs in October, are stepping up the recruiting and training of fighters and are obtaining large amounts of military gear, according to diplomats. In the last week eight Serbs have been slain. Serbs are convinced that the rebels are responsible, and many are threatening to take their revenge against ethnic Albanian civilians.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley C. Clark, and senior American diplomats went to Belgrade today to tell top Yugoslav officials to rein in their forces.</p>
        <p>But many Western diplomats in Yugoslavia say they doubt that they can stop renewed combat on a large scale, even though it had been believed that the harsh Balkan winter would prevent any new conflict. The chief Western diplomat in Kosovo, William Walker, an American, is more optimistic than others. Still, he said there was not much the West could do except try to persuade the rebels and the Government to act peacefully.</p>
        <p>''I hope no one is overestimating the tools at our disposal,'' Mr. Walker said. ''We don't have many.''</p>
        <p>In a month or so, as many as 2,000 international observers are scheduled to be on the ground in Kosovo, monitoring each side and trying to ease tensions. Now, however, there is a question whether war will erupt before most monitors are in place.</p>
        <p>A senior Western diplomat, referring to the rebel-run Kosovo Liberation Army, said: ''The Government's decided enough is enough; the K.L.A. is out of control. If the Government responds the way it seems to be getting ready to do, then the monitors will have to get out because there'll be war everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Today in this village, six tanks were involved in combat with rebel forces that recently moved into the area. The tanks left their base over the weekend for what the Government called a training exercise. New rebel trenches have been set up on the hills around the fighting.</p>
        <p>The fighting here, along with the appearance today of heavily armed Serbian paramilitary policemen on the roads nearby, comes after a police official was shot to death as he walked to work this morning in a neighboring town.</p>
        <p>None of this was supposed to happen after President Slobodan Milosevic, under threat of NATO air strikes, agreed to stop offensive operations and withdraw many of his forces from Kosovo in October. Diplomats, led by Americans, thought that if the Government halted their  attacks, the rebels would honor a cease-fire, allowing negotiations.</p>
        <p>But negotiations have made little progress. Most ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's population, want independence. The Government is offering limited autonomy, and ethnic Albanian political leaders are deeply divided over what level of autonomy would be acceptable. Rebel leaders generally feel that they can win independence through war.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, when the body of the Deputy Mayor of Kosovo Polje, a Serb, was found by the roadside shot to death, Miroslav Mijailovic, one of the 1,000 or so residents of the village of Velika Hoca, was welcoming guests to his home. The Serbian family was giving its annual homage to its patron, St. Nicholas.</p>
        <p>Dishes of potatoes, sweet peppers, cabbage rolls, fish and cookies nearly overflowed the long table as people tried to find solace in talk of religion and tradition. But it did not work, because they said they could feel Kosovo sliding quickly into war.</p>
        <p>''The people are not to blame for what is coming, not the Serb people or the Albanian,'' Mr. Mijailovic said. ''Everyone wants what we had before, peace. But there are leaders on both sides who are setting a fire.''</p>
        <p>Historically, Serbs and ethnic Albanians have been very close in the area of western Kosovo near Velika Hoca. But now, the guests said, they are terrified by rebel fighters they see on the hills around the village.</p>
        <p>The two peoples were so close that one guest, the Serbian Mayor of the city of Orahovac, three miles away, said one of his best friends was the man who is now the rebel commander for the area.</p>
        <p>''When he started his chicken farm, he came to me for the money to buy the first load of chicken feed,'' said the Mayor, Andjelko Kolasinac.</p>
        <p>''We are at the limits of our patience,'' Mr. Kolasinac said. ''The West must put enough pressure on the K.L.A. that they stop what they are doing. Otherwise what I see coming will not be stopped.''</p>
        <p>When the Government has taken action against the rebels in the past, it has usually been so brutal that it has only increased the conviction among ethnic Albanians that they must create their own country.</p>
        <p>A large military offensive over the summer forced as many as 300,000 ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. Government forces then looted and burned an estimated 20,000 houses. It was the prospect of mass starvation and deaths caused by exposure in the Balkan winter that prompted Western countries to intercede so that refugees could feel safe enough to move back to their villages.</p>
        <p>But even now, in response to the rebel actions, Government forces often brutalize ethnic Albanians.</p>
        <p>After the funerals last Wednesday of six young Serbs shot in a coffee shop in the city of Pec, the police went on a rampage for several days, arresting and severely beating dozens of ethnic Albanian men.</p>
        <p>Many victims said they had not even been questioned about the killings, only beaten.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Government forces retook a nearby village, causing hundreds of ethnic Albanian civilians to flee the area.</p>
        <p>As his children packed clothes, blankets and bags of flour and a red kerosene lantern into a wagon behind the family tractor in the village, called Glodanje, Nysret Maloku echoed the appeal Serbs are making to Western countries. ''You must stop these attacks on us,'' he said. ''We want peace, but we want to survive.''</p>
        <p>And just as Serbs are insisting that Government forces be unleashed against the rebels, Mr. Maloku said he wanted the Kosovo Liberation Army to strike back at the Government.</p>
        <p>''They have to protect us from the regime,'' he said. ''Any army is supposed to protect its people.''</p>
