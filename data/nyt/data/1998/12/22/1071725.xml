        <p>Editorial says next Israeli Government must be able to move consistently toward peace; says Ehud Barak, Labor party leader, and Gen Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, independent centrist, are obvious candidates to lead such a Government, but that Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu could also succeed if he can break free of the uncompromising right (M)</p>

        <p>The campaign to choose Israel's next government began yesterday, more than a year ahead of schedule. That will mean regrettable new delays in peace talks with the Palestinians. But the elections, to be held sometime early next year, will give Israeli voters a chance to reinforce the wobbly Middle East peace effort.</p>
        <p>The fractious right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the past two and a half years has shown itself incapable of consistent movement toward peace. A new, more broadly based government could prove more productive. Mr. Netanyahu's two main opponents, Ehud Barak, the Labor party leader, or Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, an independent centrist, are obvious candidates to lead such a government. But Mr. Netanyahu, if he can find a way to free himself from the uncompromising right, could also do the job.</p>

        <p>The campaign to choose Israel's next government began yesterday, more than a year ahead of schedule. That will mean regrettable new delays in peace talks with the Palestinians. But the elections, to be held sometime early next year, will give Israeli voters a chance to reinforce the wobbly Middle East peace effort.</p>
        <p>The fractious right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the past two and a half years has shown itself incapable of consistent movement toward peace. A new, more broadly based government could prove more productive. Mr. Netanyahu's two main opponents, Ehud Barak, the Labor party leader, or Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, an independent centrist, are obvious candidates to lead such a government. But Mr. Netanyahu, if he can find a way to free himself from the uncompromising right, could also do the job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue and deserves credit for leading his Likud party away from rejection of all territorial compromise. But most of his term has been consumed by narrow tactical maneuvers, and he has yet to articulate a clear vision of what would constitute a fair and acceptable peace. Regrettably, he has launched his re-election campaign with a threat to suspend his part in carrying out the American-brokered Wye accord he signed in October.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak is an untested campaigner who will have to overcome voter suspicions that his Labor party is too eager for agreement with the Palestinians and not careful enough on security issues. General Lipkin-Shahak, a former army Chief of Staff, has no political experience and, since he is still formally a military officer, has refrained from publicly expressing his views. But many centrists see him as the best hope for achieving a secure peace.</p>
        <p>Labor and Likud have both been losing voters, and these elections are likely to go to the candidate who can sway the large group of independents who want a negotiated peace but also want Palestinian leaders to control terrorism. Israel would be well served if these supporters of a fair peace prevail at the polls and shape the next government.</p>
