        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the increasing use of video surveillance yesterday, saying that residents have been clamoring for more security cameras to watch out for crime in public spaces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was responding to a study released over the weekend by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which found that at least 2,397 surveillance cameras were trained on public streets, sidewalks, buildings and parks in Manhattan. The study recommended that the city regulate the use of surveillance cameras to make sure they do not unnecessarily violate people's privacy.</p>
        <p>But the Mayor said the city was careful not to use video surveillance too liberally. Of the 2,397 surveillance cameras counted in the study, only about 400 were operated by government agencies. The rest were operated by private organizations.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that we use cameras very modestly,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday when asked about the study at a news conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also said that video surveillance had become an effective and popular crime-fighting tool in public housing projects, where the city began installing cameras last year. Only 3 of the city's 342 housing developments have surveillance cameras so far, said Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the city's Housing Authority. But the Police Department is planning to install cameras at 6 more developments next year as part of a pilot project, he said.</p>
        <p>Installing surveillance cameras in housing projects extends to some of the city's poorest residents a security measure enjoyed by residents of luxury apartment buildings, Mr. Giuliani said. He said the city had surveyed residents of housing projects and found that 85 percent were in favor of video surveillance.</p>
        <p>Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said his group did not want to abolish video surveillance, but rather to encourage public discussion of it. The city should limit how long material recorded by surveillance cameras could be kept before it is destroyed, he said. It should also limit access to material recorded by surveillance cameras, and require that signs be posted near all such cameras to warn people that they are being watched, Mr. Siegel said.</p>
