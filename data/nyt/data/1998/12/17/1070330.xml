        <p>In its third acquisition to be announced this week, the Quintiles Transnational Corporation, the nation's largest provider of clinical drug trials, said yesterday that it would buy the Envoy Corporation for $1.7 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>Quintiles, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has made several acquisitions this year to broaden its range of pharmaceutical services. Aside from conducting clinical trials, the company has become a leading industry provider of sales support and marketing information.</p>
        <p>By acquiring Envoy, a health-claims processing company in Nashville, Quintiles will be able to expand its marketing base for prescription drugs. Envoy is expected to process 1.2 billion claims this year from doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>''This purchase gives us a lot of information,'' said Dennis Gillings, the chief executive of Quintiles.</p>
        <p>''We don't compete now with I.M.S. Health,'' a company that measures pharmaceutical sales trends, he added. ''But this purchase will enable us to deliver more real-time data than they do currently.''</p>
        <p>Analysts considered the deal fairly priced. Quintiles will exchange 1.166 of its shares for each Envoy share, valuing Envoy stock at $65.51 a share, a 55 percent premium based on Tuesday's closing prices.</p>
        <p>The deal may be terminated, though, if shares of Quintiles trade beyond a range of $40 to $71.50.</p>
        <p>Investor reaction was mixed. Shares of Envoy rose 18.9 percent, or $8, to $50.25. The Quintiles shares fell 18.4 percent, or $10.3125, to $45.875. The selloff in the stock surprised Mr. Gillings and some analysts.</p>
        <p>''Investors may have walked because that was Quintiles's third deal in a week,'' said Kenneth Miller, a senior analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist. ''They believe the company has bitten off more than it can chew. People may also assume that the deal means there is a problem in the company's core business.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Quintiles said it would acquire a drug-development center in Missouri from Hoechst A.G. for $93 million in cash. On Tuesday, the company said it would buy Pharmaceutical Marketing Services, including its Scott-Levin drug-marketing unit, for $197 million in stock.</p>
        <p>Analysts and investors were also concerned that Quintiles might not meet earnings projections for next year -- $1.37 to $1.40 a share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Though company executives said yesterday that earnings would meet expectations, analysts had thought the company would surpass them.</p>
        <p>''Some investors may not have known what to make of this deal,'' Mr. Gillings said. ''In one sense, it may have looked like Envoy and Quintiles didn't know much about each other. That may have forced these people to spend the day scratching their heads trying to figure it out.''</p>
        <p>While the Quintiles expansion plan is aggressive -- the company has made more than a dozen acquisitions this year -- analysts have generally applauded it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gillings has moved into contract sales -- renting the services of Quintiles salespeople to sell products for other companies -- and marketing information, a crucial commodity as more drug companies advertise directly to consumers.</p>
