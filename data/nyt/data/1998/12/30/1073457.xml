        <p>Buoying the hope that the Catskills may someday be transformed from their Borscht Belt past into a gambling destination of the future, a key Federal agency has endorsed an Indian tribe's plan to operate a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway.</p>
        <p>In a memo dated Dec. 9, Brenda L. Bennett, acting director of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs' eastern office wrote that the proposal tendered by the St. Regis Mohawks of northern New York State ''satisfies all requirements'' and ''will positively impact the tribe and the surrounding community'' by creating 3,000 new jobs.</p>

        <p>Buoying the hope that the Catskills may someday be transformed from their Borscht Belt past into a gambling destination of the future, a key Federal agency has endorsed an Indian tribe's plan to operate a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway.</p>
        <p>In a memo dated Dec. 9, Brenda L. Bennett, acting director of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs' eastern office wrote that the proposal tendered by the St. Regis Mohawks of northern New York State ''satisfies all requirements'' and ''will positively impact the tribe and the surrounding community'' by creating 3,000 new jobs.</p>
        <p>The memo estimated that the casino would result in ''4.4 million day trips to the area, inducing spending outside the proposed casino of $337 million.'' In so doing, the memo concludes, the casino ''will revitalize the area's tourism industry and provide the impetus for additional tourist-related developments.''</p>
        <p>The plan still must be approved by the Bureau's headquarters in Washington. Then it must be approved by Gov. George E. Pataki, who to this point has not disclosed his leanings.  ''The Governor recognizes that gambling might be a valuable option for resort areas like the Catskills,'' said Charles H. Deister, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki. ''But we're going to have to wait and see what the Federal decision is.''</p>
        <p>Even so, people who have followed the proposal closely over the last few years interpret the memo as an important, if not ultimate, hurdle to pass.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a crucial step because the central office very seldom overrules the area office,'' said Philip H. Tarbell, former legislative chairman of the Mohawk Nation, who helped to draft the original casino plan. ''The region will benefit, the economy will benefit and the tribe will benefit.''</p>
        <p>Neither the Washington office nor the eastern office, in Arlington, Va., returned several calls seeking comment on the agency's endorsement, which was reported yesterday in The Daily News.</p>
        <p>As it stands, the plan calls for the construction of a 700,000-square-foot casino and convention center at Monticello Raceway, under a partnership between the Mohawks and three New York developers -- Watermark Investments, America Towers Partners and Alpha Hospitality.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other tribes that offer gambling, the Mohawks are planning to operate a casino far from their home territory, several hundred miles to the north. The Monticello casino would be built on land placed in a trust, and not subject to taxes. The tribe would share its revenues with various local governments.</p>
        <p>Supporters say the proposal would provide a boost to the Mohawks, who have an unemployment rate of 30 percent with a fifth of households earning less than $10,000 a year.</p>
        <p>In Sullivan County, the casino figures to rejuvenate a region that once drew capacity crowds for its nightly feasts of live entertainment and food, but now evokes mostly memories.</p>
