        <p>The Devils were playful after practice today, laughing and joking as they finished up and boarded the team bus back to Washington to await their game with the Capitals on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>They had good reason, having beaten the Buffalo Sabres and Dominik Hasek, 7-4, in convincing fashion on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The Devils not only removed a bit of the aura of invincibility surrounding Hasek, but they also pushed ahead of the Sabres once again in the Eastern Conference standings.</p>
        <p>But there were few smiles present immediately after the game on Monday. It took a day for the memory to fade of how the Devils had allowed a five-goal lead in that game to be cut to a two-goal advantage, how mistake after mistake revealed flaws in their performance and the realization that they had not played all that well even in building a 6-1 lead.</p>
        <p>And it took a day for Coach Robbie Ftorek to be sure the message had got through to the team that it still needed fine-tuning, despite picking up a victory.</p>
        <p>''It's something that we talk about, why and how to prevent that and why we have to prevent that in the future,'' Ftorek said after the Devils ended practice at the Piney Orchard Ice Arena. ''That's all a learning, teaching type process, explaining and the whole thing. Yes, it's been brought up, but I don't think it will be brought up again.''</p>
        <p>Ftorek may have reinforced the message today, but it was hardly necessary. The Devils knew that a rare dismal performance by Hasek had masked some deficiencies on Monday. They scored on each of their first three shots and four of six shots before Hasek was removed only 22 seconds into the second period with the Devils in front, 4-1. With the lead at 6-1 entering the final period, the Devils relaxed, committing mental and physical errors.</p>
        <p>The final score did not reflect the fact that the Devils were outshot by 40-18. The Sabres were able to mount two breakaways that Martin Brodeur stopped before a breakaway with the Devils on a power play resulted in the Sabres' third goal. Buffalo then closed the gap to 6-4 with 6 minutes 30 seconds remaining before the Devils finally stiffened, adding an empty-net goal in the final seconds.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Devils were hardly celebrating their status as dominators of Hasek or as the conference's leading team.</p>
        <p>''I knew that they wouldn't be,'' Ftorek said. ''They knew that I wouldn't be. We all knew that we weren't happy. We were happy that we got the 2 points. We weren't happy with the way we played the game. We still won the game. That's the important thing.''</p>
        <p>Even if the third period put a damper on the emotions that night, the Devils did come out of the game with some positives, including the performance of the rookie center Brendan Morrison, who had a goal and two assists in the first period while playing on the fourth line with Krzysztof Oliwa and Sasha Lakovic.</p>
        <p>But Morrison said he still must maintain more consistency.</p>
        <p>''I've just got to keep plugging away,'' Morrison said after the game. ''Hopefully, this will lead to better things. I know I can do a good job on the ice.''</p>
        <p>Ftorek added: ''Things clicked well for him early. That was the important thing. Then it just snowballed from there.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Although SCOTT NIEDERMAYER remained home Tuesday with his wife, who is pregnant and was not feeling well on Monday, ROBBIE FTOREK said he expected him to be back for the Capitals game. But BOBBY CARPENTER, who did not practice after suffering another setback when his bruised foot was hit by the puck in the morning skate on Monday, and RANDY McKAY, who remained home with the flu, will probably not play. . . . Ftorek had SASHA LAKOVIC skating with PETR SYKORA and JASON ARNOTT, with PATRICK ELIAS joining BRENDAN MORRISON and KRZYSZTOF OLIWA, but he said that it did not mean that he would line the players up that way on Wednesday.</p>
