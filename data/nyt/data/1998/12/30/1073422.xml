      <abstract>
        <p>Seeds of a biracial politics are seen in rural white South; even in most rural and impoverished districts, significant number of white Southerners are seen able to overcome race as an absolute obstacle to voting for a black politician who shares their thinking, votes their interests and hauls home plenty of pork; example cited in rural Colquitt County, Georgia, where Repr Sanford D Bishop Jr, moderate black Democrat, won re-election convincingly in rural, conservative district where nearly two-thirds of voters are white; map shows demographics of Georgia's Second Congressional District; photo of Bishop (L)</p>

        <p>Ten years ago, Wayne Williams, a peanut farmer here, would no more have considered voting for a black man for Congress than he would have planted his crop in the chill of December.</p>
        <p>Louie Perry Jr., down in Colquitt County, felt pretty much the same way. So did J. L. Tillman and, truth be told, most every other white farmer who tills the clay of southwest Georgia. But in last month's election, Mr. Williams, Mr. Perry, Mr. Tillman and tens of thousands of others voted enthusiastically for Representative Sanford D.

        <p>Ten years ago, Wayne Williams, a peanut farmer here, would no more have considered voting for a black man for Congress than he would have planted his crop in the chill of December.</p>
        <p>Louie Perry Jr., down in Colquitt County, felt pretty much the same way. So did J. L. Tillman and, truth be told, most every other white farmer who tills the clay of southwest Georgia. But in last month's election, Mr. Williams, Mr. Perry, Mr. Tillman and tens of thousands of others voted enthusiastically for Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., a moderate black Democrat who won re-election convincingly in a rural, conservative district where nearly two-thirds of the voters are white.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop won almost 4 out of every 10 white votes in the Second District of Georgia, an achievement that would have been inconceivable a few years ago. By comparison, David N. Dinkins won just a fourth of the white vote in 1989, when he was elected the first black mayor of New York City.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Bishop's white supporters acknowledge they had to overcome deep prejudices to vote for him. ''I just wouldn't have thought a black man would know enough to do the job,'' Mr. Williams explained. Other white farmers referred to the Congressman matter-of-factly with the coarsest of racial epithets before explaining what it was they liked so much about him.</p>
        <p>That may seem a perverse compliment. But whatever whites want to call Mr. Bishop, their willingness to vote for him may signify one of the most hopeful developments in Southern politics in decades. Many black politicians have managed to attract white support in urban, New South areas like Atlanta. But Mr. Bishop's  electoral success suggests that even in the most rural and impoverished districts, a significant number of white Southerners can overcome race as an absolute obstacle to voting for a black politician who shares their thinking, votes their interests and hauls home plenty of pork.</p>
        <p>For years, the unwillingness of such whites to vote for blacks has been the cornerstone of redistricting policies intended to maximize minority representation. As legislatures prepare to reconstitute Congress after the 2000 census, the opponents of such redistricting view Mr. Bishop as the most compelling evidence that black candidates can win in white districts. Conversely, those who support race-based redistricting attribute Mr. Bishop's success to his incumbency, which was gained in a majority black district before the Supreme Court ordered a remapping in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop's story does not mean that racism is dead in southwest Georgia. Nor does it mean that there are no longer deep racial disparities in the rural South in income, housing, education and health care. But it does suggest, some three decades after the culmination of the civil rights movement, that the racial bitterness born of forced desegregation has started to fade, and that old prejudices are giving way to a more pragmatic politics of racial cooperation and interdependence.</p>
        <p>''There's no revolution that's occurred down here,'' said Thomas C. Chatmon Jr., the son of a black civil rights pioneer who has been selected by the power structure in Albany, the largest city in the Second District, to direct a downtown redevelopment effort. ''It doesn't show that whites or blacks are willing to be colorblind. But what it does show is that southwest Georgians are willing to cohabitate, are willing to work together, that they know that there must be compromise on both sides in order to move together on our collective agenda. That's the reality. And absolutely that is progress.''</p>
        <p>Race Gives Way To Self-Interest</p>
        <p>It is hard not to see a measure of progress here in the gradual subjugation of race by the more natural politics of self-interest. During Mr. Bishop's three terms in Congress, large numbers of white south Georgians have concluded that his accessibility and his influence -- particularly with other black Democrats in the House -- far outweigh any consideration of race.</p>
        <p>''To start with I wasn't wild about him, because he was black,'' explained Mr. Williams, 55, a lanky third-generation farmer who grows peanuts and tobacco on 84 acres here. ''So many black people around here, you just can't count on them. But he went around and made some talks and we liked the way he talked. I've met him twice and he talks to you, not above your head. If you have a problem, he'll help you out with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop has earned the fealty of white constituents through his aggressive advocacy for Federal farm programs, balanced budgets, welfare reform, school prayer and gun ownership. To suit his district, he has switched positions on issues like the assault weapons ban, which he first supported and later opposed. He advertises himself as a conservative, and reinforced that claim by becoming the only black member of the right-leaning Democratic caucus known as the Blue Dogs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop has also put his white constituents at ease with an affable, nonthreatening manner and a determined resistance to playing the firebrand on racial issues. He has protected military bases, secured financing for road widenings and historical sites, and become a regular at local events like the Big Pig Jig in Vienna and the Rattlesnake Roundup in Whigham. He has even joined the National Rifle Association and taken up bird hunting, although his farmer friends report that the doves are never safer than when Mr. Bishop is walking the brush.</p>
        <p>Like many of his constituents, James Lee Adams Jr., a prominent white farmer in Camilla, said that Mr. Bishop made a lasting impression by using his seat on the Agriculture Committee to persuade black Democrats and urban Northerners to preserve Federal price supports for peanuts in 1996.</p>
        <p>''It's questionable whether it would have survived without the votes he brought to it,'' said Mr. Adams, who is chairman of the agency that administers Federal farm programs in Georgia. He added: ''I think most of us have gotten beyond the white and black issue. We prefer to focus on the green.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tillman, 70, who farms cotton and peanuts just south of Moultrie, also cited the peanut program in explaining his support for Mr. Bishop. ''Now when he came in, he didn't know a thing about peanuts, probably thought they grew on trees,'' Mr. Tillman said. ''But he's educated himself.''</p>
        <p>How did Mr. Tillman feel about voting for a black man? ''A nigger?'' he asked, finishing the question. ''I couldn't have seen doing it before, wouldn't even have thought about it. But I think he's done a lot for farmers, more than any of them up there in a long time.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Perry recalled getting a telephone call two years ago from a friend who urged him to support Mr. Bishop's Republican opponent. ''He said, 'What would your Daddy say if he knew you were voting for a black person?' '' Mr. Perry said. ''I said, 'Well, he would think I was pretty smart if he knew the man was helping us.' ''</p>
        <p>That is precisely the message that Mr. Bishop, 51, has promoted in campaigns.</p>
        <p>''There were people who never would have imagined voting for me, who didn't vote for me the first time,'' he said. ''But the majority vote their pocketbooks. They understand the precarious situation that the farming community is in and they'll support people that help them.'' He added, ''That was actually the key element of Dr. King's dream, that blacks could be known by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.''</p>
        <p>An Unlikely Landscape For a Proving Ground</p>
        <p>Nine blacks were elected to Congress from majority white districts this year, including several, like Representatives Cynthia A. McKinney of suburban Atlanta and Melvin L. Watt of Charlotte, N.C., who won with notable white support. But none won in a more unlikely place than the Second District of Georgia. Only 36 percent of the district's registered voters are black. The largest city, Albany, has but 78,000 residents. While the 31-county district remains marginally Democratic, whites now support Republicans regularly.</p>
        <p>The landscape here is a patchwork of pecan groves, cotton and peanut fields and quail-hunting plantations interspersed with small towns built around courthouse squares and cotton gins. This time of year, with the cotton crop just in, white tufts litter the roadsides. Blue harvesters churn through the pecan groves, sucking fallen nuts off the ground and spewing out a mulch of twigs and leaves.</p>
        <p>Much of this land was first cleared and planted by slaves, and the phrase ''plantation mentality'' still resonates with many blacks. It was in Albany, where asphalt turned to dirt when white neighborhoods turned to black, that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. encountered some of the staunchest resistance to the civil rights movement. And while south Georgia now has black police chiefs and county commissioners,  time has not eased all tensions.</p>
        <p>In Albany, for instance, whites and blacks have feuded over whether to rename Jefferson Street for Dr. King. A black-majority City Commission approved the change in 1996. Two months after the signs went up, a newly elected white-majority commission ordered them down.</p>
        <p>And yet there are signs of increasing sensitivity. A new civil rights museum in Albany opened in November with biracial backing. A number of the city's civic leaders have started to meet regularly to discuss racial issues, with one group calling itself White Men Coming to Terms With Our Own Racism.</p>
        <p>But churches and country clubs remain largely segregated, and whites tend to move out of neighborhoods that become more than 20 percent black, said Michael D. Rogers, a business professor at Albany State University who leads the city's Coalition for Diversity. And blacks in the Second District, the poorest district in the state, are nearly twice as likely as whites to have dropped out of school, more than three times as likely to live in poverty and more than 10 times as likely to live in homes without adequate plumbing, census figures show.</p>
        <p>A Firm Foundation In Civil Rights</p>
        <p>On paper, Mr. Bishop might not seem a natural fit with the farmers of southwest Georgia. He was reared in Mobile, Ala., the son of a black college president who demanded that his students register to vote. At age 10, he defied a Mobile bus driver by sitting in the whites-only section of an otherwise empty bus.</p>
        <p>At Morehouse College in Atlanta, Mr. Bishop became an admirer of Dr. King, the college's most famous graduate. He marched in a downtown civil rights demonstration, served as student-body president in 1968, the year that Dr. King was assassinated, and sang with the Morehouse glee club at his funeral. After graduating from Emory Law School, he joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in New York City, and later accepted N.A.A.C.P. help in establishing a civil rights law firm in Columbus, Ga.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop served in Georgia's General Assembly from 1977 to 1992, the year he first ran for Congress. The state Legislature, encouraged by the Bush Administration to create majority black districts, had designed a Second District where the voting-age population was 52 percent black. Mr. Bishop defeated a vulnerable white incumbent in the Democratic primary, and then cruised to victory in the general election. He  won re-election easily in 1994.</p>
        <p>But by 1996 new lines had been drawn by Federal judges after the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to use race as a dominant factor in redistricting. By redrawing the lines to eliminate concentrations of blacks in Macon and Columbus, where Mr. Bishop lived, the judges reduced the district's black voting-age population to 35 percent.</p>
        <p>Redistricting: A Test Both For and Against</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop moved to Albany and won anyway, with 54 percent of the vote and an estimated 36 percent of  the white vote. This year, against a capable and adequately financed Republican opponent, Joe McCormick, he polled even better, winning 57 percent of the total vote, an estimated 38 percent of the white vote and 98 percent of the black vote, according to an analysis by Charles S. Bullock 3d, a University of Georgia political scientist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop did not, however, do as well with white voters as some white Democratic candidates. For example, in the 12 Colquitt County precincts where at least 90 percent of the registered voters were white, Governor-elect Roy E. Barnes won 53 percent of the vote and Mr. Bishop won 41 percent.</p>
        <p>Still, A. Lee Parks Jr., the Atlanta lawyer who successfully challenged the racial foundation of Georgia's redistricting plan, said Mr. Bishop proved that blacks could be elected to Congress ''without racially biased districts.''</p>
        <p>''Sanford actually represents people without regard to race, and when he does that people forget his race,'' Mr. Parks said.</p>
        <p>Many black politicians, he said, alienate white voters by ''communicating that they prefer their black constituents, that their priority is serving their black constituents. Often that's what polarizes elections on racial lines.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of race-based redistricting counter that voting remained racially polarized in Mr. Bishop's last two elections. And they emphasize that a crucial advantage for candidates like Mr. Bishop was that he was first elected in a majority black district and then took the benefits of incumbency to his new white district.</p>
        <p>''I'm not ready to conclude that we are suddenly a race-blind electorate,'' said Laughlin McDonald, director of the Southern office of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Adams, the farmer from Moultrie, put it a different way.</p>
        <p>''We haven't arrived yet,'' he said. ''I don't know if you ever arrive, if you ever wipe every vestige from your mind. But what's most important sometimes is what direction you're going.''</p>
