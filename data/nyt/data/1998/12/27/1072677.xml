        <p>IN an advertisement now running for ''Fosse: A Celebration in Dance,'' the ballet and modern dancer Desmond Richardson stands in profile, his hands on his hips, a bowler perched at a raffish angle on his head. One leg is straight and the other bent. He wears ballet slippers. Sheathed only in tights and a vest, his remarkably muscular body looks sculptured. In the show (now in previews at the Broadhurst Theater, where it opens Jan. 14), he assumes this pose in ''Mr. Bojangles,'' a tender tribute to dancers past their prime.</p>
        <p>Most of the production's 30 numbers, culled from Robert Fosse's prodigious choreographic output and featuring excerpts from ''Pajama Game'' and ''All That Jazz,'' require a hard-edged sensuality. Rising to the occasion in six pieces, Mr. Richardson lets go his full intensity in a solo, ''Percussion 4,'' and in ''Cool Hand Luke'' he gyrates in vintage Fosse style, looking as experienced as the rest of the 35-member cast, all seasoned show dancers. After opening in Toronto in July, ''Fosse,'' directed by Richard Malby Jr. with assistance from the singer-dancer greats Ann Reinking and Gwen Verdon, had limited engagements in Boston and Los Angeles. Reviews have been favorable.</p>

        <p>IN an advertisement now running for ''Fosse: A Celebration in Dance,'' the ballet and modern dancer Desmond Richardson stands in profile, his hands on his hips, a bowler perched at a raffish angle on his head. One leg is straight and the other bent. He wears ballet slippers. Sheathed only in tights and a vest, his remarkably muscular body looks sculptured. In the show (now in previews at the Broadhurst Theater, where it opens Jan. 14), he assumes this pose in ''Mr. Bojangles,'' a tender tribute to dancers past their prime.</p>
        <p>Most of the production's 30 numbers, culled from Robert Fosse's prodigious choreographic output and featuring excerpts from ''Pajama Game'' and ''All That Jazz,'' require a hard-edged sensuality. Rising to the occasion in six pieces, Mr. Richardson lets go his full intensity in a solo, ''Percussion 4,'' and in ''Cool Hand Luke'' he gyrates in vintage Fosse style, looking as experienced as the rest of the 35-member cast, all seasoned show dancers. After opening in Toronto in July, ''Fosse,'' directed by Richard Malby Jr. with assistance from the singer-dancer greats Ann Reinking and Gwen Verdon, had limited engagements in Boston and Los Angeles. Reviews have been favorable.</p>
        <p>The question is how did a classically trained dancer become an emblem of such a quintessentially Broadway style in his first  Broadway appearance? ''Audiences are stunned by Desmond,'' said Ms. Verdon. ''He's totally different from any performer I've ever seen. Besides his amazing musicality, he moves like a panther.'' In fact, Fosse's moves felt natural to Mr. Richardson. ''Jazz is in my body,'' he said. ''I was a street dancer before I was anything else.''</p>
        <p>In the last few years, several superb male dancers have come to the fore in classical and modern dance, among them Vladimir Malakhov and Jose Manuel Carreno at American Ballet Theater, Matthew Rushing at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Albert Evans at New York City Ballet. But, even in such impressive company, Mr. Richardson's technique and expressiveness stand out. ''When we danced together in Nacho Duato's 'Remanso' at A.B.T.,'' said Mr. Malakhov, ''Desmond made everything look so easy. I wished I could be like him.''</p>
        <p>At 30, Mr. Richardson has already been a principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Frankfurt Ballet and American Ballet Theater. Moreover, his talent has attracted choreographers as diverse as George Faison, Ulysses Dove, Garth Fagan, John Butler, William Forsythe and Lar Lubovitch. ''Instinctively, Desmond conveys poetry in movement,'' said Mr. Lubovitch, who choreographed the lead in Ballet Theater's ''Othello'' for him.  ''Then there's his superb technique. As a dance linguist, he speaks eloquently in all styles. Nothing he performs is flat or uninflected.'' Mr. Faison went further: ''He is the most magnificent dancer America has produced in years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson blossomed early. As a child, he started dancing at home, in  Queens. ''My family likes to party,'' he said. ''They're from the South and the Caribbean. Everybody dances in my house -- salsa, reggae, soul. We watch to see who can do the newest step. My mother acts as catalyst. She knows how to bring the party up. When we dance, the feeling comes from inside. No pretense. No facade. It infiltrates you.''</p>
        <p>But until he discovered ''Great Performances'' on Channel 13, Mr. Richardson didn't have any concept of professional dance. ''Then I fell in love with every aspect of dance -- the theater, the music, the costumes, the sets,'' he said. ''They became a part of me.'' Since his parents couldn't afford dance classes, he auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. He won a place as a freshman and within a year had a scholarship to continue his studies at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. In 1986, Ailey asked him to join his company.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, Mr. Richardson maintained a professional life outside established dance. In 1988, Michael Jackson asked him to be in his video ''Bad'' and since then he has performed in other videos and toured with En Vogue, Aretha Franklin, Prince and Madonna. In 1994, he established his own modern troupe, Complexions, with the choreographer Dwight Rhoden, in order to support and explore new dance movement. ''I fill myself up with as many things as possible,'' he explained. ''I like works that are completely out of the ordinary. Alvin  taught me the importance of versatility. He said: 'If you can sing, you have to sing; if you can act, act. You'll bring all that to the stage, and it's so very relevant.' ''</p>
        <p>So far, no one company has given Mr. Richardson a chance to exhibit the full extent of his abilities. ''Such an incredible talent should be catered to,'' said Keith Lee, who choreographed for Mr. Richardson at the Ailey company. ''Desmond shouldn't have to go all over the place to find interesting opportunities. An artistic director should bring them to him. Bob Joffrey did that at the Joffrey Ballet for his principal dancers and so did Lucia Chase at A.B.T.''</p>
        <p>After seven years with the Ailey company, he left for the Frankfurt Ballet to try something new. He joined Ballet Theater in 1997, largely because Mr. Lubovitch wanted him for the lead in his full-evening work ''Othello,'' a co-production of Ballet Theater and the San Francisco Ballet. He expected Ballet Theater to offer him other opportunities. However, his only other role of significance was in ''Remanso.'' ''When I went there,'' he said, ''many people with the company seemed surprised that I had been trained in ballet. It's so ridiculous. I'd like to think my color didn't have anything to do with my not being asked to play big classical roles. But given my technical abilities, I don't know what to think.''</p>
        <p>One role that Mr. Richardson wanted badly was Romeo in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' a role that has not been danced in the full-length version by an African-American in a major company in this country. Although Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of Ballet Theater, considers Mr. Richardson a great dancer, he did not think he was ready for Romeo. Instead, he was given Tybalt in that ballet and had the mimed role of Carabosse, the evil fairy, in ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' He also appeared with Ballet Theater in Jerome Robbins's ''Fancy Free'' and as the partner of the Russian ballerina Nina Ananiashvili in Clark Tippet's ''Some Assembly Required,'' both modern ballets based in the classical vocabulary.</p>
        <p>Rudolf Nureyev traveled constantly to find places to exercise his talents. Consequently, he appeared with numerous ballet and modern dance companies over the course of his lengthy career, even doing a stint in the Broadway show ''The King and I.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson's pace and his need for variety aren't unlike Nureyev's. Take, for example, the last 13 months: His marathon began in November 1997 when he joined Ballet Theater for its season at City Center in New York. Meanwhile, he had heard about ''Fosse'' from his friend Elizabeth Parkinson, a former Joffrey dancer who was already in the show. In December, he auditioned for Chet Walker, a co-choreographer with Ms. Reinking of ''Fosse,'' and was signed on.</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. Richardson went to Toronto to start workshops for ''Fosse.'' Two months later, he took a leave to dance ''Othello,'' with the San Francisco Ballet. In early June, he returned to New York to appear in ''Othello'' with Ballet Theater at the  Metropolitan Opera House. A couple of weeks later found him in a SoHo loft performing Mr. Rhoden's works with Complexions.</p>
        <p>The tempo didn't let up. By July, he was back in Toronto with ''Fosse.'' (Given his importance to the show, the producers had only regretfully agreed to his missing the last week in Toronto and the first week in Boston.) In August, he hopped on a plane for Milan, Italy, where Mr. Forsythe, artistic director of the Frankfurt Ballet, choreographed a piece for him to perform at La Scala with Alessandra Ferri, a principal dancer with Ballet Theater. His only break from the production  since then was in October when Complexions performed at the Hostos  Center for Arts and Culture in the Bronx. Between engagements, he kept up with acting and voice lessons, for in the future he hopes to do films.</p>
        <p>In spite of his unforgiving schedule, Mr. Richardson thrives on varied assignments. The choreography of ''Fosse'' demands from him special attention to detail. From Mr. Forsythe, he grew to understand improvisational technique. ''Billy made me see how I make decisions,'' he said, ''and how and where movements originate in my body and mind.'' In Europe, he also discovered that artists use their skills quiet differently from the way they do in the United States. ''There, a performance is all about the work,'' he said. ''It's not about the performers. The dancers invite you into what they're doing; it's not in your face. Unfortunately, here everything has to be pow! Right now!</p>
        <p>''Technique should only be an accouterment,'' he added. ''A dancer must breathe life into every gesture. Then, his spirit and individuality color it. It's what I work for. It's what I do in 'Fosse.' ''</p>
