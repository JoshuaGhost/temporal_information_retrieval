        <p>The Fete des Vignerons, a major wine festival, will be held in Vevey, Switzerland, next summer from July 29 through Aug. 15. The event has taken place only four or five times each century since 1783; the last was in 1977.</p>
        <p>More than 450,000 visitors are expected at the celebration in Vevey, a town of 70,000 near the eastern end of Lake Geneva. The festival is being organized by the Confrerie des Vignerons, a trade guild formed in the 17th century to promote the wine industry in Lavaux and Chablais, two wine regions that stretch along Lake Geneva from Lausanne east to the Rhone River. In preparation for the festival the guild will build a 16,000-seat arena in Vevey's Market Square that looks across the lake to the snowcapped French Alps.</p>

        <p>The Fete des Vignerons, a major wine festival, will be held in Vevey, Switzerland, next summer from July 29 through Aug. 15. The event has taken place only four or five times each century since 1783; the last was in 1977.</p>
        <p>More than 450,000 visitors are expected at the celebration in Vevey, a town of 70,000 near the eastern end of Lake Geneva. The festival is being organized by the Confrerie des Vignerons, a trade guild formed in the 17th century to promote the wine industry in Lavaux and Chablais, two wine regions that stretch along Lake Geneva from Lausanne east to the Rhone River. In preparation for the festival the guild will build a 16,000-seat arena in Vevey's Market Square that looks across the lake to the snowcapped French Alps.</p>
        <p>The main event will be a performance in which more than 4,600 actors, singers and artists -- mostly townspeople -- present the myths, folklore and modern aspects of winemaking. An original score will be played live by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and by the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne.</p>
        <p>Following each of the seven daytime performances (Aug. 4, 5, 9 to 12 and 15) and seven evening performances (July 30 and 31 and Aug. 2, 5 to 7, and 13), a town fair with theatrical vignettes, music, food and dancing will take place throughout Vevey.</p>
        <p>Tickets for the pageant run from $48 to $190, and the town fair is free. Tickets for the pageant's two dress rehearsals cost $26 to $62.50.</p>
        <p>The festival will also feature parades through Vevey's Old Town (July 29 and Aug. 1, 8, 14) and a show on July 29 at which the region's best vintners are crowned.</p>
        <p>Parade tickets are $11 to $26; children under 14 are free. Admission to the July 29 show is $37 to $110.</p>
