        <p>''There's gray smoke -- actually it's gray tilting toward white,'' Gov. George Pataki quipped during a break in negotiations over New York State's charter school legislation. Likening his backroom talks with legislative leaders to the secretive manner used by the College of Cardinals to select a new pope was distressingly apt. The Governor pushed through legislation empowering nonprofit groups to open taxpayer-financed charter schools without any hearings or the debate it deserved. New York will now join more than 30 states with charter school statutes, and Mr. Pataki will have a policy that appeals to conservatives should he choose to run in G.O.P. Presidential primaries in 2000.</p>
        <p>In return for the Legislature's hasty approval of the charter school measure yesterday, the Governor will sign a bill giving legislators a 38 percent pay raise, their first since 1989. Salaries of the Governor, his cabinet and most judges will also rise.</p>
        <p>The school measure embraced by the Governor, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, authorizes the creation of up to 100 charter schools. As many as 50 of those charters would be issued by the State University of New York and the rest would be awarded by the State Board of Regents. There is no cap on the number of public schools that could convert into charter schools. But such conversions would require the approval of the Regents, parents and the local school board. That lever would give superintendents like New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who strongly opposes the plan, a role in shaping some charter schools.</p>
        <p>The Governor and Mr. Silver each made a major concession. Mr. Pataki dropped his call for a  charter school commission and recognized the oversight responsibilities of the Regents, a safeguard sought by the Speaker. Mr. Silver agreed that 10 charter schools regardless of size and those with fewer than 250 students will fall outside the jurisdiction of the teachers' unions in the first year of operation, a plank sought by the Governor.</p>
        <p>The legislative package also allows New York's dairy farmers to join the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a longstanding item on Governor Pataki's wish list. Environmentalists and natural-food advocates support the compact as a way to help save small farmers. But consumer groups, rightly in our view, see it as a hidden milk tax on consumers that would hit poor families the hardest.</p>
