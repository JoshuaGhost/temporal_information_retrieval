        <p>As President Clinton stood in the Rose Garden on Saturday afternoon, denouncing the ''poisonous venom'' of Washington and declaring that ''we have a lot to do before we enter the 21st century,'' a few downcast members of his staff clustered together just beyond the circle of cameras and reporters.</p>
        <p>''We may have a lot to do, but that's different from saying anything can get done,'' one staff member said in a low tone. Immediate crises like Iraq will always get the President's attention, he added. But the test of whether Mr. Clinton's power is ebbing, he said, will come as the President tries to remake Social Security or choke off another bout of global economic turmoil of the kind that, only three months ago, seemed to be taking the United States economy over the edge.</p>
        <p>As the Senate heads into little-charted terrain in which the President is expected to stand trial, both the economy and Mr. Clinton's powers of persuasion at home and abroad also enter new territory.</p>
        <p>So far, the markets have shrugged off Washington's bitter season, rising even as the House of Representatives lurched toward the impeachment vote on Saturday. And Asian markets showed little reaction in the first trading after the vote.</p>
        <p>Foreign diplomats here have shown similar lack of alarm. Several  said this weekend that they had cabled their capitals advising that Mr. Clinton's impeachment is a particular form of Washington madness, a nasty partisan battle that is likely to distract the United States but not derail its policies.</p>
        <p>But market confidence, much like perceptions of American power, is quirky and subject to quick reversal. It was only 19 months ago that investors were still pouring money into Asia, convinced that its astounding growth could not be stopped by an economic bubble or political weakness. It was only a decade ago that Japan was regarded as the world's greatest rising power, despite a fractious government that seemed forever incapable of decisions or action.</p>
        <p>Now, all over Washington, there are murmured questions about how a prolonged Senate trial might unnerve markets, affect the economy and undercut belief in America's ability to lead.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who tells you that they understand how all this is going to play out in the next few months is kidding themselves,'' Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said the other day. Another Cabinet official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that President Clinton had been ''wrongly written off many times before,'' and then added that a prolonged trial, ''sooner or later -- whether it's dealing with the budget, or the markets, or the Russians -- is going to have a cost. The question is whether it's a big cost.''</p>
        <p>In some cases, the cost may be fairly evident. The common wisdom, which has often been wrong this year, is that the President has about six months to forge the outlines of a deal to overhaul Social Security. After next summer, the tradeoffs may become so politically difficult that neither party will want to touch it.</p>
        <p>A long trial would suck the oxygen out of that debate. ''Very little else would go on,'' Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said on CNN. ''The President would be completely consumed.''</p>
        <p>Just how much will be accomplished depends on the strategies the White House and Congressional Republicans pursue as they try to weather the impeachment process.</p>
        <p>In fact, the handling of the global financial crisis and its permutations -- dealing with a collapsing Russian economy, an increasingly recalcitrant China and a new European currency, now only weeks away -- could pose the true test of Mr. Clinton's credibility in both the markets and the world.</p>
        <p>Even a weakened President has extraordinary powers in a military challenge of the kind posed during the Iraq crisis over the last week. Bipartisan support is expected, even though several Republican leaders questioned whether Mr. Clinton was using the cruise-missile attacks for political advantage.</p>
        <p>But in the far more complicated and subtle realm of trying to shape international economic strategies to restore growth and prevent more social explosions of the kind that rocked Indonesia, there is no such expectation of bipartisan cooperation. Such slow-burn crises require the President to convince both investors and other leaders that his authority is undiminished.</p>
        <p>''The sense is that the global markets haven't clicked in on this,'' Daniel Yergin, the chairman of the consulting group Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of a recent book on national economic power, said this weekend.</p>
        <p>''If the impeachment had happened in October, when even the most senior people in Government were talking about the end of modern capitalism as we know it,'' he said, ''we might be looking at a very different global economic situation today. The requirement at that time was to restore confidence -- and the fact that the world is shrugging off impeachment is evidence that confidence was restored. But the next time, it could be playing with fire.''</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Clinton will soon face the question of whether to resume economic aid to Russia. Even for a President at the peak of his game, it would be a difficult choice: Failure to provide aid could lead to charges that he ''lost Russia'' politically, while providing aid could open him to contentions that he lost billions of dollars propping up a nonfunctioning economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will also have to decide whether to change tactics with China, which is jailing dissidents and closing markets, just at a time when he had hoped to say that his management of economic and diplomatic relations with the Chinese was his greatest foreign policy achievement.</p>
        <p>None of these problems, of course, were relevant in the last impeachment trial, involving the President of a rising power in 1868.</p>
        <p>''The Johnson impeachment created no real rumblings about the American scene, except to confirm the European view that American are barbarous and uncouth,'' said David Donald, the Harvard historian, who has spent a lifetime studying the Civil War and Reconstruction.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have to worry about world markets then, or really foreign policy, because there wasn't much foreign policy,'' Professor Donald concluded. ''In almost every sense, it was exactly the reverse of the Clinton impeachment.''</p>
