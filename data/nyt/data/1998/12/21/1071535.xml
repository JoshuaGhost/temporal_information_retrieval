      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Louis K. Sher, a movie exhibitor who pioneered the showing of foreign films, died on Nov. 25 in Phoenix, Ariz. He was 84.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sher opened his first movie theater in 1954 in Columbus, Ohio, and made foreign films his specialty. He eventually built a national chain called the Art Theater Guild, which at one time included more than 50 theaters. In addition to foreign films, Mr. Sher showed the work of Andy Warhol and Shirley Clark as well as the early films of George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. He was a key figure in the obscenity trial involving Louis Malle's 1958 film ''The Lovers,'' which brought a ruling by the United States Supreme Court that the film was not pornographic.</p>
