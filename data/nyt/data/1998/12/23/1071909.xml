        <p>Ace Ltd., a fast-growing Bermuda insurance company, is negotiating to buy the large commercial insurance business of the Cigna Corporation, a leading health insurer, both companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement, the companies said they expected the final price to exceed $3 billion.</p>
        <p>The transaction would catapult Ace, a specialty insurer with $1 billion in revenue last year, to a leading commercial insurer in the United States and abroad with revenue of more than $6 billion.</p>
        <p>For Cigna, a sale of its commercial insurance business would free the company to further concentrate on health insurance and other employee benefits, a refocusing undertaken by many insurers that once tried to offer coverage for almost everything.</p>
        <p>''This makes a lot of sense for both parties,'' said Weston M. Hicks, an insurance analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.</p>
        <p>Cigna shares advanced $1.50, to $79.125, and Ace rose $1.375, to $28.9475. Trading of both stocks had been halted at the opening yesterday  before the companies confirmed a Reuters report on the talks.</p>
        <p>In the joint statement, Brian Duperreault, the chief executive of Ace, described Cigna's commercial business as ''one of the premier global property and casualty franchises.''</p>
        <p>But some analysts doubt whether Ace can make money from Cigna's commercial business, where revenue has been declining for years. At $3 billion, analysts said, Ace would be paying 1.5 times the book value of the Cigna commercial business.</p>
        <p>''I would think they would be paying book value at best,'' said Ira L. Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities Ltd., in Westport, Conn. ''If you could cut $100 million out of Cigna's expenses you could make a deal like this profitable.''</p>
        <p>Such expense cutting might be possible if another big insurer were the buyer, Mr. Zuckerman said, but Ace's relatively small size means there is little overlap between the two companies.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said they believed the negotiations between Ace and Cigna had been either initiated or accelerated by the announcement two weeks ago that Aetna Inc., already one of the nation's biggest health insurers, was buying the health care business of the Prudential Insurance Company of America for $1 billion.</p>
        <p>By increasing their size, the giant health insurers are able to negotiate more favorable deals with doctors, hospitals and insurance customers. To keep up, the analysts said, Cigna appeared to be under pressure to increase its own health care business by buying up a competitor.</p>
        <p>''My read is that Cigna could get money from the sale of its commercial business and then buy another health care company,'' said Kenneth S. Zuckerberg, an analyst at Keefe  Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc.</p>
        <p>Cigna has said previously that it was intent upon expanding its health care and other employee benefit businesses. But neither Cigna nor Ace would discuss their strategies in connnection with the current negotiations.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said Cigna might also want to use the proceeds of the sale to upgrade its computer systems to improve its competitiveness in managing health care costs.</p>
        <p>While Cigna has not been as profitable as some competitors in commercial insurance, it has been in the black in the last few years since the resolution of expensive asbestos-related claims, which hurt many insurers.</p>
        <p>Much of Ace's growth since its founding 14 years ago has come through acquisitions. But nothing it has bought in the past comes close to the deal it is now contemplating. Its two largest acquisitions, Tempest Re in 1996 and Cat Ltd. last April, were for about $700 million each.</p>
