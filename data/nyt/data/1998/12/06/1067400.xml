        <p>WHAT does a drummer in a Broadway show do on a night off? If he is Jared Crawford, who created and performs the percussion features in ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' he drums.</p>
        <p>Every Sunday night for the last month or so, Mr. Crawford and three percussion-playing colleagues, all of whom take turns as members of the two-man onstage drum team in ''Noise/Funk,'' have been presenting ''Keep Bangin','' a show conceived and staged by Mr. Crawford, at the Baggot Inn on West Third Street in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>In ''Keep Bangin','' Mr. Crawford sings and dances to the accompaniment of a four-piece band, and he and his fellow drummers pound, mostly all at once, on a variety of instruments and surfaces. In addition to presenting an expanded version of the crowd-pleasing pots-and-pans routine from ''Noise/Funk,'' they generate rhythms from an arsenal including, but not limited to, bongos, conga, timbales, cowbells, wood blocks, African drums, microphone stands, the floor and even a traditional drum kit.</p>
        <p>The show, which can run from an hour to an hour and a half, aims to do for percussion roughly what ''Noise/Funk'' has done for tap dancing: put it in historical perspective and garner it some new respect.</p>
        <p>''I want to bring the drums to the front, you know what I mean?'' said Mr. Crawford, 22, perched in sunglasses and a leather jacket in the Ambassador Theater before a recent performance of ''Noise/Funk.''  ''Every time you see, like, James Brown or whoever -- not to knock anybody, I love James Brown -- but it's like you always see the drum in the back, hiding. And it's one of the main things in any band; if the drummer's not kicking, it's not happening.''</p>
        <p>Even before the announcement late last month that the Tony Award-winning ''Noise/Funk'' would close on Jan. 10, Mr. Crawford's long-range goal, he said, has been to bring his own show -- ''which is basically my impression and my partners' of how we feel about rhythm'' -- to Broadway. ''I have a big vision,'' he added with a cheerful grin.</p>
        <p>Percussion has been a passion of his; six years ago, when he was a student at Julia Richmond High School in Manhattan, it became a profession. ''I've always just played the drums,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''And then I needed to do it to pay the rent.'' He and a high school friend, Larry Wright, began drumming for pocket money on plastic buckets on the streets of their native Manhattan and even hustling the occasional nightclub gig. Eventually, they decided to leave school, get an apartment and become full-time musicians.</p>
        <p>''I was living with my grandmother, who was very strict,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''I had to be home by a certain time every night, and that was getting harder to do when I started working in clubs and stuff.''</p>
        <p>The title of his show is an affectionate tribute to his grandmother, who, he recalled, ''always used to say, when I was little, 'Boy, why you keep bangin' on everything all the time?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crawford and Mr. Wright were eventually joined by two of Mr. Crawford's cousins, Raymond King and Daryl Dove Jr. And when Savion Glover heard Mr. Crawford play and asked him to ''make up some drum stuff'' for the show Mr. Glover was choreographing that would ultimately become ''Noise/Funk'' at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, Mr. Crawford got his colleagues involved.</p>
        <p>The Baggot Inn version of ''Keep Bangin' '' is scaled down from the show of the same name that Mr. Crawford presented for one night last year at the Miller Theater at Columbia University. It lacks the sets and costumes used in the theater performance, which was the model for what he dreams of bringing to Broadway. But the nightclub ''Keep Bangin' '' has the same basic structure: a series of vignettes paying tribute to some of the percussionists Mr. Crawford admires (among them Tito Puente, Max Roach and Buddy Rich), while presenting his take on both the roots of African-American drumming and his own roots as a teen-age street drummer.</p>
        <p>The club show differs from the stage version in two other ways. The musicians are joined by a different guest performer every week -- Mr. Glover, who starred in ''Noise/ Funk'' (to which he is returning on Tuesday), has dropped by, and the singer Lauryn Hill, with whom Mr. Crawford also works, has been invited. At the finale, Mr. Crawford asks audience members to mount the stage, grab a drum or some drumsticks and play along.</p>
        <p>''If you've got some rhythm inside you, you can come up and express it,'' he said. ''Bang on a chair, bang on the floor, whatever.'' He acknowledged that such an open invitation could result in chaos, but added that so far, it had worked out well, probably because anyone brave enough to take the Baggot Inn stage is likely, at the very least, to be able to keep time.</p>
        <p>''Either he's pretty confident,'' Mr. Crawford said of the typical participant, ''or he's had a couple of drinks. And so far, everyone's been cool.''</p>
