        <p>The United States and 32 other countries concluded four days of arms control meetings here with a public commitment to exercise ''maximum restraint'' before selling weapons to regions of conflict.</p>
        <p>Behind closed doors, the delegates to the so-called Wassenaar regime, an arms control organization that came into being after the cold war, made clear that the areas they were most concerned about were Central Africa, where a half dozen countries are fighting in Congo, and the Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia and Eritrea are on the brink of full-scale war.</p>
        <p>For at least two Wassenaar countries, the pledge of restraint seems somewhat hollow.</p>
        <p>This week, Russia will begin shipping the first contingent of $150 million worth of combat aircraft, helicopters and other military equipment to Ethiopia. And Bulgaria said last week that it had recently issued licenses for the sale of tanks to Ethiopia and Uganda.</p>
        <p>''That's not consistent with any commitment to maximum vigilance,'' bristled a Western diplomat about the Russian sale, which was not known publicly until a few hours after the Wassenaar meeting closed here on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Neither sale violates the Wassenaar regime, or any other arms control treaties, which encourages advocates of greater curbs on the conventional weapons trade to campaign for new treaties that would keep weapons out of regional trouble spots. But Washington's efforts to put a few more teeth into Wassenaar have been thwarted by countries such as Russia and France, American and European diplomats say.</p>
        <p>The Bulgarian tank sales were first reported 10 days ago by a Bulgarian newspaper, Trud, which said that 140 tanks had been sold to Ethiopia. The newspaper reported that another deal, for 80 tanks, was pending, and these were going to Ethiopia and Uganda. Bulgaria acquired the T-55 tanks cheaply from Moscow during the cold War.</p>
        <p>In response to written questions, Bulgaria's Ministry for Trade confirmed on Thursday that licenses had been issued for tank sales to these countries, but it declined to discuss the details.</p>
        <p>Uganda is not in the market for used tanks, American officials in Africa say, but it had been giving support to the rebels in Congo, and has been the provider of weapons to rebels in southern Sudan, who have surprised observers with the remarkable number of tanks they have fielded in recent months.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Bulgaria, which has seen its military industries decline, has become a prime arms bazaar, supplying rebel groups from  Sri Lanka to Congo.</p>
        <p>The Ethiopian deal earned the Bulgarian Government $4.4 million in profit, Trud reported. An obviously pleased senior defense official told Trud that it was the best commercial year for the ministry since it sold tanks to Yemen in 1994.</p>
        <p>During the Wassenaar meetings here, Bulgarian diplomats were chagrined that their defense officials were gloating so openly about the deal, other diplomats who attended the meetings said.</p>
        <p>American and European diplomats say that the Bulgarian Government is deeply concerned about the country's negative image as a result of reports of its arms trading, and that the Foreign Ministry in particular would like to clean up the practices. But it is not clear whether the arms industry will be swayed.</p>
        <p>The United States has largely ignored Bulgaria's arms dealings, but American officials say that is about to change, and that the American Ambassador in Bulgaria, Avis Bohlen, intends to raise it in her meetings with Bulgarian officials.</p>
        <p>To date, the Clinton Administration, while unhappy about the tank sales to Ethiopia, has not said anything publicly or made any official protests to the Bulgarian Government, said an official in Washington, who believes that this is what needs to be done. Like others, this official would discuss Bulgaria's arms sales only on condition he not be identified.</p>
        <p>In order to curb the flow of weapons to troubled regions, Washington has been trying to strengthen Wassenaar. During the meetings this week, for example, American diplomats pushed to name the countries to which arms should not be sold, such as Ethiopia and Eritrea. A majority of the Wassenaar members supported the United States, but the organization operates by consensus and there were objections.</p>
        <p>There are 33 members of the Wassenaar regime, which is named for the Dutch city where agreement was first reached in 1995 to exchange information on sales, if only after the fact. The organization has been largely ineffective at stopping any transfers of conventional weapons.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to see what value Wassenaar is,'' said Lora Lumpe, an arms trade analyst who is currently on leave from the Federation of American Scientists to work on arms control issues at the Peace Research Institute of Oslo.</p>
        <p>Wassenaar meetings, like the one here last week, are behind closed doors, and it does not release the data it compiles on sales.</p>
        <p>''Because the information is not made public, it is hard to evaluate what it has done,'' Ms. Lumpe said.</p>
