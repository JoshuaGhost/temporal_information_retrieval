        <p>The answer to the question ''Where's Grandpa?,'' posed by Walter Goodman in his review of my two daughters' picture book, ''You Can't Take a Balloon Into the Metropolitan Museum'' (Children's Books in Brief, Nov. 15), is that Grandpa can be seen on the back cover sitting in front of the Met enjoying his favorite pastime, the New York Times crossword puzzle, because his arthritic knee does not allow him to keep up with the young museumgoer.</p>

        <p>By the way, at our house the book occupies a prominent position on the coffee table, placed face down to disclose my caricature.</p>
