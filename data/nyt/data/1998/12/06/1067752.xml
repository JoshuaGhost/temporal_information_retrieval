        <p>When Cade McNown's final pass fell incomplete in the end zone today, U.C.L.A.'s 20-game winning streak, its shot at an undefeated season and, it seemed, its hopes for a national title ended in a wild 49-45 loss to Miami.</p>
        <p>Then Kansas State lost to Texas A&amp;M tonight, and suddenly the Bruins were back in the picture in the chaotic Bowl Championship Series.</p>
        <p>But after the game here at the Orange Bowl -- after Edgerrin James ran for 1 of his Big East- and school-record 299 rushing yards to score the winning touchdown with 50 seconds left -- the Bruins trudged off the field, presumably in shock at seeing a 38-21 late third-quarter lead disappear.</p>
        <p>''We just couldn't stop them,'' U.C.L.A. Coach Bob Toledo said. ''Our defense didn't play very well, and obviously if you can't play good defense you don't deserve to be a national champion.''</p>
        <p>The Bruins entered the game second in the B.C.S. ranking, one spot ahead of Kansas State. If they do not qualify for the national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl, they will go to the Rose Bowl as champions of the Pacific-10 Conference.</p>
        <p>The defeat came in the makeup of a game originally scheduled for Sept. 26 and postponed because of Hurricane Georges.</p>
        <p>On the Miami sideline after the game, Athletic Director Paul Dee clenched his fists and jumped in joy.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had a game like this in 10 years,'' Dee shouted above the din from the crowd of 46,819. ''It's wonderful. We're back.''</p>
        <p>For the Hurricanes, 8-3 and headed to the Micron PC Bowl at nearby Pro Player Stadium, the showing provided some solace after their 53-point beating by Syracuse the week before.</p>
        <p>''This game was about getting our respect back,'' Miami Coach Butch Davis said. ''We asked not one single person to surrender until the game was over, and not one did. It took every ounce of heart and soul we could muster to win.''</p>
        <p>Miami, four-time national champions, went a decade without losing in the Orange Bowl, but had lost 8 of its last 14 games here after 1995 N.C.A.A. probation.</p>
        <p>''This game says a lot about Coach Davis and this team to come from where we were last Saturday to what we did today,'' said Scott Covington, the Miami senior quarterback who threw for 318 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>The game evolved into a battle between U.C.L.A.'s McNown and Miami's Covington and James.</p>
        <p>McNown accounted for 6 touchdowns, 5 by passing. He completed 26 of 35 passes for 513 yards, with his touchdowns going, in order, for 77, 7, 14, 61 and 59 yards. He also scored on a 1-yard option run.</p>
        <p>James was equally as spectacular for Miami. With the backup running back James Jackson suspended for an undisclosed team violation, James had to do yeoman work. And he did -- rushing 39 times. He scored three times, on runs of 45 yards, 10 yards and 1 yard.</p>
        <p>''U.C.L.A. probably came in here thinking they were going to win easy,'' James said. ''But they didn't understand what this program is all about.''</p>
        <p>James's winning score came after a disputed lost fumble by U.C.L.A. receiver Brad Melsby at the Miami 26-yard line with 3 minutes 24 seconds remaining, with the Bruins ready to put the game away. Toledo leaped in anger on the U.C.L.A. sideline when the Hurricanes were awarded the ball, and replays appeared to show that Melsby's knee was down before he lost the ball.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes then went 74 yards in eight plays to beat only their second ranked opponent in nine tries under Davis.</p>
        <p>''For the first time this year we got to use the Orange Bowl heat to our advantage,'' Covington said. ''We got to grinding them down and I saw a lot of poise on that last drive.''</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A. wasn't finished. It quickly moved deep into Miami territory.  McNown had two final chances from the Miami 29, and both passes fell incomplete.</p>
        <p>Drew Bennett saw McNown's last pass slip through his grasp in the end zone as time expired.</p>
        <p>Miami's James had 173 yards rushing by halftime, as the Hurricanes built a 21-17 lead.</p>
        <p>The Fiesta Bowl executive director, John Junker, took the occasion to hark back to a sequence that had dramatically changed the Bruins' game earlier this season against ranked Arizona.</p>
        <p>''They scored 21 points almost before you could blink,'' Junker said. ''With their offense, that could happen again here, and it'll be interesting to see if Miami can overcome it.''</p>
        <p>What Junker envisioned indeed unfolded in today's second half. The Bruins scored twice in the third quarter in five plays and added another touchdown by quarter's end to seemingly assure a victory.</p>
        <p>Yet the Hurricanes on this day had more resilience than they've shown since their championship runs of the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''I know one thing,'' Davis said at the end, flashing a wide smile. ''We made 6.5 million people in Kansas happy today.''</p>
