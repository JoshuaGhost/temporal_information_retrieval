        <p>STEVEN PRESCOTT grabbed a clipboard, a No. 2 pencil and some scrap paper and took a seat alongside 100 other nerve-racked men in a stuffy, overheated basement in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>''Hope I do well,'' Mr. Prescott, a graduate student, muttered as he glanced at a neighbor, whose hand appeared to be jealously shielding a standardized test form. A sociology midterm? Hardly, unless you consider the Single Gay Man in Premillennium New York a subject worthy of academic study.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prescott, 31, recently dumped and hungry for holiday-season company, was braving Date Bait, a brutally efficient, high-tech mixer that tries to ease the sting of face-to-face rejection by using a computer to make matches.</p>
        <p>Created two years ago by Rafael Risemberg, a dateless psychology professor who was weary of the bar scene, Date Bait has become a huge draw among gay men in their 30's and 40's, and the Saturday night events, held at A Different Light bookstore on West 19th Street, are often so crowded that dozens are turned away at the door.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Risemberg says, his matchmaking method has produced 4,837 dates, although he does not track how many of those led to second dates. ''That is something only God knows,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Spurred by the popularity of the events, Mr. Risemberg has started a series of nights for heterosexuals, lesbians and H.I.V.-positive men. ''I never knew it, but I must have been born with some Jewish matchmaking gene,'' said Mr. Risemberg, 39, who has reaped several dates from his own events, but still remains unattached.</p>
        <p>Date Bait affairs couldn't be less fussy: identified with a name tag and three-digit number, participants sit on chairs that are arranged in a square. After each person has stood and delivered a brief description of himself, the seats are cleared for 45 minutes of ferocious mingling.</p>
        <p>''Limit conversations to one minute per person,'' Mr. Risemberg shouts as the men plunge into a frenzy of small talk. ''No hogging!''</p>
        <p>The mixing done, participants turn to their score cards -- those S.A.T.-style answer forms -- and begin shading in the ovals that correspond to the numbers worn by the prospects who appeal to them. Then comes a nervous 20-minute wait as the forms are fed into a scanner, which tabulates and coldly spits out pairs of matching numbers. The evening ends with instant gratification -- or deflation -- as men who have selected one another scurry to collect phone numbers.</p>
        <p>The anxiety was thick on a recent Saturday night as the conservatively dressed crowd -- mostly white and professional -- registered, paid a $15 entry fee and quietly took a seat. David Moschel, the evening's bubbly emcee, apologized for the heat, which he blamed on the room's incandescent lighting. ''We used to have fluorescent bulbs, but everyone complained about how green it made them look,'' he said. ''Now, everyone suffocates but at least they look good.''</p>
        <p>Before starting, Mr. Risemberg warned the group members to make their choices prudently. ''You are fully expected to go on a date with those you match,'' he said sternly, defining a date as a half-hour meeting in a public place. ''Violators should be reported to the Date Bait hot line and will be barred from future events.''</p>
        <p>The next hour was filled with a numbing litany of 30-second personal spiels that ranged from the standard theater-going/long-walk-loving/ hopeless-romantic variety to the self-deprecating and confessional. ''I have a really big mouth, but I'm kind hearted,'' said Rami, No. 031, while Otto, 077, admitted -- against a friend's advice -- that he lived in New Jersey. ''I can be in midtown in 30 minutes,'' he said meekly. Jeff, 001, back for the 28th time, offered the following description of himself: ''I'm a 40-year-old neurotic Jew from Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>Tom, 039, sparked groans when he said he had broken up with a boyfriend just five days earlier, as did Matt, 003, who blithely remarked that he had recently used his cell phone on the Stair Master. Heads shook with dismay when Rob, 099, said he enjoyed ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>Others tried unconventional appeals. Mark, 064, an accountant, offered any comers a discount on their 1998 taxes, and Joe, 015, said he was a nonsmoker but was willing to start for the right person. Doug, 030, a ''brilliant unrecognized artist from the East Village,'' made a straightforward appeal. ''I'm basically a nice person who doesn't have cooties, so go for me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then the madness began as participants mingled like ricocheting pinballs. Tim Bird, 35, who scribbled two dozen names of men who had caught his interest, appeared overwhelmed. ''I'm trying to whittle them down,'' Mr. Bird, a publicity agent, said as he crossed out three names, including a guy who had said that he wasn't interested in anyone with emotional baggage. ''Get real,'' Mr. Bird said. ''Who doesn't have emotional baggage?''</p>
        <p>Like many of the men, Jeff Suna, 43, said he preferred Date Bait to personal ads and bars, veritable set-ups for embarrassment and disappointment. ''It's sort of like a secret ballot,'' he said. ''No one gets hurt.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone was thrilled by the bait. Matt Locker, 31, a radio station disc jockey with exceedingly white teeth, stood in a corner drawing smiley faces on his otherwise blank form. ''There's nothing here for me,'' he said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>Still, most of the participants agreed that Date Bait is an efficient way to meet men who are likely to be sober (no alcohol is served) and at least nominally interested in a relationship. ''At bars, the physical is primary,'' said John Bonelli, 35, a community organizer from the Clinton neighborhood of Manhattan. ''Here, looks are important, but there's something more holistic about it. Also, you can't posture as easily as you can in a bar.''</p>
        <p>David Harper, 35, an adjunct professor of economics at New York University, has proof that Date Bait works: one of the five dates he got last year turned into a serious relationship. ''From my point of view, they were three hours well spent,'' he said. Unlike rendezvous that originate in clubs or bars -- and often end in the morning -- Date Bait dates, he said, force gay men to pace themselves. ''And even if you don't get a date, at least you'll walk away with your ego intact,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After 28 spins, Jeff Rutsky, the Brooklyn neurotic, is still single, but he keeps coming back. ''I don't care, because I've made some good friends,'' he said. Once, after failing to score a date, he went to a nearby diner and ended up meeting another unrequited Date Bait participant. ''You know, we had a really nice time,'' Mr. Rutsky said.</p>
        <p>Before handing out the matches, Mr. Risemberg offered encouragement to those who were about to be disappointed. He said that 66 percent of the participants had been chosen by men who interested them, too, and 41 percent had two or more matches.  ''You think that two-thirds of people who go to a bar are going to go home with a date?'' he asked. ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>As the men collected the computer printouts, boyish smiles appeared on many faces. Steve Brickman, 23, a computer programmer from Brooklyn, was pleased with his two matches but said he felt strange after watching one of them swap phone numbers -- and a goodbye hug -- with another match. ''I didn't exactly feel like No. 1,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As the men began drifting out, Mr. Rutsky shook his head and offered a thumbs-down sign. ''I guess I'm going to the diner again,'' he said.</p>
