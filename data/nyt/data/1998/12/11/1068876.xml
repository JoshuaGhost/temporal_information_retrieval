        <p>Abe Hirschfeld, the New York real estate developer known for quixotic forays into politics and other high-profile misadventures, was charged yesterday with hiring a hit man to kill a longtime business partner with whom he had a bitter feud and survivor-takes-control agreements covering many of their properties.</p>
        <p>The 79-year-old businessman, who made headlines by offering Paula Jones $1 million this fall to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton, was accused of giving an intermediary $75,000 in cash to pay a hired gun to kill his 73-year-old associate, Stanley Stahl, in 1996, and of supplying photos and other information about the target in a note in his own handwriting.</p>

        <p>Abe Hirschfeld, the New York real estate developer known for quixotic forays into politics and other high-profile misadventures, was charged yesterday with hiring a hit man to kill a longtime business partner with whom he had a bitter feud and survivor-takes-control agreements covering many of their properties.</p>
        <p>The 79-year-old businessman, who made headlines by offering Paula Jones $1 million this fall to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton, was accused of giving an intermediary $75,000 in cash to pay a hired gun to kill his 73-year-old associate, Stanley Stahl, in 1996, and of supplying photos and other information about the target in a note in his own handwriting.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, who said he also had witnesses and tape recordings to prove the case, said Mr. Hirschfeld promised to make a second payment of more than $75,000 after Mr. Stahl was slain. But, he said, the scheme fell apart for murky reasons, and Mr. Stahl got wind of it, went to the authorities and began riding in a bulletproof limousine.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't feel too happy if somebody paid $150,000 to have me knocked off,'' Mr. Morgenthau said at a news conference when asked whether Mr. Stahl's life had ever been in danger. He noted, however, that Mr. Stahl, a partner of Mr. Hirschfeld's for decades until their relationship soured, was still alive.</p>
        <p>''Not guilty -- it's all lies,'' Mr. Hirschfeld declared at a Criminal Court arraignment in which he was ordered released on $1 million cash bail -- to which he responded by pulling out his wallet and offering the judge the $1 million bank check that had been made out to Paula Jones but never accepted. The court did not accept it either, and gave Mr. Hirschfeld until Monday to pay the bail.</p>
        <p>Afterward, speaking to reporters and television cameras outside the Criminal Courts Building, Mr. Hirschfeld amplified on his innocence. He charged that a former secretary, Rosemary Singer, and a former construction supervisor of his, Joe Veltri, had proposed killing Mr. Stahl and had threatened to accuse him of plotting a murder for hire if he did not pay them $500,000. He said he refused.</p>
        <p>''I never hired nobody to kill him,'' Mr. Hirschfeld said. ''I don't get one penny of benefit by killing him.'' He insisted that his partnership agreements with Mr. Stahl, canceled last February, provided that the heirs of each would be the beneficiaries in the event that either died; prosecutors, however, say the surviving partner would have retained control over most of the properties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld acknowledged having given $75,000 to Mr. Veltri in the fall of 1996, but he called it a bonus for 20 years of loyal work. Ms. Singer, his secretary for 32 years, and Mr. Veltri were subsequently dismissed for reasons that were unclear yesterday. Efforts to reach both last night were unavailing.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's events began with a bizarre scene shortly after midnight when Mr. Morgenthau's detectives went to Mr. Hirschfeld's home at 825 Fifth Avenue to arrest him. Mr. Morgenthau said Mr. Hirschfeld, indicted earlier this week, had been invited to surrender voluntarily but had refused and had even fired his lawyer, Charles Haydon, for suggesting that he accept the offer.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hirschfeld insisted that he had an agreement with the prosecutor to surrender at 7:30 A.M., and when the detectives showed up at his apartment he first proposed that they all stay until morning -- he in handcuffs, if necessary -- and get a good night's sleep. He said he offered them coffee and dessert.</p>
        <p>When they refused, he and other witnesses said, he dropped his pants and suggested a lewd act, called 911 to report a robbery in progress and, after the police arrived and the confusion was cleared up, was taken away in handcuffs. ''Oh, yes,'' he said, ''I called 911 because they wanted to take me in naked.''</p>
        <p>Held overnight in a detectives' squad room, Mr. Hirschfeld called various members of the news media to protest his innocence and to complain about his treatment at the hands of Mr. Morgenthau, who had obtained an indictment of the developer last year on state income-tax evasion charges, a case that is pending.</p>
        <p>After what he called a night on the floor, Mr. Hirschfeld called the media again to complain that he had not been allowed to attend a news briefing at which Mr. Morgenthau announced his indictment and arrest. In the afternoon, Mr. Hirschfeld went to court in a crumpled blue suit and a gray shirt open at the neck. His sparse hair was tousled and a light stubble flecked his round face.</p>
        <p>Arraigned on charges of criminal solicitation in the second degree, which is subject to seven years in prison, Mr. Hirschfeld, still in handcuffs, pleaded not guilty before Acting State Supreme Court Justice Laura E. Drager. Assistant District Attorney Gilda Mariani asked for $2.5 million cash bail.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hirschfeld's lawyer, Theodore R. Kupferman, noted that his client was free on a $1 million bond in the 123-count tax evasion case, which accuses him of failing to pay $2.2 million in state taxes from 1988 to 1995, and that a judge in that pending case allowed Mr. Hirschfeld to go to Israel. ''If he wanted to flee, that was his chance,'' Mr. Kupferman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld, who was born in Poland and emigrated from Israel to America in the 1950's, and Mr. Stahl, the son of a Brooklyn butcher, had been partners in real estate since the 1960's, and both made millions. Mr. Stahl, a quieter man, staked everything he had in 1962 to build a 50-story office tower at 277 Park Avenue, which became the centerpiece of a business that includes office and apartment buildings, some jointly held with Mr. Hirschfeld.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld made a fortune in parking lots and other real estate, and has run largely self-financed but losing races for lieutenant governor of New York and for Congress and Manhattan borough president. He had a brief, turbulent reign as publisher of The New York Post in 1993.</p>
        <p>Court records show that many of their partnerships were ownership agreements for particular buildings, including 405 East 54th Street, 404 East 55th Street and 360 East 55th Street. But their relationship began to sour around 1991, when each became suspicious that the other was cheating.</p>
        <p>The suspicions led to lawsuits in which Mr. Hirschfeld demanded that Mr. Stahl sell out or buy out Mr. Hirschfeld's interests. Mr. Stahl refused and countersued. Mr. Hirschfeld charged that Mr. Stahl discriminated against blacks in renting apartments; Mr. Stahl said the charges were brought by ''agent provocateurs'' hired by Mr. Hirschfeld.</p>
        <p>There were disputes about who should have check-signing privileges, where money should be kept, how company books should be kept and other matters. The disputes, Mr. Hirschfeld contended, made it impossible for him to file his tax returns. The suits were full of invective. Mr. Stahl called Mr. Hirschfeld ''incredible.'' Mr. Hirschfeld said Mr. Stahl was ''like Alice in Wonderland,'' and charged ''generosity has never been Mr. Stahl's strong suit.''</p>
        <p>Neither side budged and the feud reached a nadir in 1996. Mr. Morgenthau charged that Mr. Hirschfeld then paid $75,000 as a first installment to have Mr. Stahl killed. The cash, he said, was given by an intermediary to ''a person in the back seat of a chauffeured limousine parked near Hirschfeld's office building at 15 Penn Plaza.''</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Morgenthau said, Mr. Hirschfeld's intermediary delivered a second envelope bearing ''photographs of Stahl taken by a private investigator'' and ''a note written by Hirschfeld with Stahl's name, address, a telephone number and his car's license plate number.''</p>
        <p>Other investigators said the plot went awry, before the second installment was paid, when the intermediary was ''roughed up'' -- it was unclear by whom or why. The intermediary then disclosed the scheme to Mr. Stahl, who informed the authorities, and the investigation that led to yesterday's charges was begun.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 12, 1998, Saturday  An article yesterday about the accusation that Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer, hired a hit man to kill a business partner misstated his past connection with The New York Post. (The error also appeared in a profile of Mr. Hirschfeld yesterday.) He never owned The Post; he had a contract to buy it and a management contract to run it.</p>
