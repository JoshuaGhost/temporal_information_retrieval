        <p>Tens of millions of Nigerians are expected to vote in local government elections on Saturday in the first of three elections that the military rulers have promised will lead to democracy.</p>
        <p>The borders will be closed during the voting hours, officials said, to prevent candidates from paying foreigners to vote illegally.

        <p>Tens of millions of Nigerians are expected to vote in local government elections on Saturday in the first of three elections that the military rulers have promised will lead to democracy.</p>
        <p>The borders will be closed during the voting hours, officials said, to prevent candidates from paying foreigners to vote illegally. In Lagos, the largest city, the authorities announced that most cars would be banned from the streets and that  pedestrians would be limited to areas near voting centers.</p>
        <p>As dancers and musicians hired by candidates to drum up support played their last songs today in the neighborhoods of Lagos the mood seemed to vary from deep skepticism about the fairness and relevance of the election to great hope that Nigeria, where 1 in 6 Africans lives, is finally turning a new page.</p>
        <p>Many residents, though, appeared more preoccupied with the price of fuel, which has skyrocketed, to $4.30 a gallon from $2.60 a few days ago. The sudden long lines at gasoline  stations seemed to symbolize the problems of the sixth-largest oil producer in the world, but where widespread corruption has led to chronic gasoline shortages.</p>
        <p>''I registered and will vote because I want the present system to change,'' Faith Omozejele, 27, a shop owner, said. ''Do you like the system we are running? No fuel, no light, no roads, no water. Transportation is too costly.''</p>
        <p>At stake in the elections are seats in 774 municipal governments. Nigeria will hold elections for statewide seats next month and for the presidency in February.</p>
        <p>But the results from the voting on Saturday will determine which parties qualify to run in the bigger races, and they should provide an early glimpse into how fair the presidential elections will be in this country of deep ethnic, religious and regional divisions.</p>
        <p>The elections are being held after six months of turbulence. Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled ruthlessly for five years and turned Nigeria into an international pariah, died suddenly in June. Adding to the chaos was the sudden death in July of Moshood K. O. Abiola, who had appeared set to win a presidential election in 1993 before the military annulled it. Mr. Abiola was imprisoned on charges of treason in 1994.</p>
        <p>Discontent has been spreading in southeast Nigeria, where the oil is produced but which has been badly neglected by the northern military rulers. Members of ethnic groups in the Niger River Delta seized oil stations that belong to Western oil companies, and members of the Ijaw group in one oil town, Warri, have threatened to disrupt the elections.</p>
        <p>General Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, pledged a transition to a civilian government by May, released political prisoners and undertook other changes that have earned him good reviews in the West. General Abubakar also created the Independent National Electoral Commission, appointing as its chairman a respected judge, Ephraim Akpata, to oversee the elections.</p>
        <p>Irregularities have been reported in registering voters. Almost 60 million voters' cards were issued. But the commission said it could not account for 20 million, suggesting that some candidates stole cards.</p>
        <p>Margaret Ehiakhame, 32, a student, was one of many people who said she had been unable to register.</p>
        <p>''I made several attempts to register,'' Miss Ehiakhame said. ''But each time I was told that there were no cards. I wonder why, because sometimes I got to the voters' registration center as early as 10 o'clock in the morning. I wonder why I have to be disenfranchised.''</p>
        <p>Western officials who are observing the elections predicted that difficulties might arise from logistical problems and some corruption, though not extensive fraud.</p>
        <p>Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an umbrella organization of 45 Nigerian monitoring groups, said he thought the elections would generally be fair. ''But there's no doubt that there's some credibility problem,'' Mr. Nwankwo added.</p>
        <p>Segun Jegede, director of a human rights organization, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, said his organization would not take part in the elections because he believed the process was fundamentally flawed.</p>
        <p>''There is no constitution on which the election is going to be based,'' Mr. Jegede said, voicing the common criticism that the Government has not called a national convention to settle on a constitution and other problems. ''I think monitoring will only be giving credibility to this fraudulent process,'' Mr. Jegede added.</p>
        <p>Monitoring organizations and Nigerian newspapers have complained that the candidates of the nine parties have talked little about the issues, focusing instead on the well-known figures that head each party. Some politicians have even acknowledged the criticism, though typically about their rivals.</p>
        <p>''We in the Alliance for Democracy are more concerned about raising the fundamental issues of restructuring, because it's at the heart of the problems of this country, while the other parties prefer to skirt it,'' said Adeola Adefolabi, who is running for chairmanship of a district here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adefolabi's party is made up of longtime opponents of military rule and is considered to have strong support in the southwest. That party and two others, the People's Democratic Party and the All People's Party, have the greatest national appeal.</p>
