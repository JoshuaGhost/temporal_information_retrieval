        <p>LIKE a grand piano-sized floral arrangement at a mob funeral, historical respect has finally been laid before the memory of Charles (Lucky) Luciana, who changed his surname to Luciano as a rising young mafioso because he somehow thought it was easier to spell. Last week, Time magazine included the ur-Godfather, who consolidated the blood-feuding gangsters of the Prohibition era into a centrally supervised criminal syndicate that became known as the Mafia, on its list of the 100 ''most influential business geniuses of the century.''</p>
        <p>Luciano, enthused Time, ''used Standard &amp; Poor's as much as Smith &amp; Wesson'' to succeed in business. But New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former prosecutor, took issue, pointing out that Luciano's rise to the top was based mostly on ''murdering lots of people.''</p>

        <p>LIKE a grand piano-sized floral arrangement at a mob funeral, historical respect has finally been laid before the memory of Charles (Lucky) Luciana, who changed his surname to Luciano as a rising young mafioso because he somehow thought it was easier to spell. Last week, Time magazine included the ur-Godfather, who consolidated the blood-feuding gangsters of the Prohibition era into a centrally supervised criminal syndicate that became known as the Mafia, on its list of the 100 ''most influential business geniuses of the century.''</p>
        <p>Luciano, enthused Time, ''used Standard &amp; Poor's as much as Smith &amp; Wesson'' to succeed in business. But New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former prosecutor, took issue, pointing out that Luciano's rise to the top was based mostly on ''murdering lots of people.''</p>
        <p>Whatever his recipe for success, Luciano was undoubtedly the mob's first modern business visionary. Today's bookshelves are crowded with self-help books from celebrated tycoons. If Luciano had written one, here are some lessons he might have offered.</p>
        <p>JOE SHARKEY</p>
        <p>Start Networking Early</p>
        <p>In 1907, the 10-year-old Luciano, a Sicilian immigrant on the tough streets of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, was arrested for shoplifting:</p>
        <p>During the same year he started his first racket. For a penny or two a day, Luciano offered younger and smaller Jewish kids his personal protection against beatings on the way to school. If they didn't pay, he beat them up. One runty kid refused to pay, a thin little youngster from Poland, Meyer Lansky. Luciano attacked him and was amazed when Lansky gave as good as he got. They became bosom buddies after that.</p>
        <p>--''The Mafia Encyclopedia,'' by  Carl Sifakis (Facts on File, 1987)</p>
        <p>Don't Settle for Chump Change</p>
        <p>Luciano dropped out of school and worked briefly for $7 a week in a hat factory. But after winning $244 in a craps game, he never did another honest day's work.</p>
        <p>''Who wants to wind up being a crumb?' he remarked to a friend. ''I'd rather drop dead.''</p>
        <p>''The Luciano Story,'' by Sid Feder and  Joachim Joesten (Da Capo Press, 1994)</p>
        <p>All Work and No Play . . .</p>
        <p>One day, when Luciano and an associate were pulled over for running a red light on Fifth Avenue, Luciano explained to the officer that the arsenal of pistols, shotgun and bullets plainly visible in the back seat were actually sports gear.</p>
        <p>''We just come back from hunting,'' was his easy explanation.</p>
        <p>''What were you hunting?''</p>
        <p>''Oh, peasants.'</p>
        <p>''Pheasants?''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, that's right. Pheasants.''</p>
        <p>--''The Luciano Story''</p>
        <p>Respond Quickly to Public Relation Crises</p>
        <p>In 1931, Luciano decided that merger and acquisition was the way to expand his fledgling mob empire. He lured the reigning kingpin, Giuseppe (Joe the Boss) Masseria, to lunch at a Coney Island restaurant, where four of his henchmen barged in and riddled the old-timer with bullets after Luciano excused himself to go to the men's room. Luciano later told reporters that of course he had heard the gunfire.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I finished drying my hands, I hurried out and walked back to see what it was about.''</p>
        <p>--''Murder Inc.,'' by Sid Feder and  Burton Turkus (Farrar, Straus &amp; Young, 1951)</p>
        <p>Be Upwardly Mobile</p>
        <p>''Prior to Prohibition,'' Sol Gelb, a New York criminal attorney in the 1920's, said . . . ''a hoodlum was a hoodlum. A fellow who committed crimes never mixed with respectable people. [After Luciano] they began to look and act the same as respectable people.''</p>
        <p>''Blood and Power: Organized Crime in 20th-Century America,'' by Stephen Fox (William Morrow, 1989)</p>
        <p>Dress for Success</p>
        <p>Luciano's men were ordered to dress neatly and conservatively, like office workers, to avoid wide-brimmed hats, loud shirts and ties, garish suits completely. ''Let Capone and the Chicago guys do that. We won't.''</p>
        <p>''The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano,''by Martin A. Gosch and Richard Hammer (Little, Brown, 1974)</p>
        <p>''He leaned maybe a degree or two to the liberal side of conservative,'' is the way one gentlemen's couturier put it. ''But always in the height of style.'' --''The Luciano Story''</p>
        <p>Encourage Zero-Defect Productivity</p>
        <p>Of recalcitrant employees, Luciano recalled:</p>
        <p>I just tried to make 'em understand the penalties of stupidity. . . . Some guys got their fingers broke or their knuckles cracked or maybe had their heads busted. They hadda learn how to do it the right way the next time.</p>
        <p>''The Last Testament''</p>
        <p>Maintain Tight Inventory Control</p>
        <p>We knew more about trucks and tight schedules than any company in the country. So we looked over the market and decided to put a little squeeze on here and there. . . . For example, milk spoils pretty fast and so does bread and vegetables In no time at all, we had a lock on three or four of the biggest fresh-food businesses in America. . . . After all, nothin' spoils faster'n fish.</p>
        <p>''The Last Testament''</p>
        <p>Look for New Synergies</p>
        <p>Luciano teamed with the Chicago newspaper executive Moses Annenberg to operate an illegal telephone wire service to supply instant horse-race results to bookie joints nationwide:</p>
        <p>The new racing wire had been worked out with the telephone company. To this day, that high-class corporation knows that it's the heart of the biggest gamblin' empire in the world. As far as Annenberg was concerned, he never could've operated without us. He needed us and we needed him. It was a good thing all around.</p>
        <p>''The Last Testament''</p>
        <p>Beware the Taxman</p>
        <p>In 1936, the New York Federal prosecutor (and future Governor) Thomas E. Dewey indicted Luciano on 90 counts of extortion and ''direction of organized harlotry.'' At his trial, Dewey ridiculed the multimillionaire Luciano's obviously bogus Federal tax returns, which showed he never made more than $22,500 a year.</p>
        <p>''You just picked those figures on your income out of the sky, didn't you'?'' Dewey finally charged.  ''I just thought it was the proper amount I should give the government,'' responded Lucky.</p>
        <p>''The Luciano Story''</p>
        <p>Play to Your Strengths</p>
        <p>When Luciano was convicted, his pre-sentencing report stated:</p>
        <p>He possesses average intelligence, but is a shallow and parasitic individual who is considerably wrapped up in his own feelings. His ideals of life resolved themselves into money to spend, beautiful women to enjoy, silk underclothes and places to go in style. His social outlook . . . is dominated by recklessness and a craving for action. His only asset as a leader consists of his apparent calmness in times of stress.</p>
        <p>''The Luciano Story''</p>
        <p>Think Globally</p>
        <p>During World War II, authorities sought out Luciano in prison to use his influence to prevent wartime sabotage or work slowdowns on the mob-controlled shipping docks.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he continued to maintain active leadership of the syndicate from behind bars. In 1946, Luciano was paroled for what was described by Governor Dewey as wartime services to the country . . . When he was released . . . Luciano was deported to Italy. He sneaked back to Cuba later that year to run the American syndicate from that off-shore island. From Cuba, Luciano approved the execution of Bugsy Siegel for looting the syndicate's money building the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''The Mafia Encyclopedia''</p>
        <p>Forced back to Italy, Luciano began arranging the mob's expansion into the global drug trade.</p>
        <p>Narcotics Bureau Supervisor Garland Williams charged that three months after Luciano's return [to Italy] from Cuba in 1947, the first large shipment of heroin, worth $250,000, was smuggled into the United States. --''The Luciano Story''</p>
        <p>Don't Trust Reporters . . .</p>
        <p>In exile, Luciano blamed the press for depicting him as the ''capo di tutti capi,'' the boss of all bosses of organized crime.</p>
        <p>''The American press is disgraceful,'' he blurted out. . . . ''There is too much freedom of the press in America. ... Someday, I'm gonna write my own memories,'' he said. ''Then the real story is gonna come out.'' --''The Luciano Story''</p>
        <p>. . . and Protect Your Movie Rights</p>
        <p>In his later years, Luciano bragged about what he felt was the inevitable movie deal. 'I got a lotta offers -- offers to pay me good, too. I'm not puttin' up a nickel of my own for it.''</p>
