        <p>WITH every year's crop of boxed sets, musicians and recording companies go deeper into their archives, hoping to tempt collectors as well as gift- givers. For many musicians, a boxed set is still mainly a summation of past releases with a few rarities thrown in. Some releases take the large storage capacity of CD's as reason to forget selectivity, boxing whole catalogues of recordings in giant sets. Recording companies have also taken heart from the big sales of ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of unearthed recordings. An increasing number of boxed sets present material that used to be the province of bootleggers: live shows, alternative takes and unreleased songs, as if recording companies are rushing to release everything they own before the millennium.</p>
        <p>Here, the pop music and jazz critics of The New York Times assess a selection of this year's boxed sets. (Collections previously reviewed in these pages, including those of Hank Williams, John Lennon, Judy Garland and Taj Mahal, are not listed.) The sets average $12 to $16 per disk.</p>

        <p>VARIOUS ARTISTS: 'HAVE A NICE DECADE -- THE 70's POP CULTURE BOX'  (Rhino, seven CD's, R2 72919).  Like a giant K-Tel compilation with an attitude, this shag-carpeted box contains 160 songs, grouped by year, that will spark recognition from anyone who heard Top 40 radio stations in the 1970's; they're interspersed with sound bites like President Gerald Ford's 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon. Gentle pop-folk songwriters land alongside nasal pop belters, velvety rhythm-and-blues harmonizers and country crossovers, and eventually disco arises in tandem with overblown rock anthems. Without any punk included, the compilation reveals a clear color line; as white rockers grew sappier and more pretentious, rhythm-and-blues and funk kept innovating throughout the decade.</p>
