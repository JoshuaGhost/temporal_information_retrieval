        <p>Big conglomerates with bold design ideas continue their steady march across the world, seeming more and more like an implacable cultural army fighting to ensure that everyone from Minsk to Caracas drinks the same soda, wears the same pocket T-shirt and buys the same minimalist lamp. ''It will take 25 years to furnish Russia,'' Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of Ikea, pronounced recently.</p>
        <p>The magazine asked a reporter and a photographer to spend a day in Times Square recently, stopping young foreign tourists at random to see just how far the globalization of design has gone. Here are the results of their highly arbitrary survey. -- SARAH LYALL</p>
        <p>Julia Schneider, 24  Germany  I got my New Balance shoes at home in Munich. I like them  because they are comfortable and I just wanted them. I don't think I have a style. I like long trousers with wide bottoms, and gray and black are my colors. When I came to New York, I thought people would wear different clothes than I wear, but they don't.</p>
        <p>Yusuke Kubota, 23  Japan  I got this jacket at a flea market in Tokyo. I also got the pants and Reeboks in Tokyo. I don't think it's exactly the same here, but in Tokyo brown and black are very popular.</p>
        <p>Alessandra Zeka, 27  Spain  I'm a little fashion crazy. I have a lot of clothes. I bought this coat in pain, and I bought the pants in Canada; in Canada they are very ski-oriented and I thought it was funny to buy them because we don't really ski in Spain. Nowadays, with this highway of information, whatever is fashionable in Rome or Madrid is fashionable everywhere else.</p>
        <p>Adolfo Sarni, 23  Italy  This is a very trendy look. This is a very simple style. I am a very simple person. This is the way I am, and this is the way I want to be. I bought this sweater in Rome, I bought the pants in Milan and I bought these shoes in America.</p>
        <p>Liliane London, 23  Brazil  I'm wearing Levi's and Nike shoes. People wear a lot of American clothes in Rio. Tennis shoes are very popular, especially Nikes. Also Adidas.</p>
        <p>Asa Norin, 18  Sweden  I bought my coat and my cargo pants in Stockholm. And I'm wearing Adidas that I bought in a hip-hop store there. We have five or six hip-hop stores.</p>
        <p>Phyllis Itoka, 21  Liberia  Unless it's a special function, I wear these kinds of clothes in Liberia. It's a little behind, but anything Western is popular. I like this coat because it's kind of European. The clunky loafers are comfortable and cool.</p>
        <p>Bertrand Burgalat, 33  France  My jacket is secondhand; I got it in Paris but the tag inside says it comes from Spain. I bought the cap at Saks in New York and I bought the flight bag in a department store in Japan. When you go to New York, you see the same kind of shops you see in Paris and London, but in Paris, people are into wearing sneakers and like that: all casual.</p>
        <p>Isabel Tapia, 26  Chile  I got my boots in London, my black Levi's in San Juan and my Calvin Klein blouse in Santiago. I would wear this outfit in Santiago, but I would wear black boots. We love the Gap. But in Santiago, it's expensive.</p>
        <p>Rona Aharonson, 19  Israel I bought my jeans at a Levi's store in Israel. In Jerusalem, people wear jeans and a T-shirt and at night they wear black pants and a T-shirt; a lot of it is the same as in New York. People wear a lot of black and gray. I usually wear jeans with a sweater or a sweatshirt on top.</p>
        <p>Simone Muermans, 22  Belgium  I'm wearing dark blue stretch pants that I bought in Belgium in a store with a lot of brands like Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. I got this Diesel jacket in New York. I usually wear more chic shoes, but I'm wearing Nikes today because they're comfortable</p>
        <p>Justin Jackson, 22  England  I bought my jeans in Indonesia, in Bali. They were very cheap. They're a great color. And they're boot legs as well. Got to have boot legs, man. I got these Adidas in Bali as well. They have everything in Bali. But lots of it was surf-dude stuff, and I'm not really into that.</p>
        <p>Ezequiel Sporleder, 25  Argentina  I got the jacket in London, the trousers in New York and the sweater in Argentina. I like these clothes. In the winter I usually wear turtleneck sweaters and jeans and mountain boots. What is the name of my look? I don't know. It's casual.I play the guitar in a rock-and-roll band and all the rock-and-roll people wear the same clothes.</p>
        <p>Alin Boilu, 21  Romania  I don't think I have a style. If I like something I buy it. Romania is a little behind the times, but they see something on TV and they'll wear it. Jeans are completely universal. There's definitely a youth style there that includes a jeans look.</p>
        <p>Angela Su, 24  Taiwan  I bought my clothes in Taiwan. This is how I always dress. More beautiful clothes are not so convenient for living life. Many young people in Taiwan use motorbikes and they wear these kinds of clothes because they're warm and convenient.</p>
