        <p>Joseph Stanley Faulder was 30 minutes from a lethal injection in the Texas death chamber when the United States Supreme Court delayed his execution. Mr. Faulder is a Canadian and his Government had appealed for his life because he was not allowed to seek assistance from the Canadian counsel after his arrest in 1977 on charges of murdering an elderly woman.</p>
        <p>International convention requires that people arrested in a foreign country be given that right; Texas officials said they did not realize that Mr. Faulder, who had a Texas driver's license, was from Canada.</p>
