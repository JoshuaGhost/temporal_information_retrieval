        <p>Rep Barney Frank recalls for House Judiciary Committee the reprimand he received from House in 1990 for using his office to aid a male prostitute who was living in his Capitol Hill house, saying that it brought great shame on him and that such a censure from Congress would be true punishment for Pres Clinton, not something trivial that he could brush off; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Representative Howard Coble, a crusty Republican from North Carolina who favors cheap cigars, stands out among his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for his blunt talk. Today, in a gravelly but somber voice, he spoke of his own anxiety about impeachment in rebutting charges from Democrats that Republicans were acting out of vengeance.</p>
        <p>''I approached this, my friends, with very heavy heart,'' Mr. Coble said when he challenged the contention of Representative Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, that the Republicans were a lynch mob out to get the President. ''I've had knots in my gut all week because of this,'' Mr. Coble said, ''and I'll have knots in my gut next week when we cast votes.''</p>
        <p>The impeachment vote, Mr. Coble said made him anxious. He compared this week's hearings with his vote to endorse the war in the Persian Gulf. Then as now, he said, he knew which decision was right, but that did not mean it was easier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coble's speech in defense of his integrity was addressed as much to his fellow party members as to Mr. Schumer, however, as they have wrestled with their own decisions about whether to vote for impeachment on the floor of the House.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Coble's way of thinking, three ingredients go into every vote: conscience, judgment and the polls. But a representative government, he said, means that conscience and judgment must be a little more equal than public opinion. The polls run against impeachment, but today Mr. Coble urged his party to ignore them.</p>
        <p>''I think most of the time we need to give additional weight to judgment and conscience even if it means conflicting with polling numbers,'' Mr. Coble said.</p>
        <p>For all the knots in his stomach, Mr. Coble's vote will not be any sort of political gamble for him. Mr. Coble, who cultivates the style of relaxed Southern legislator, sneaking out of the committee room to smoke his cigars, won 88.7 percent of the vote in his district, a slice of a textile-producing region that includes Greensboro and that has little love for Mr. Clinton. But the Congressman hopes that Republicans in districts where the President is more popular will vote their conscience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coble's defense of Republicans and pokes at Democrats are usually less grave. The North Carolinian has chided the President's men for clouding his head with murky definitions. Only when he leaves the Capitol to drive home, he says, does the fog clear. ''All of a sudden I'm aware of the definition of sex,'' he said. ''All of a sudden I know what 'is' is.''</p>
        <p>When the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a witness for President Clinton, accused the Republicans of acting out of vengeance, Mr. Coble offered, facetiously, to fight the priest.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Drinan, a former Massachusetts Congressman, took no offense from Mr. Coble's tongue-in-cheek challenge, he said the invocations of conscience are beginning to grate on him. ''You have to vote the Constitution.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coble has only discomfort, not doubts, about his duty under the Constitution. If Mr. Clinton will not resign, the Senate should try him.</p>
        <p>''I don't take it lightly. I don't take it gleefully at all,'' he said. ''It's hard chore for all of us, on that side as well as on this side.''</p>
