        <p>After months of deliberations, Attorney General Janet Reno today put off a decision on whether to ask an independent counsel to investigate the statements of Harold M. Ickes, a former top Presidential aide, about his efforts on behalf of the teamsters union.</p>
        <p>Wavering on the final day of an inquiry limited by statute to 90 days, Ms. Reno invoked a provision of the independent prosecutor law that allows her a one-time 60-day extension that could delay a decision until late January.</p>
        <p>At issue is whether Mr. Ickes, a former White House deputy chief of staff, lied on Sept. 22, 1997, in a deposition to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee complained in its final report earlier this year that Mr. Ickes had misled its investigators about his actions on behalf of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</p>
        <p>Until today, Ms. Reno had seemed to be edging closer toward seeking an independent counsel. The delay brought expressions of quiet relief from White House aides, who reasoned that any decision not explicitly adverse to Mr. Ickes was favorable. Mr. Ickes's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Republicans who have attacked Ms. Reno over her repeated refusal to seek independent counsels in campaign finance cases kept up their criticism today.</p>
        <p>''It should not take her half a year to figure out the obvious,'' said Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who as chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee is one of the President's fiercest critics. ''It has been clear for over two years to everyone across the political spectrum that an independent counsel is needed for the entire campaign finance investigation.''</p>
        <p>Of the options open to Ms. Reno, an extension had seemed the least likely. In a legal brief filed with the panel of appellate court judges that supervises independent counsel matters, Ms. Reno explained why she wanted more time. But the panel placed that filing under seal.</p>
        <p>Her decision followed a meeting today with senior advisers who expressed discordant views on the issue, said law-enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They said Ms. Reno concluded that no decision could be reached without further investigation, although it was unclear what specific factual issues remained open.</p>
        <p>Some officials within the Justice Department expressed dismay over Ms. Reno's indecision. They said the Justice Department has had evidence relating to the case for nearly two years. And, they noted, Ms. Reno has had four months to weigh the issue, beginning with a one-month initial review period, followed by the three-month preliminary investigation that was to have ended today.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they said, the legal issues were familiar. Ms. Reno has decided similar issues in two of the seven cases she has referred to independent counsels. Those investigations center on whether Henry G. Cisneros, the former Housing Secretary, lied to the F.B.I. about the extent of his payments to his former mistress and whether Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary, lied about a departmental decision to deny an Indian casino permit.</p>
        <p>Just last week, Ms. Reno found insufficient evidence for seeking an independent counsel to investigate whether Vice President Al Gore had lied to investigators about his 1996 fund-raising activities.</p>
        <p>With a decision on Mr. Ickes postponed for up to two months, Ms. Reno has one other independent counsel issue to decide before year's end. That case concerns whether Mr. Clinton and his aides violated Federal election law by directing a massive advertising campaign financed with Democratic Party money intended for generic party activities. Election auditors have questioned whether the advertisements should have been financed directly by the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's decision hinges on Mr. Ickes's answer to a single question asked during three days in which he was questioned under oath. Mr. Ickes was asked, ''What did the Administration do regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?'' Mr. Ickes replied: ''Nothing that I know of.''</p>
        <p>That statement appeared to be contradicted by witnesses and documents. The union had been frustrated in efforts to end the labor dispute at a walnut processing plant in Stockton, Calif., and had discussed the issue with Mr. Ickes. White House documents indicated that Mr. Ickes had sought help from Mickey Kantor, then the United States Trade Representative, whom he wanted to intervene with the company. At Mr. Ickes's request, Mr. Kantor phoned Diamond Walnut's president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kantor testified to a Congressional panel earlier this year that he phoned Diamond Walnut, but knowing almost nothing of the facts, simply asked for a ''benign'' status report on the likelihood of a settlement. Mr. Kantor said he did not pressure the company. Diamond Walnut's president said at the same of the hearing that he had not felt threatened, but that he did regard the call as part of a teamster effort ''to bring us to our knees.''</p>
