        <p>Vernon P Loggins letter, commenting on Dec 24 editorial, says public should accept that political leaders have made mistakes since that is the way people generally achieve the maturity, judgment and balance that is prized leaders</p>

        <p>When Larry Flynt entered the political arena, the difficult spectacle in Washington became more bizarre (editorial, Dec. 24). Mr. Flynt claims that the best way to fight hypocrisy is to expose it. And one must reluctantly agree with him. But at what cost?

        <p>When Larry Flynt entered the political arena, the difficult spectacle in Washington became more bizarre (editorial, Dec. 24). Mr. Flynt claims that the best way to fight hypocrisy is to expose it. And one must reluctantly agree with him. But at what cost? I would suggest that what is lacking in our political conversation is the recognition that people make mistakes and that, as every parent knows, mistakes are how people learn.</p>
        <p>If what we want from our political leaders is maturity, judgment and balance, we must expect them to have made mistakes. For without granting that people are fallible and that it is through our fallibilities that we learn, we are destined to be a country bound by the straitjacket of immaturity that prohibits sound judgment and balanced vision.</p>
