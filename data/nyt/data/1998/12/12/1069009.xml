        <p>Unfazed by the House Judiciary Committee's votes today, White House allies continued to lobby undeclared rank-and-file Republicans to oppose impeachment next week on the House floor, and many of the conflicted lawmakers voiced anguish over the impending decision.</p>
        <p>In recent days, Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Congresswoman from New York and Vice-Presidential candidate, has contacted three House Republicans -- Tillie Fowler of Florida, Marge Roukema of New Jersey and Deborah Pryce of Ohio -- to sound out the views of Republican women in Congress and to urge the lawmakers to oppose impeachment.</p>
        <p>''She asked what I was thinking,'' Mrs. Fowler said in an interview, ''and I told her I would vote for impeachment, and she spent the next 15 minutes telling why that was the wrong decision. She said it didn't amount to perjury and it wasn't an impeachable offense. Then she said, a man is a man is a man, and said that other Presidents have done this kind of thing before.''</p>
        <p>The White House acknowledged it was deploying its allies in a full-scale effort to avert impeachment.</p>
        <p>''We're certainly talking to friends around the country about the importance of this matter and how the case that's been made by the committee doesn't reach the standards of impeachment,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said.</p>
        <p>Even as the White House presses for a censure vote, Presidential aides have contacted 45 possibly wavering Republicans to help explain the President's defense.</p>
        <p>But undeclared Republicans continued to wrestle with the decision.</p>
        <p>Representative Jay Dickey of Arkansas, the only Republican to vote against the impeachment inquiry, is still undecided. But the phone calls, E-mail messages and letters to his offices have intensified greatly in the last three days, he said, and they run three-to-one for impeachment.</p>
        <p>More important, Mr. Dickey said, the tone of callers has become much more threatening. ''Before, people were calling to say, 'This is my opinion,' '' he said. ''Now they're saying, 'If you don't impeach him, you'll get a primary challenge.' ''</p>
        <p>Representative Frank Riggs, a California Republican who is retiring this year, is leaning toward voting to impeach on at least the perjury charges. But he said he had pulled back on his position after listening to the debate in the last few days.</p>
        <p>''What's influenced me the most over the last 24 to 48 hours is the notion that the vote to impeach is a vote to remove,'' Mr. Riggs said. ''Prior to that, I was favorable to the view that impeachment is censure. I've raised the bar. That's reinforced the gravity of the situation.''</p>
        <p>The resistance by House Republican leaders to permit a censure vote complicates the White House's flat-out campaign to sway dozens of Republican House moderates.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders have been adamant that the full House will vote next week only on articles of impeachment, not on censure. Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, fears that permitting a censure option would siphon votes away from impeachment. The leadership strategy is intended to pressure as many as three dozen undecided Republicans to vote to impeach the President on at least one count.</p>
        <p>It is conceivable that if impeachment failed, Robert L. Livingston, the new Speaker, would relent and permit a censure vote. But at that point, with the President out of peril, Democrats who wanted censure as an alternative might balk, and Republicans who believed a censure was unconstitutional or a bad precedent would also oppose it.</p>
        <p>The precise dimensions of a censure are still shifting. Several Democrats and Republicans have discussed including a strong condemnation of the President's actions, to be signed by Mr. Clinton, and a fine.</p>
        <p>In an effort to win over Republicans, Mr. Clinton publicly acknowledged for the first time today that he would accept a censure.</p>
        <p>''The public consequences of my actions are in the hands of the American people and their representatives in the Congress,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Should they determine that my errors of word and deed require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart refused to parry with reporters over what censure language the President would accept. ''I'm not going to get into a negotiating position from here at this podium,'' Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
        <p>Unmoved by the White House's defense of the President this week and Mr. Clinton's statement, six undeclared Republicans -- Jack Metcalf of Washington, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, and Bob Franks and Rodney Frelinghuysen, both of New Jersey -- announced today they would vote to impeach the President.</p>
        <p>''It is now clear that the President violated both his oath of office and the oath he took to tell the truth,'' Mr. Frelinghuysen said in a letter to constituents. ''In doing so, Bill Clinton not only committed perjury, he violated the public trust.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diaz-Balart, who an aide said turned down a White House offer on Thursday to speak to the White House counsel, Charles F. C. Ruff, said in a statement, ''Failure to impeach President Clinton would do grave harm to the integrity of the judicial system in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Republican leadership aides said they expected two other undeclared Republicans to announce their support for impeachment in the next few days: Representatives Joe Skeen of New Mexico and Richard H. Baker of Louisiana.  TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE UNDECIDED</p>
