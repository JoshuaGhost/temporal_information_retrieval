        <p>American forces are withdrawing from military bases all over the world, but in many cases what they are leaving behind is dangerous to the local population and environment. Fuels, cleaning fluids, lubricants and other chemicals are leaching into groundwater, and unexploded shells linger on testing grounds long after American soldiers leave.</p>
        <p>Under the Panana Canal Treaties, which require the United States to give up its bases there at the end of next year, Washington must take all ''practicable'' measures to remove hazards. Washington contends it has done that, and is now balking at paying for the cleanup of the bases, whose chemicals are contaminating the groundwater. Panama contends that unexploded bombs have killed 21 people in the last 20 years. The Pentagon says the figure is lower.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, the Pentagon has begun to dispose of waste safely. It is also removing hazardous waste, or paying to do so, at bases in important allied countries such as Germany and Canada. But in most nations base agreements are decades old, signed long before anyone paid attention to environmental damage. Where there is no legal obligation, Pentagon officials say, Congress bars them from spending money for cleanup after the base is closed.  Many Congressmen feel the security provided by an American military base was payment enough.</p>
        <p>This view is not a popular one in countries that lack the money to clean up, or even evaluate, hazards. When the United States pulled out of the Clark and Subic Bay bases in the Philippines beginning in 1991, it left dozens of sites where toxic chemicals and asbestos had been dumped or buried in unsecured landfills. These may now be the cause of disease among people living nearby. Washington has paid the Philippines nothing for cleanup and has released only perfunctory information about the hazards.</p>
        <p>New laws are needed to provide the Pentagon with funds to repair its environmental damage and develop new technologies for sweeping up live bombs. The risks do not stop at the border, and neither should American accountability.</p>
