        <p>Two former owners of a federally subsidized housing complex in Brooklyn and one of their employees were arrested yesterday and charged with stealing more than $2 million in Federal money that was intended for the complex's maintenance.</p>
        <p>Instead of using the money to operate and upgrade the complex, Noble Drew Ali Plaza in Brownsville, which houses low-income residents, the men are accused of illegally diverting the money to their other businesses or using it for personal expenses, no-show jobs for relatives and contributions to religious organizations and political campaigns, Federal prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>While the suspects owned the complex from 1989 to 1996, the prosecutors said, it received more than 1,000 building code violations for perilous and unsanitary conditions, including sewage backups, rodent and insect infestation and, at one point, carbon monoxide fumes from a boiler's cracked  flue that forced the evacuation of two elderly residents. The complex comprises five buildings of nearly 400 apartments.</p>
        <p>The extensive disrepair that the authorities described under the defendants' ownership was part of a history of problems that had plagued the complex after it was built in a severely deteriorated neighborhood 25 years ago in the hope that it would provide desperately needed housing for the poor.</p>
        <p>Those charged in an indictment made public yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn were Leon Mochkin, 74, and Chaim Fischman, 73, two of the principals of Linden Realty Associates, which owned the complex during the seven years that the  charges cover, and Steven Katz, 36, who was the controller at Linden.</p>
        <p>The three men, all Brooklyn residents, pleaded not guilty at an arraignment before Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak, who released Mr. Mochkin on a $500,000 bond and the other two on bonds of $250,000 each.</p>
        <p>As the suspects left the courthouse, Mr. Mochkin's lawyer, Norman Rosen, said, ''My client's innocence will be clearly established in the due course of these proceedings.'' The lawyers for Mr. Fischman and Mr. Katz, who is Mr. Fischman's son-in-law, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The charges were the latest arising from a nationwide effort by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to combat fraud and abuse in the subsidy programs it administers. Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York,  whose office is prosecuting the case, said that ''through their diversion of substantial Federal funds'' intended for badly needed low-income housing, the defendants ''subverted the worthy designs of this program for their own benefit.''</p>
        <p>The indictment charges all three men with stealing and conspiring to steal Federal money, each charge punishable by as much as five years in prison. Mr. Fischman is also charged with money laundering, which is punishable by as much as 20 years in prison. The laundering charge stems from what the authorities contend was a scheme to conceal the diversion of nearly half a million dollars of the stolen housing money to a jewelry business that Mr. Fischman owned.</p>
        <p>Other illegal activities charged in the indictment include the transfer of $4,000 to a synagogue with which Mr. Mochkin was affiliated and payments to other religious organizations, including $258 to repair a Torah, a sacred Jewish scroll.</p>
        <p>The men are also charged with using the Federal housing money for personal home-mortgage and other payments and for making contributions in 1994 -- $500 to a fund-raising organization for George E. Pataki's campaign for governor and $250 to a similar group for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Investigators said there was no indication that Mr. Pataki, Mr. D'Amato or any of their fund-raisers knew that the contributions were made with the stolen money.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors, Ilene Jaroslaw and Michael J. Goldberger, assistant United States attorneys in Brooklyn, said that in 1996 the Government took title to Noble Drew Ali Plaza and turned it over to a nonprofit group.</p>
        <p>When Linden Realty became the owner in 1989, many of the apartments were vacant and drug-dealing was rampant in the complex. Community leaders said later that the company hired a private security company that forced the dealers out, after which Linden Realty invested money in improving the buildings.</p>
