        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article ''Scientists Seek a New Movie Role'' on Dec. 1 said that scientists accounted for a mere 2 percent of characters in prime-time dramas and then concluded that doctors were not scientists. Anyone who has been a premed student will assure you that doctors are scientists. In fact, a common complaint among medical students is the intense focus on the sciences to the exclusion of the arts. Perhaps viewers have a fascination with hospital dramas like ''E.R.'' because they portray these scientists as humans with foibles, fears, love lives and children they cherish. There is no reason not to include more science on television.  But as with chocolate milk and presweetened, high-fiber cereals, maybe producers have to sneak in the science, so the audience won't know it's learning.</p>
