        <p>After months of negotiating, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France and Hoechst A.G. of Germany said yesterday that they would combine their pharmaceutical and agricultural units into a new company as the first step of a merger.</p>
        <p>With the agreement, Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst propel themselves to the top of two industries. Their new company, Aventis, which will be equally owned by Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, will be the world's No. 2 pharmaceutical maker behind Merck &amp; Company and the globe's top seller of agricultural products.</p>
        <p>Few drug companies can match Aventis in size. The company, which will be based in Strasbourg, France, should have annual sales of $20 billion -- well ahead of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson &amp; Johnson --  employ 95,000 people and boast an annual operating profit of $3.8 billion.</p>
        <p>''This deal is all about accelerating the top line,'' said Peter McDougall, a pharmaceutical analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London. ''Everyone has pointed out that Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc were never very successful in the past. Well, they didn't have critical mass to compete. They do now.''</p>
        <p>Yet the birth of Aventis, which had been widely anticipated by analysts and investors for months, did not cause wide celebration within the pharmaceutical industry. Investors in Europe and the United States quickly sold shares in both stocks. Some took profits while others sold because they were unsure about Aventis's future.</p>
        <p>Hoechst's shares closed yesterday in Frankfurt at 68.1 marks, down 5.5 percent. Rhone-Poulenc's stock closed in Paris at 263.4 francs, off 7 percent. The carnage was not as severe in the United States. Hoechst's American depository receipts closed yesterday at $41, off 2.4 percent, while Rhone-Poulenc's drooped 5.1 percent, to $47.4375.</p>
        <p>The courtship of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, which had become one of the longest merger negotiations in recent memory, has yet to be completed. According to the companies' statement yesterday, they will merge the remainder of their operations within the next two to three years, after each has had time to divest itself of its chemical operations and other side businesses. The Aventis transaction is expected to close by the middle of next year.</p>
        <p>The companies had wrestled for weeks with how to construct a merger of equals that would appease shareholders and pass the scrutiny of European regulators. The French Government had frowned heavily on Rhone-Poulenc's assets falling under German control, while Hoechst executives feared their shareholders would balk at any deal that didn't give them a controlling interest.</p>
        <p>Analysts said yesterday that executives from both companies believed they had struck a working middle ground. Hoechst now has three years to sell off its assets, bringing it closer to Rhone-Poulenc's size. By basing the company in France, executives hope to appease any concerns the French government could raise. France also offered a better tax structure than Germany.</p>
        <p>In fact, Aventis appears to be a boon for the French. Analysts pointed out yesterday that while Rhone-Poulenc should contribute only 45 percent of Aventis's total sales, it has a 50 percent stake in the company's profits.</p>
        <p>''Maybe Rhone-Poulenc's assets have not been valued properly,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner with Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical investment research firm in New York. ''But regardless, for Rhone-Poulenc, it is a much better deal.''</p>
        <p>Management responsibilities appear to be divided up equally between the two companies. Jurgen Dormann, Hoechst's chief executive, will serve as the chairman of Aventis, while Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's chief, will serve as vice chairman. Richard J. Markham, Hoechst's top pharmaceutical executive, will head the drug business. Alain Godard, the head of Rhone-Poulenc's crop-protection operation, will steer the agrochemicals division.</p>
        <p>Despite the excitement from the agreement, most analysts remained unimpressed with the deal. With virtually every positive point the Aventis executives mentioned, analysts noted a caveat attached.</p>
        <p>Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc executives boasted yesterday that Aventis could create $1.2 billion in savings during the next three years, with 60 percent of it coming from the company's pharmaceutical operations.</p>
        <p>Analysts said yesterday that some of the savings could come from laying off 10 percent of the company's 95,000 employees, but that would be difficult. Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst are already divesting themselves of several businesses, and any further job reductions could anger the French and German Governments.</p>
        <p>Of particular concern among analysts is the weak presence in the United States of the businesses that will make up Aventis. Even though the company will be the world's second-largest drug seller, it will rank 12th in the United States, far below companies with half its sales. As if expecting this criticism, Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc executives noted that Aventis would employ 3,400 sales representatives in the United States, with more soon to be hired. But that hardly appeased the critics.</p>
        <p>''Pfizer has 5,500 salespeople in the United States,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''That's a lot more than Aventis. But even if Aventis had 5,500 salespeople,  they would still have a tough time. They would still be selling old products. This is about quality, not quanity.''</p>
