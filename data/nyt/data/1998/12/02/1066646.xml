        <p>As oncologists we agree that it is time for Americans to talk more openly about end-of-life issues.

        <p>Re ''Going Beyond Debate Over Assisted Suicide'' (letters, Nov. 29):</p>
        <p>As oncologists we agree that it is time for Americans to talk more openly about end-of-life issues. However, it is disgraceful to suggest that the recently televised assisted suicide performed by Dr. Jack Kevorkian will lead to a more coherent and comprehensive examination of these complicated legal, moral and ethical issues.</p>
        <p>This country has a large cadre of health care professionals who devote their entire careers to caring for the terminally ill. It is safe to say that Dr. Kevorkian is not one of them.</p>
        <p>He has spent his professional career in the field of pathology. Thus his ''patients'' were already dead when he met them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kevorkian has no experience in diagnosing a terminal illness, conveying this to a patient and then caring for the patient through a long and ultimately fatal illness.</p>
        <p>To do so requires a skill and compassion that Dr. Kevorkian sadly lacks.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL GOLDSTEIN, M.D.  LIDIA SHAPIRA, M.D.  Brookline, Mass., Nov. 30, 1998</p>
