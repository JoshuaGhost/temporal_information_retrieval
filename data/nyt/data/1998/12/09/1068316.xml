        <p>A Yale University law professor who is a student of impeachment procedures suggested today that even if the House of Representatives voted this year to impeach Bill Clinton, the House that takes office in January would have to cast at least one more vote on the matter.</p>
        <p>The suggestion by the professor, Bruce Ackerman, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times and in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, added a complication to the maneuvering.

        <p>A Yale University law professor who is a student of impeachment procedures suggested today that even if the House of Representatives voted this year to impeach Bill Clinton, the House that takes office in January would have to cast at least one more vote on the matter.</p>
        <p>The suggestion by the professor, Bruce Ackerman, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times and in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, added a complication to the maneuvering. Republicans were unimpressed, but Democrats said that the argument bolstered their case that the lame-duck House should not vote for impeachment.</p>
        <p>In a memorandum to the Judiciary Committee, Elizabeth B. Bazan of the American Law Division of the Library of Congress wrote that the  precedents indicated that a new vote would not be necessary on impeachment itself but that the House would probably have to vote in January to select members to prosecute the case in a Senate trial.</p>
        <p>Thomas E. Mann, director of Government studies at the Brookings Institution and an expert on Congress, said that even a vote on appointing managers, as the prosecutors are called, could provide an opportunity for the new House to review the case and decide not to try to remove the President from office.</p>
        <p>Professor Ackerman made the case that a bill of impeachment was no different from a piece of legislation passed by the House that would die at the end of the 105th Congress if the Senate had not acted.</p>
        <p>The Library of Congress study took issue with that analysis. Ms. Bazan found examples of impeachment cases involving Federal judges that had been carried over from one Congress to the next. But she also found that in each instance, most recently in the case of Judge Alcee L. Hastings in 1988 and 1989, the House voted anew to appoint managers to prosecute the case in the Senate.</p>
