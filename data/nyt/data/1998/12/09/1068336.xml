        <p>American proposals for a broad new strategic concept for NATO, to counter the global threat from chemical, nuclear and biological weapons, received quizzical responses today from European allies.</p>
        <p>Many allies also resisted American suggestions that the alliance could intervene in regional crises even if it did not have explicit authority from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright told other Foreign Ministers at a meeting in the NATO headquarters here that it was hogwash to suggest that possible new missions for the alliance like building up intelligence on weapons of mass destruction held by countries outside the NATO area might contradict the original self-defense goals of the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Albright was not suggesting, other officials who heard her remarks said, that NATO extend its area of operations to Iraq or Iran or take on the problem of development of nuclear weapons by North Korea, for example. ''I made very clear,'' she said later, ''that we are not trying to get NATO to go global.''</p>
        <p>But the American initiative on weapons of mass destruction, an assertive post-cold-war strategy for an alliance whose primary mission has always been to defend its members' territory, raised questions nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France said today that he was concerned that if NATO broadened its mission ''we would run the risk of diluting the alliance and dividing the allies, which, of course, should not happen.''</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany said it would be a mistake to make a rule out of the exception that the allies made this fall in Kosovo. NATO threatened bombing to halt government attacks against ethnic Albanian civilians in the Kosovo province of Serbia, even though the United Nations Security Council had not explicitly authorized military action.</p>
        <p>Beyond self-defense, France and Germany insisted, NATO missions should have Security Council approval. Mrs. Albright said the United States view was that NATO should  address the issue case by case.</p>
        <p>But, she agreed, ''NATO will in all cases act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton has invited allied leaders to a summit meeting in April in Washington to welcome Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary as new members, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the alliance and to approve a new post-cold-war strategy for the new total of 19 members.</p>
        <p>The allies agreed that a new strategic concept would take many more intensive discussions.</p>
        <p>Their primary concern remains European security, guaranteed by the United States as leader of the alliance.</p>
        <p>Today all the allies welcomed an agreement by Britain and France last week that European countries should have the means to act militarily on their own trouble-prone continent and to take military action, even when the United States or other allies do not want troops involved.</p>
        <p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain, which has long argued that NATO provides all the defense that Europe needs, conceded that in trouble spots like Bosnia or Kosovo, Europeans might want to act on their own before regional insecurity developed into a threat to their own territorial integrity.</p>
