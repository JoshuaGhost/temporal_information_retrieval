        <p>A power failure struck San Francisco at the rush hour this morning, cutting service to more than a million people, leaving train commuters stranded under San Francisco Bay, stalling trolleys and electric buses in the streets and forcing businesses, some schools and the Pacific Stock Exchange to shut down.</p>
        <p>The power went out about 8:15 A.M., when a construction crew at a transmission station in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, failed to remove a pipe at the right time, said Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of the PG&amp;E Corporation. That ''simple, human error'' tripped a protective device that shut down an entire system -- three major power lines -- for more than six hours.</p>

        <p>A power failure struck San Francisco at the rush hour this morning, cutting service to more than a million people, leaving train commuters stranded under San Francisco Bay, stalling trolleys and electric buses in the streets and forcing businesses, some schools and the Pacific Stock Exchange to shut down.</p>
        <p>The power went out about 8:15 A.M., when a construction crew at a transmission station in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, failed to remove a pipe at the right time, said Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of the PG&amp;E Corporation. That ''simple, human error'' tripped a protective device that shut down an entire system -- three major power lines -- for more than six hours.</p>
        <p>A 75-year-old woman crossing a city street was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer in a hit-and-run accident that occurred shortly after the power failure began. But Dewayne Tully, a Police Department spokesman, said the police could not say whether the lack of street lights caused the accident.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to say whether this was caused by the power outage,'' Mr. Tully said. ''Traffic was moving very slowly. But drivers were probably watching each other more than pedestrians. And with all the confusion, it's likely that the power outage was a contributing factor.''</p>
        <p>The power failure trapped hundreds of people in elevators, stranded subway and train passengers for more than an hour. Most hospitals canceled elective surgeries, and many banks, automated teller machines and department stores were closed.</p>
        <p>No looting or other major accidents were reported. But the power failure, which affected most of San Francisco and parts of San Mateo County, caused confusion for hundreds of thousands of people, forcing drivers back to the polite days of the four-way stop, shutting down much of the commuter transit system and diverting planes headed to San Francisco in the first hour of the emergency to San Jose, Oakland, St. Louis, Seattle and Phoenix.</p>
        <p>By noon, power in San Francisco was slowly being restored, police officers were stationed at major traffic stops and Mayor Willie Brown had announced that ''people should just carry on life as they did before.''</p>
        <p>But many people decided not to wait until the power was restored, and turned around and went home. By midday, when electricity had been restored to about two-thirds of San Francisco, traffic heading out of the city was as heavy as it is in the 5 o'clock rush hour.</p>
        <p>Those who did not go home simply stood around outside despite the 50-degree weather. Downtown office workers lined the streets, smoking, drinking coffee and talking on cellular phones.</p>
        <p>''Our building is mostly out, and the day is shot,'' said Reed Jones, an independent financial analyst who works on Market Street, the main street of the financial district, as he waited in line. ''We could use the phones, but not the computers. We're worried that when the power comes back on, if the computers are on, they'll fry.''</p>
        <p>PG&amp;E officials said power was restored at 2:05 P.M., but radio news stations later reported receiving complaints from people who said they still had no electricity.</p>
        <p>Maria and Peter Krauss, tourists on their second honeymoon, waited in a big crowd in front of Macy's in Union Square for the store to open this afternoon. ''We're from Germany,'' Mrs. Krauss said. ''We think this is so funny. Everybody is very polite and orderly.''</p>
        <p>''We were in Nordstrom's and the clerks were ringing up purchases with calculators,'' Mr. Krauss said. ''I think that's a very sophisticated approach to a crisis.''</p>
