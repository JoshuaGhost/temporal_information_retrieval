        <p>The office building used by District Council 37 in lower Manhattan has seven elevators -- six public, one private. Most serve the rank and file, taking union members to the rooms where they can file grievances, attend night classes and get information about dental plans. The private elevator, until recently, served the select guests and allies of a union official named Albert A. Diop.</p>
        <p>It carried Mr. Diop and his friends to a penthouse that tops the 10-story building. For several years, union officials and investigators now say, Mr. Diop entertained and often slept there, paying the rent out of the dues of the 22,000 clerical workers in the local that he oversees. In the union's democratic setting, Mr. Diop's penthouse symbolized for some the arrogance of power.</p>
        <p>But the penthouse also reflects the elevated position that Mr. Diop holds in the hierarchy of District Council 37, the powerful umbrella organization that unites 56 local unions and 120,000 municipal employees. Although he often cedes the limelight to more flamboyant colleagues, union officials said, Mr. Diop has long been a dominant figure, the man with considerable influence over the council's longtime executive director, Stanley Hill.</p>
        <p>Now, with the district council mired in a broad criminal investigation -- the allegations range from penny-ante corruption to high-stakes ballot fraud -- prosecutors are piecing together the quiet, somewhat extravagant world of Al Diop. That inquiry is focusing on his use of union money for the penthouse, with its laundry and exercise rooms, and on his frequent travels, which included a weeklong trip to Zimbabwe in the late 1980's with several associates and a trip last summer to a union convention in Hawaii. For that excursion, union officials said, he brought along about 300 members, friends and supporters.</p>
        <p>Investigators are also examining the circumstances surrounding the tainted 1996 ratification of the council's five-year city contract, which included an unpopular two-year pay freeze. Witnesses have told investigators that most of the thousands of bogus ballots believed to have been used to tamper with the vote were cast in one local, leaving the official tally to read 10,002 votes for ratification and 2,265 against.</p>
        <p>That local was Clerical-Administrative Employees Local 1549; its president is Mr. Diop. Among the questions being investigated is whether Mr. Diop had any role in ordering the district council's print shop to make up the extra Local 1549 ballots that are believed to have been used to rig the vote, lawyers familiar with the investigation said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop declined to be interviewed yesterday. Instead, he issued a statement through a spokeswoman: ''I decline to comment on the laundry list of items to respond to on my career of over 30 years at the union for a column to appear in tomorrow's paper. It is extremely unfair to be asked at the last minute to respond to allegations based on rumors, innuendo and slander by political enemies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop has consistently refused to comment since the allegations of widespread union corruption surfaced several weeks ago. Instead, he has left others to defend him, including Mr. Hill, who was forced last week to take an unpaid leave by the district council's parent union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which assumed control of the council.</p>
        <p>''He said he had no knowledge of it,'' Mr. Hill said recently, referring to Mr. Diop and the suspected ballot tampering. ''The track record of 1549 has been incredibly impeccable.''</p>
        <p>The record of Local 1549 has also been one of doing things in big ways.  It frequently sent the largest contingent to union conferences, whether they were held in Atlantic City or Waikiki. It also often influenced the decisions of the district council, officials said, thanks to a mathematical reality: its 22,000 members represent one-fifth of the council's total membership, and its support was essential to Mr. Hill.</p>
        <p>Charles Ensley, the president of the 14,000-member social workers' local and a frequent critic of the district council's leadership, provided what he described as a telling example. In 1991, he said, he argued against holding an executive board retreat in the Bahamas because it might anger union members and produce embarrassing publicity -- at a time when 20,000 members faced layoffs. It was Mr. Diop, he said, who persuaded Mr. Hill and the rest of the board to approve the retreat.</p>
        <p>''Diop has always been perceived as the power behind the throne,'' Mr. Ensley said. ''He controls the patronage. Nobody gets anything in the district council without his say.''</p>
        <p>At 63, Mr. Diop has dedicated most of his life to the union, serving for the last 28 years as the president of Local 1549, whose clerical members earn an average of $25,000 a year. Mr. Diop earned $191,000 as president last year, and $18,400 more as a board member of the parent union. During his tenure, he has been praised for tripling his membership, backing efforts to integrate the union and choosing his allies well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill and Mr. Diop have been close for decades. When Mr. Hill began as a low-level employee at the district council in 1971, he was assigned to handle the grievances and requests from the members of Local 1549, for many years the council's largest local. And when Mr. Hill became executive director, Local 1549, with the guidance of Mr. Diop, became his power base.</p>
        <p>''When people ask questions about how does Hill survive all these years, the core of his support was 1549,'' Stanley Aronowitz, a labor relations expert at City University, said. ''Local 1549 was so big that all Stanley had to do was pick up the support of a few other locals and he could stay in power.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the Hill-Diop pact also served Mr. Diop's needs. ''He's very smart,'' Victor Gotbaum, Mr. Hill's predecessor as head of the council, said. ''He's nicknamed 'The Fox.' ''</p>
        <p>That nickname may also be attributed to Mr. Diop's stealthy manner. A high-ranking city official who has participated in union negotiations said Mr. Diop almost never attended the negotiating sessions, relying instead on the bargaining skills of an associate or Mr. Hill's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop's laid-back manner, however, is not always consistent with the decisions he makes in spending the local's money. For example, when the union bought the office building at 125 Barclay Street in 1983, Mr. Gotbaum was so uncomfortable with the penthouse that he never used it. He said he feared the question that would naturally arise from the rank and file, ''What the hell is a labor leader doing with a luxury apartment?''</p>
        <p>The district council chose instead to rent the space to a businessman. But sometime after Mr. Hill succeeded Mr. Gotbaum in 1986, officials said, Mr. Diop made it clear that he wanted to rent the space.</p>
        <p>Permission was granted, and soon the penthouse at the top of a union building was the site of private parties, union officials said, its rent paid by Mr. Diop's local. Mr. Hill has said people slept in the penthouse only on occasion; others said Mr. Diop stayed there regularly until last year, when word of the penthouse began to spread. Although the monthly rent for the penthouse could not be learned, it was described as a two-level apartment with bedrooms and a living room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop's travel habits also prompted both envy and disgust among his union colleagues. They say the district council often relied on Local 1549 to arrange the evening entertainment so essential to the success of business conferences.</p>
        <p>''You can't imagine what a travel operation this man had,'' said one union official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''He had his own list of bands and his own list of entertainers.''</p>
        <p>That official and others said Mr. Diop and his entourage traveled often, and usually in first-class style. In addition to the almost routine trips to Atlantic City and to the Catskills for union functions, international union gatherings took them to Switzerland, to Zimbabwe, to Copenhagen, to Tokyo.</p>
        <p>''The membership wasn't aware of his whereabouts all the time and neither was the council's staff,'' said John H. Lewis, a labor relations specialist in the legal department who was assistant director of the clerical division. ''We knew he was out of town, but for all we knew, he could have been in Washington at an executive board meeting or he could have been in Switzerland.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diop's latest travel extravaganza came last August, when his local flew him and 300 members to the parent union's convention in Hawaii. Union members said he and his tight circle usually fly first class, while members fly economy class.</p>
        <p>One union member who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Mr. Diop and other officials decided who would go on the Hawaii trip and other excursions to reward allies and buy off potential opponents. With such techniques, the member said, Mr. Diop has maintained control, and his election slate rarely faces opposition.</p>
        <p>''For travel, nothing was spared,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''For parties, nothing was spared. Was the money put to its best use all the time? The answer is no.''</p>
