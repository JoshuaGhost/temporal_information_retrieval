        <p>When Eddy and Ivette Alvarez went into business together almost five years ago, they had skills: Mr. Alvarez knew how to make plaster statues, and Mrs. Alvarez knew how to paint them.</p>
        <p>They also had a product: a small copy of the Infant of Prague, the statue of the baby Jesus that some believe works miracles.</p>
        <p>But they did not have money, at least not enough to buy plaster. Even if they had had the know-how to borrow from a bank, they had nothing to put up as collateral.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. and Mrs. Alvarez, who met a decade ago while working at a figurine factory, have a workshop of their own in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they and five employees turn out thousands of plaster statues of everything from coiled cobras to Indian chiefs, along with dozens of different religious figures. They can do so, Mrs. Alvarez said, thanks to several small loans they have received from an organization called Accion New York, based in Williamsburg.</p>
        <p>Accion makes tiny loans -- as little as $1,000 -- to impoverished entrepreneurs including seamstresses, hairdressers, grocers and bakers, many of them in the Spanish-speaking enclave in Williamsburg. By helping people to become self-employed, Accion hopes to help not just individuals, but also a whole community.</p>
        <p>This kind of loan program is known as microcredit, and it has helped combat poverty in developing countries like India and Ecuador, according to the World Bank. While variations of the concept have occasionally been tried, with limited success, in developed countries, microcredit is now winning a growing number of converts in the United States, especially in New York. Philanthropists who have made their fortunes from Wall Street are particularly attracted to the idea of giving ''a hand up, not a handout'' to budding entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>Among the efforts they are supporting is the first significant foray into the United States by Grameen Bank, which started the microcredit movement two decades ago in Bangladesh. Grameen, which has opened a mutual fund to raise money from Americans, has just signed contracts to manage its first two programs in the United States, in Harlem and Tulsa, Okla.</p>
        <p>But as Accion and other groups like it have found, it is not so simple to adapt a program designed for Bangladeshi villages to the very different cultural and economic situation in the United States. Although there are a lot of microcredit programs in America -- as many as 300, by one count -- only a few have made more than a handful of loans.</p>
        <p>Even programs like Accion, the largest in New York City, are struggling to get big enough to make a real difference. Lenders have sometimes had trouble reaching potential clients, and it is also much harder to keep tabs on a borrower in New York City than in a rural village.</p>
        <p>''We haven't been able to grow as fast as we want,'' said Robin A. E. Ratcliffe, a vice president of Accion International, which runs several programs in the United States based on its much larger program in Latin America. ''Some people thought that you could take that model, go clunk and make it work here,'' she said, ''but that is not our experience.''</p>
        <p>In principle, microcredit programs are simple. Borrowers take out very small, very short-term loans; if they repay the loans on time, they become eligible for bigger ones. The loans, which might be as small as $5 in Africa but in the United States tend to start at $500 or $1,000, might help a villager buy chickens to start an egg business, or a city dweller to buy vegetables to sell on a street corner.</p>
        <p>Many programs use what is known as peer lending, in which first-time borrowers form a group that takes responsibility for the repayment of all its members' loans.</p>
        <p>In fact, few people default. At Accion International, for example, the default rate is just above 2 percent. Because almost all the money gets repaid, it can be reused, making microcredit programs very cost-effective, proponents say. Some programs even make enough money from their lending to cover their costs.</p>
        <p>The concept is being promoted by the Clinton Administration, and more than a thousand people working in the field met late last month in Manhattan at the second annual ''summit meeting'' on the movement.</p>
        <p>It has also been embraced on Wall Street, which is becoming a source of both expertise and financial backing. Terri Ludwig, the president of Accion New York, is a former executive at Credit Suisse First Boston, the big investment bank; her boss, Michael Chu, who runs Accion International, is a former limited partner in the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The Bankers Trust Corporation, which caters to companies and wealthy individuals, has set up a fund that last month made its first loans to microcredit lenders, including Accion New York. The $500,000 in the fund came from the bank and some of its well-to-do customers.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in the old social system,'' said Scott Reardon, a venture capitalist and chairman of the Bankers Trust fund. ''The reason I want to do this is that it allows me and my family to contribute in a way I am highly confident will work.''</p>
        <p>Some of the success stories are striking. When Carlos Aldana came to the United States from Ibague, Colombia, 11 years ago, he worked at three jobs, including delivering packages, he said recently through a translator. His first $1,000 loan from Accion helped him buy a van to make deliveries; later, larger loans helped him buy a tiny cafe in Corona, Queens, and to expand the production of corn cakes known as arepas.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Aldana employs 11 workers in his arepa factory, where with the help of some small machines they turn out 7,000 corn cakes a day, he said. His latest $15,000 loan helped him buy equipment that should let him double production of the arepas, which he sells to supermarkets and bodegas for $1.50 for package of five.</p>
        <p>The factory runs 24 hours a day, and Mr. Aldana is there at least 15 of those hours, he said. His wife and two youngest children, age 8 and 6, are often there, too; his eldest son, who is 18, is a student at the University of Colombia in Bogota.</p>
        <p>''It's very important, what Accion does,'' Mr. Aldana said. ''For banks, it's very hard to see small-business men -- they are too strong with their rules and regulations.''</p>
        <p>Banks are generally not in the business of writing tiny loans, because they are as expensive to process -- and far less profitable -- than larger loans. And bankers can be reluctant to base their lending on a borrower's character, rather than collateral. Major banks generally do not make business loans for less than $25,000.</p>
        <p>Some Asian and Caribbean immigrants raise money for their businesses through so-called lending circles. Members of these circles agree to contribute a set amount each month into a pot, and each month a different member gets to use all the money in the pot. Immigrants from Korea, Vietnam, Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbados and Ethiopia all have similar programs, said Ivan Light, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied informal credit networks.</p>
        <p>But many would-be entrepreneurs turn to loan sharks. Adalberto Espinal, who runs a bodega in Williamsburg, said loan sharks charge $200 a month on a $1,000 loan -- an interest rate of 140 percent a year. He turned instead to Accion to borrow so that he could keep the store shelves well stocked; he used up his $14,000 savings to make a down payment on the store, which the previous owner lost because of his heavy debts to loan sharks.</p>
        <p>Accion charges 16 percent a year, which is more than an established business might pay, but less than many Americans pay on their credit cards. In 1997, the New York program had 344 active borrowers who took out $1.4 million in loans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ludwig, the program's chief executive, says she thinks that it should be far larger. ''In New York City, 26 percent of the population is living in poverty,'' she said. A program like hers has the potential, she said, ''to make an impact in an economically viable way, to get at the root of the problem.''</p>
        <p>But there are challenges to running a program in New York, challenges that are not faced by lenders in rural villages. Getting the word out about the program is difficult; many potential borrowers, especially women, do not think of the baby-sitting or cleaning they do to make a little extra cash as a formal business, Ms. Ludwig said. So she is trying to work with organizations like churches and job-training programs that might send borrowers her way.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the borrowers she has are not all within walking distance, as they might be in a developing country; she has assigned one person to do most of the on-site inspections of potential borrowers' businesses, so that her two loan officers do not spend all their time on the subway.</p>
        <p>And because people are more mobile here, they seem to find it a little easier to walk away from their loans.  Accion New York, for example, has had the most trouble with its loans to taxi and livery drivers because they move around so much, said Evelyn Lassalle, one of the loan officers.</p>
        <p>Accion is also trying to use American methods to its advantage. Ms Ludwig's former colleagues on Wall Street have donated computers, which should make loans easier to analyze. Last year, the program became the first microcredit organization to sell a package of loans to an investor, a transaction that is common on Wall Street but almost unknown elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''We need to reinvent the whole approach so as to develop a new U.S. model,'' said Mr. Chu, the president of Accion International.</p>
        <p>But the founders of the microcredit movement worry that Americans have already tampered too much with the original model. That is one of the reasons Grameen has decided to manage some programs here, said Alex Counts, director of the Grameen Foundation in Washington.</p>
        <p>For one thing, some American programs -- though not Accion -- tend to emphasize formal training over lending, Mr. Counts said. ''It's very typical, and close to universal, to require 10 weeks of business training before you can talk about getting a loan,'' he said. ''People who are running a business or are serious about starting one don't have time for that.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Alvarez certainly does not. She and her husband used to work until 3 in the morning making statues, she said; now that they have hired employees, they have to work only from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.</p>
        <p>But she is not complaining. She and her husband are now starting to save to buy a house, she said. ''And we started with zip.''</p>
