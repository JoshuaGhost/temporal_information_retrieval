        <p>Philip M Boffey Editorial Observer column notes first year of Chinese control of Hong Kong has not led to loss of freedom for average citizen; sees vigilance of Hong Kong activists and citizens in defense of their freedoms as key factor; sees danger that Hong Kong, eager to avoid confrontation, will shackle itself without any prodding from China (M)</p>

        <p>This dynamic financial center has been under Chinese control for a year now. There are new laws and a governing structure that lay the groundwork for future repression should the leadership in Beijing choose to get nasty. But for now virtually none of the fears voiced at the time of transition from British rule have come to pass.</p>
        <p>There have been no crackdowns on dissidents and no tanks or army patrols in the streets. The press is more cautious and the courts ducked a case involving mainland interests. But there has been no overt censorship, no meddling in the courts or the civil service, no interference with the city's rambunctious free markets. There is distress over a plummeting economy, a result of the Asian economic crisis rather than the takeover by China. But from all the casual observer can see, the average citizen has just as much freedom now as under the British.</p>

        <p>This dynamic financial center has been under Chinese control for a year now. There are new laws and a governing structure that lay the groundwork for future repression should the leadership in Beijing choose to get nasty. But for now virtually none of the fears voiced at the time of transition from British rule have come to pass.</p>
        <p>There have been no crackdowns on dissidents and no tanks or army patrols in the streets. The press is more cautious and the courts ducked a case involving mainland interests. But there has been no overt censorship, no meddling in the courts or the civil service, no interference with the city's rambunctious free markets. There is distress over a plummeting economy, a result of the Asian economic crisis rather than the takeover by China. But from all the casual observer can see, the average citizen has just as much freedom now as under the British.</p>
        <p>Government officials, businessmen, diplomats from the West and human rights activists all voice relief that the first year of transition has gone so smoothly. Human Rights Watch, whose office some thought might be closed down because of its persistent criticism of repression in mainland China, has instead found itself invited to official government parties and showcase events.</p>
        <p>Just why China has kept hands off is a matter of speculation. Some say President Jiang Zemin has been so intent on securing his own power that he has little stomach for meddling in Hong Kong, or that he wants to improve relations with the West and hence can't look totalitarian, or that he hopes to persuade Taiwan to rejoin the mainland by showing, through the experience of Hong Kong, just how painless that transition can be. The more cynical say China has done such a good job of rigging the governmental structure and installing its sympathizers in power that it has no need to take overt action. Others say China never intended to interfere with such a valuable center of trade and finance.</p>
        <p>But surely one major factor in the benign turn of events is the vigilance of Hong Kong activists and citizens in defense of their freedoms. Voters turned out in surprising numbers for the recent legislative elections and gave heavy support to democratically oriented candidates. Activists continue to demonstrate at the drop of a cause, sometimes by the thousands or even tens of thousands. The more courageous elements of the press are quick to protest any perceived sellout of historical freedoms.</p>
        <p>That will be an important trait in the years ahead, for there have been some worrisome developments. The legislature has been structured in such a way that democratically elected candidates will not be able to gain dominance for at least 10 years. Laws have been passed that make it easier for the Government to crack down on activists on national security grounds, and a pending proposal would prohibit acts of treason, secession and subversion against China in language so sweeping that political dissent and media coverage of it might be in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>The more immediate danger is that Hong Kong, eager to avoid confrontation, will shackle itself without any prodding from Beijing. The criminal justice system is accused of ducking when asked to prosecute an agency of the mainland Government and a individual with strong mainland ties. Many Chinese-language newspapers, which once routinely referred to the Tiananmen Square ''massacre,'' have now downgraded it to an ''incident'' or ''event,'' and the journalists' association decries frequent self-censorship on such sensitive issues as Tibet, Taiwan and separatist movements in Xinjiang Province. But even the new chairman of the association, who describes himself as a strong critic of China, gives credit to Beijing for ''bending over backward not to interfere'' in Hong Kong's affairs, ''at least on the surface.''</p>
