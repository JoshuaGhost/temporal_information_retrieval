        <p>(212) 777-0303; 110 Waverly Place, near Macdougal Street; $; cigarette smoking at the bar; $$; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Mario Batali, the chef and owner of Po, and Joseph Bastianich, of Becco and Frico, have teamed up to convert the old Coach House into a spare, modern space with warm golden light, wine racks lining a wall and a table laden with fruits and cheeses. The food is rustic and flavors are bold. To begin, there are mixed greens tossed in a black-olive-and-blood-orange dressing; warm marinated portobellos with grilled polenta, arugula and stracchino cheese; and fresh anchovies, marinated and paired with mixed beans in vinaigrette made with anchovies and garlic. Among pastas and entrees are gnocchi with capon ragu and braised fennel; sweet-pea ravioli in lemony butter with fresh sage; soft-shell crabs garnished with sunflower sprouts and gremolata aioli; grilled guinea hen with sweet corn; and barbecued squab with golden beets and porcini mustard sauce. (Diner's Journal: 6/28/98)</p>

        <p>(212) 627-1233; 9 Jones Street, near West Fourth Street; $; Smoking at the bar; American Express, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
        <p>A congenial setting with well-prepared homestyle cooking is what this Midwestern family restaurant delivers consistently. For starters, try the black-bean cake and rock-shrimp cake redolent of fragrant basil; dandelion-and-beet salad tossed in citrus dressing with pecans; or the baked sheep's-milk cheese served with homemade pepperoni and green-onion mustard. Main courses include pan-roasted cod and lobster with sweet corn sauce and a summer-vegetable hash; fried chicken in buttermilk crust accompanied by gravy, mashed potatoes and sauteed garlicky greens; and grilled eggplant lasagna with zesty tomato sauce. ($25 and Under: 5/9/97)</p>
        <p>GROVE +  (212) 675-9463; 314 Bleecker Street, at Grove Street; $; smoking permitted in garden; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This winsome Greenwich Village spot offers a lovely 70-seat garden in the back where diners are allowed to smoke. The small, enticing American menu features starters of roasted-tomato soup served chilled and topped with tapenade croutons; bright beet salad with toasted walnuts and goat cheese; bitter greens and Bosc pear salad with Gorgonzola cheese, and tuna tartare paired with seaweed salad. For entrees, there are pan-roasted salmon with a yellow curry sauce, coupled with sweet corn and baby bok choy; seared Chilean sea bass drizzled with Sherry vinaigrette and accompanied by chickpea salad; and grilled pork chop served with lentil sauce, mashed potatoes and wilted spinach. ($25 and Under: 10/15/93)</p>
        <p>LITTLE HAVANA +  (212) 255-2212; 30 Cornelia Street, corner of Bleecker; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Little Havana is a cheerful and cozy Cuban restaurant done up with a colorful seaside mural and mirrors that lend a breezy illusion of openness. Tasty starters include the shrimp ceviche marinated in lemon and spices; lentil, kale and squash soup enhanced by ginger; mixed greens tossed with red peppers, mushrooms and avocado in vinaigrette; and black bean soup with spices and green peppers. Recommended main courses are sauteed shrimp on a bed of fluffy rice laced with slivers of green and red peppers; roasted pork accompanied by mixed rice, yucca and beans; buttery filet mignon in tomatillo and garlic sauce with plaintains; and sauteed chicken breast served with chorizo, white beans and green bell peppers. ($25 and Under: 2/18/98)</p>
        <p>MOUSTACHE +  (212) 229-2220; 90 Bedford Street, between Grove and Barrow Streets; $; smoking restaurant; no credit cards.</p>
        <p>This unassuming little place can be recommended for its delightful and inexpensive Middle Eastern fare. A typical way to begin is with an assortment of small dishes like smoky baba gannouj (mashed eggplant), hummus (chickpea with tahini and lemon) and minted tabbouleh, or with a tasty salad of spinach and chickpeas with lemon, chopped tomato and onion or lentils and bulgur with fried onions. Pizzas, made here with pita dough and called ''pitzas,'' are a Moustache specialty. Among the most popular are the ''lahambajin,'' prepared with a crisp crust and a savory Middle Eastern topping of ground lamb, onions, tomatoes and spices; and a tomato-and-cheese pitza, topped with artichokes or merguez sausage. ($25 and Under: 7/26/96)</p>
        <p>LE ZOO +  (212) 620-0393; 314 West 11th Street, at Greenwich Street; $; no smoking; American Express, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
        <p>Engaging French cooking in a lively bistro setting makes the continued popularity of this Gallic spot easy to understand. Appetizers may include seared scallops augmented by a confit of tomato, orange and mango; squash ravioli with mascarpone cheese and scents of nutmeg and cinnamon; and a hearty salad composed of celeriac, cauliflower, cranberry beans and apples in a verjus dressing. Entrees can include roast leg of lamb au jus with garnishes of Swiss chard and potato gratin; veal tenderloin finished with a port wine reduction and served with a fricassee of baby root vegetables; and pan-roasted salmon in a spice crust with a red wine sauce, served with sauteed spinach and carrots. ($25 and Under: 7/21/95)</p>
        <p>MI COCINA ** [Rating: two stars]  (212) 627-8273; 57 Jane Street, at Hudson Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This beguiling Mexican restaurant remains a neighborhood favorite for authentic and spirited food, friendly service and affordable prices. For starters, look for the quesadillas de hongos, or little pastries stuffed with shiitake mushrooms and cheese in roasted-tomato sauce; fried calamari with salsa ranchera and lime, and tender snails cooked slowly in a roasted-garlic-and-tomato sauce. Main courses include chicken enchiladas under a rich mole poblano sauce; cochinita pibil, or suckling pig, cooked in banana leaves and flavored with achiote and sour orange, flanked by rice, salsa and warm, soft tortillas; and chiles rellenos, a classic dish of roasted poblano chilies stuffed with a mixture of pork, almond and raisins. (Review: 11/1/91; revisited: 11/23/97)</p>
        <p>INDIGO +  (212) 691-7757; 142 West 10th Street; $$; American Express.</p>
        <p>This relaxed, attractive restaurant is warm and friendly and delivers Scott Bryan's seductive American cooking at affordable prices. Starters include wild-mushroom strudel ringed by a wild mushroom sauce; grilled asparagus and artichoke shavings tossed with mixed greens in olive oil and topped with Parmesan cheese; and seafood salad combining calamari, scallops, shrimp and daikon in an Asian-style dressing of ginger and black beans. Tantalizing entrees include orecchiette blended with rock shrimp, arugula, tomato and olives and seasoned with garlic and hot pepper; roast leg of lamb with rosemary jus and accompaniments of risotto cake and vanilla-perfumed corn; and grilled salmon in ginger-soy glaze served with a curry emulsion and sesame-flavored spinach. ($25 and Under: 2/2/96)</p>
