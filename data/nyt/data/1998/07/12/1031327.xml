        <p>We raised a quizzical eyebrow on hearing that Tina Brown had abruptly, insouciantly sashayed her way out the front door of 20 West 43d Street after six buzzful years as the editor of the New Yorker.</p>
        <p>This was rare news indeed. Resign? From The New Yorker? In the past, editors either died or were forced to walk the plank, their pockets weighted down with bullion. The restless Ms. Brown simply left, rather than commit to a five-year contract, signing on with Miramax, the film company, to run a new company that will produce a new monthly magazine, books, films and television programs. ''When something's perfect, it always seems like a good time to leave,'' she told The Washington Post, applying a nifty gloss to her tenure at what Fortune magazine recently called ''one of the biggest money pits in American magazine history.''</p>

        <p>This was rare news indeed. Resign? From The New Yorker? In the past, editors either died or were forced to walk the plank, their pockets weighted down with bullion. The restless Ms. Brown simply left, rather than commit to a five-year contract, signing on with Miramax, the film company, to run a new company that will produce a new monthly magazine, books, films and television programs. ''When something's perfect, it always seems like a good time to leave,'' she told The Washington Post, applying a nifty gloss to her tenure at what Fortune magazine recently called ''one of the biggest money pits in American magazine history.''</p>
        <p>Strolling past the New Yorker's offices, and stopping in for a haircut on the ground floor, we pondered the meaning of it all, as Frank, our favorite barber, applied his sensitive hands to the complex topography of our skull. Surely, life will be a shabbier thing without Ms. Brown, we thought. No longer will it be possible to speculate on our favorite conundrums. Is it S.I. Newhouse, the owner of Conde Nast, who's fed up with Ms. Brown, or is it the other way around? Which Florio does she work with, and how does she know which one is which? Does she truly understand the damage that a fused participle can wreak?</p>
        <p>The prospect of a Tina-less New Yorker dampened our mood. Ms. Brown ran the magazine as though she were giving a party in a deconsecrated church. Readers felt a guilty thrill at the brazenness of it all, grabbing a glass of champagne as they circulated among the guests. Here was Norman Mailer, jabbing a fat forefinger as he engaged in spirited debate with Queen Latifah. There was Jeffrey Katzenberg, deciding the fate of empires, as Richard Avedon clicked away with his camera.</p>
        <p>What larks! No more treatises on tectonic plates, Letters from Washington that read like a VCR manual, langorous ruminations on the fate of the earth, nattering Reflections or twitty Talk of the Town observations in the first-person plural. No longer did we have to worry with Bill McKibben in the Adirondacks. Away, dull care! The new New Yorker was a kaleidoscopic swirl of power people, synergists, media moguls, publicity pashas, superstars, and megamodels. It was more fun than E! and sometimes nearly as deep. When things got a little too giddy, there was always a report from the latest trouble spot to provide some moral ballast, and darned if writers like Simon Schama, Ken Auletta and Anthony Lane couldn't be just as long-winded and boring as the great ones.</p>
        <p>Occasionally -- well, more than occasionally -- some mauvais types slipped past the velvet rope. We confess to a certain perplexity at the thought of Roseanne Barr as a guest editor. That woman over in the corner with the spiked dog collar and the cat o' nine tails? Was she invited? And shouldn't someone have taken the drink out of Ms. Brown's hand before she started going on about Princess Di, or threw herself at Bill Clinton in an article that should have been titled ''The Sexiest Man Alive''?</p>
        <p>Besides, we thought, with an indulgent smile, Harold Ross's New Yorker was a bit raffish in its own way, and William Shawn's New Yorker, as decorous as a Sunday service, has spent so much time spinning in its grave that by now it's drilled a tunnel halfway to China.</p>
        <p>''Autres temps autres moeurs,'' we murmured, slipping an emolument into Frank's waiting hand. With a cheery wave, we sauntered off to catch up with the buzz about the buzz.</p>
