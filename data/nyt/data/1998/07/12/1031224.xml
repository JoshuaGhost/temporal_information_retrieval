      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SINCE 1962, the Rev. John Walsted has been dipping his sable brush in a mixture of pigment, water, alcohol and egg yolk to create icons on wood panels. He's a retired Episcopal rector and a keeper of the flame. Father Walsted paints in the iconographic style of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, during the 14th to 16th century. With his palette of egg tempera, and gold leaf, he meticulously approximates the traditional method. One such painting, ''Our Lady of Kazan,'' is shown here. On Friday, 23 of his icons, along with four Italian Renaissance paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, are to go on display at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's Father Walsted attended an exhibit of Byzantine art. ''I was struck by and became haunted with'' the images, he recalled. Instinctively, he was drawn to the genre. Now some of his work has reached far-flung locations: Aleksy II, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, has one of his icons.</p>
