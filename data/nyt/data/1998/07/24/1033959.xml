        <p>Op-Ed column by Russell Baker, who describes himself as onetime Washingtonian who came to New York full of doubt and terror and learned to survive and love it; offers valuable advice about living in New York to Art Buchwald, humor columnist and longtime Washington resident who is moving to New York (M)</p>

        <p>I am amazed to learn that Art Buchwald, dean of American humor columnists, has moved to New York. Buchwald's home base has been Washington ever since the British burned the White House. They would have gone ahead and burned Georgetown too, he wrote, but it was teatime.</p>
        <p>He is such a fixture down there that anybody who mentions the Washington Monument is assumed to be talking about Buchwald. Who could imagine Buchwald moving to New York? Would the Pope move to Las Vegas?</p>

        <p>I am amazed to learn that Art Buchwald, dean of American humor columnists, has moved to New York. Buchwald's home base has been Washington ever since the British burned the White House. They would have gone ahead and burned Georgetown too, he wrote, but it was teatime.</p>
        <p>He is such a fixture down there that anybody who mentions the Washington Monument is assumed to be talking about Buchwald. Who could imagine Buchwald moving to New York? Would the Pope move to Las Vegas?</p>
        <p>With his flair for irony, Buchwald has already solved the first problem facing everybody with New York in mind: finding a place to live. Too stingy to pay $2 million for $115 worth of living space, he has booked into a flossy Park Avenue hotel.</p>
        <p>Not only does this reduce his real estate costs; it also saves him from having to make his own bed.</p>
        <p>It also relieves him of the obligation to throw those famous New York dinner parties where everybody talks about real estate through soup, fish, meat, salad, cheese, no-calorie dessert, decaf coffee and piteous pleas for mercy from the dishwashers.</p>
        <p>Several years ago I took a youthful fling at trying to write humor myself and tried to cultivate Buchwald and learn his secrets.</p>
        <p>''There is no secret to writing humor about Washington,'' he told me. ''You just write what happened in Washington yesterday and the whole country will die laughing.''</p>
        <p>I'd heard old recordings of Will Rogers speaking that line back in the 1930's. ''I'm not surprised,'' said Buchwald. ''I told it to Will when he was first trying to break into the business back during the McKinley Administration.''</p>
        <p>My attempts to cotton up to the old master were only mildly successful. The high point of our relationship came the day at the Sans Souci restaurant across the street from the White House when he invited me to his table to gaze upon several Kennedys, a brace of senators, a Supreme Court Justice, Charlton Heston and Barbara Walters.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay this favor, Mr. Buchwald,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''You can call me Art,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Well, the favor can be repaid at last. As a onetime Washingtonian who came to New York full of doubt and terror and learned to survive and love it, I have valuable advice for this pilgrim.</p>
        <p>First of all, never make eye contact with anyone, Art, until absolutely certain that you're not dealing with a lunatic or a cabdriver. ''Never look a weirdo in the eye,'' is the ancient wisdom taught New Yorkers for generations.</p>
        <p>Cabdrivers may or may not be weirdos, but when they see a pedestrian crossing the street and that pedestrian looks them in the eye, they assume that this pedestrian is now fully aware that lethal machinery is aimed at him and is, therefore, responsible for taking the evasive action necessary to save his skin.</p>
        <p>Also, Art, I would never walk in neighborhoods where you can look up and see a construction crane looming 500 feet overhead. These things often fall down. Make a detour.</p>
        <p>In my New York era, I also used to avoid skyscrapers with the kind of glass windows that blow out on windy days and make a terrible mess on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>I don't know if windows still blow out in high wind. Maybe windows are better nowadays. All I say is that, when the wind is rising, personally, I still stay away from skyscrapers.</p>
        <p>In my time, there was a gent in the theater district who dropped chunks of concrete from roofs, and I stayed out of that neighborhood until I judged that his need to express himself by mashing somebody under concrete had taken another outlet.</p>
        <p>You can never predict when someone like the concrete-dropper will crop up in this great city. Wise New Yorkers read the daily papers closely and react accordingly.</p>
        <p>Many people's worst New York nightmare is of being trapped several hours in an elevator during a power blackout.</p>
        <p>The survival trick here is to insist on transacting all business at ground level. You'll be astonished how many people will come down 45 stories to see you. It gives them something besides real estate to talk about at dinner.</p>
        <p>Ah, I forgot the subway. Take the subway, Art. It's terrific. And whatever you do, don't joke about Giuliani. This is not Washington. Understand? The cops have their orders.</p>
