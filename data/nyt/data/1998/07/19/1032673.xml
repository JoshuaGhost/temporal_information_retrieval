        <p>VAIN EMPIRES: Poems, by William Logan. (Penguin, paper, $14.95.) A brilliant, cheerless performance whose prevailing spirit is an atmosphere of anger, sadness and disgust; many poems are meditations on mankind's historical enterprises, earthly, spiritual or intellectual.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>ANNALS OF THE FORMER WORLD, by John McPhee. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $35.) The history of the whole earth as elucidated from America's rockscape, containing four previous books plus a section on the Midwest, all performed at great length yet with becoming modesty.</p>
        <p>BE SWEET: A Conditional Love Story, by Roy Blount Jr. (Knopf, $24.) A raucous, funny memoir but a heartbreaker as well, an effort, by a writer who is both literary and down-home, to deal with memories of a difficult (and sometimes opaque) mother and of an awkward childhood in Georgia.</p>
        <p>BLOOD AND VENGEANCE: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia, by Chuck Sudetic. (Norton, $26.95.) An eloquent inspection of war, its crimes and their causes, pursued through several generations of a Bosnian Muslim family; by a Croatian-American journalist who covered the Balkan war for The New York Times.</p>
        <p>CUPID AND DIANA, by Christina Bartolomeo. (Scribner, $22.) A wry and provoking novel, set in Washington, in which, for a change, it's the women (including the narrator) who are into cheating, infidelity and the sacrifice of love to business.</p>
        <p>THE LAST RESORT, by Alison Lurie. (Holt, $22.) The place the world ends in this sparkling, smart novel is Key West, where a number of exemplary type characters have to stop and wait for whatever they are running from to catch up.</p>
        <p>MISSING WOMEN AND OTHERS: Stories, by June Spence. (Riverhead, $21.95.) Evocative short stories in most of which women (sometimes men) seem mired in perpetual states of transition: recent divorce, recovery from crackup, boring jobs; the author's first collection.</p>
        <p>MY HEART LAID BARE, by Joyce Carol Oates. (William Abrahams/Dutton, $26.95.) A certain vanity of soul, a belief in a special American national destiny, makes this novel's inhabitants easy marks for greed, racism and the workings of a cosmic con artist with a resemblance to Satan.</p>
        <p>PARK CITY: New and Selected Stories, by Ann Beattie. (Knopf, $25.) Three dozen fine stories, warm and cool at once, from 25 years of writing about men and women for whom domestic rupture occurs quietly, ordinarily and inevitably.</p>
        <p>ROXANNA SLADE, by Reynolds Price. (Scribner, $25.) A woman in her 90's passes judgments on the century and concludes that life itself is ''an adequate blessing'' in this novel by a writer more receptive to grace than is usual in these times.</p>
        <p>VAIN EMPIRES: Poems, by William Logan. (Penguin, paper, $14.95.) A brilliant, cheerless performance whose prevailing spirit is an atmosphere of anger, sadness and disgust; many poems are meditations on mankind's historical enterprises, earthly, spiritual or intellectual.</p>
