        <p>THE scene was a salesroom at Christie's in New York on June 18, the prize an 18th-century Newport chest signed, labeled and dated by one of America's greatest cabinetmakers, John Townsend. At first, hands and paddles shot into the air as 10 people swiftly bid the masterpiece up to $2 million.</p>
        <p>But then an air of secrecy descended on the room as the telephones took over: five unidentified bidders, then three, then two competed until the hammer fell on the last bid, for $4.7 million. It was the second-highest price ever paid for a piece of American furniture and the third highest paid at auction for any piece of furniture. (The costliest American piece was a Newport desk that was sold for $12 million in 1989; a year later, an Italian cabinet brought $15 million.)</p>
        <p>In one stroke, the sale underscored two trends now in evidence at auction houses: a surge in prices for Americana, and a growing demand for anonymity by a new generation of wealthy collectors.</p>
        <p>Some of the buyers bidding at Christie's last month fit the picture of these collectors: largely self-made millionaires in their 40's and 50's who have reaped their fortunes in industry, on Wall Street or in real estate and who do their buying discreetly.</p>
        <p>Things were different a decade ago when buyers like Eddy G. Nicholson set the tone at auctions. A New Hampshire-based industrialist and investor, Mr. Nicholson, who often paid $1 million or more for tables, chairs and chests, would signal his bids with folded arms or a nod from where he stood at the back of salesrooms. (He sold his collection in 1995.) Today it is a rare auction when major buyers like the oil heir Robert M. Bass, the computer magnate Anthony Wang or the Tour de France champion Greg LeMond are seen bidding.</p>
        <p>Why the secrecy?</p>
        <p>John Hays, who heads American furniture sales at Christie's, attributes today's covert style to a more competitive market. ''There are many more players in the field than there were 10 years ago,'' he said. ''The old guard has not disappeared, and there are new buyers at every sale. So you never know who might come from left field and bid against you.''</p>
        <p>The couple who bought the Newport chest agree, up to a point. In a telephone interview, the wife, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that she and her husband, who are both New Englanders in their early 50's, are more concerned about security and privacy than competition.</p>
        <p>And they have a passion for Americana, she said. The couple have been collecting Americana for 20 years, focusing mostly on New England furniture, and the Townsend chest, because it is so rare, offered a ''once in a lifetime opportunity,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''This is a trophy piece,'' she said. ''My husband loves the chunky feeling of 18th-century pieces, the turned legs, the ogee bracket feet. And I love the gunkiness on the underside; that remains basically untouched.'' The raw wood on the base of the chest, made in 1792, shows 200 years of dust, glue and insect marks, revealing, she said, ''the life of the piece.''</p>
        <p>Before they buy furniture, ''we first have to love the object,'' she continued, ''and our response has to be instantaneous.'' Then they study everything known about a piece and compare it with others at museums to better understand why different materials were used, who had to be employed to make the piece, how it had fit in a household and who had owned it.</p>
        <p>There is more to be discovered about Townsend, his work and his role in Newport, R.I., society in the late 18th century. And that may now happen. Morrison Heckscher, the curator of American decorative art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who is an expert on John Townsend, says the museum plans to do an exhibition on him in 2001.</p>
        <p>''There was no better craftsman in 18th-century America,'' he said. ''And there are more signed and documented pieces by him than any other American cabinetmaker of the period.''</p>
        <p>The museum owns 3 of the 25 pieces signed by Townsend -- a chest, a table and a clock -- as well as others attributed to him.</p>
        <p>''We would like to bring together most of the documented pieces so that people can see the breadth and quality of his work,'' Mr. Heckscher said. ''And it would be important to answer some of the big questions that haven't been asked yet: for whom was this furniture made and why was there a market for such pieces for so long -- 30 years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hays of Christie's hopes more Townsend pieces surface.</p>
        <p>''Buying a great piece of American 18th-century furniture is like collecting a rare baseball card of Mickey Mantle or even Tom Seaver, the ultimate when I was 12,'' he said. ''When you have a chance to complete the set, to get the best of the best -- you go for it.''</p>
