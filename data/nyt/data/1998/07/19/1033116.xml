        <p>THE corn season has started. Though fresh corn on the cob shipped from the South has been improving steadily over the years, in midsummer there is nothing quite like the local crop.</p>
        <p>It is wonderful to eat, freshly picked, every day, the still-to-be-sated appetite observing how it changes as the season progresses and various varieties are harvested. Do we ever tire of good old plain corn on the cob?</p>
        <p>If we do, here are some other options, which take advantage of seasonal peppers and tomatoes.</p>
        <p>Polenta With Fresh Corn And Peppers</p>
        <p>Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 cup finely diced sweet yellow pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</p>
        <p>5 cups chicken stock</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups polenta (yellow cornmeal)</p>
        <p>2 cups fresh uncooked corn kernels</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>Freshly grated Parmesan.</p>
        <p>1. Heat a tablespoon of the butter in a heavy saucepan. Add the peppers and onion and saute until soft but not brown. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Add the cornmeal very slowly in a thin stream, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.</p>
        <p>2. Cook, stirring, for about 15 minutes, then fold in the corn and the remaining butter. Cook 5 to 10 minutes longer, until the mixture has thickened but is not stiff. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve at once, dusted with Parmesan.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Wild Rice, Corn And Avocado Salad</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>1 cup wild rice</p>
        <p>Salt</p>
        <p>1 ripe avocado</p>
        <p>1/4 cup lemon juice</p>
        <p>2 cups cooked corn kernels</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped scallions</p>
        <p>1/2 cup minced sweet red pepper</p>
        <p>1 medium-size ripe tomato, peeled, seeded and diced</p>
        <p>1/3 cup chopped fresh basil</p>
        <p>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Put the wild rice in a saucepan, add three cups water and salt to taste, bring to a simmer and cook about 45 minutes, until tender. Remove from the heat, cover the pan and set aside to steam 10 minutes longer.</p>
        <p>2. Peel, pit and dice the avocado. Toss it gently with the lemon juice in a small bowl.</p>
        <p>3. In a large bowl, mix the corn kernels, scallions, red pepper, tomato, basil and olive oil with the rice. Gently fold in the avocado and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately or set aside at room temperature up to an hour, then serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Gingered Shrimp With Corn</p>
        <p>Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons ground cumin</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>2 cups fresh corn kernels</p>
        <p>1 ripe medium-size tomato, seeded, juiced and finely chopped</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds large shrimps, shelled and deveined (about 36 shrimps)</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat broiler.</p>
        <p>2. Melt the butter in a small skillet. Add the onion and ginger and cook until the onion is soft but not brown. Add the cumin. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Combine half the butter mixture with the corn kernels and tomatoes and spread this mixture in the bottom of a shallow baking dish with about a six-cup capacity. Arrange the shrimps close together in a single layer on the bed of corn and tomato.</p>
        <p>4. Add the lime juice to the remaining butter mixture. Pour this over the shrimp.</p>
        <p>5. Put the dish under a hot broiler and cook just until the shrimp turn pink and begin to brown around the edges. Serve at once, with a sprinkling of cilantro.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
