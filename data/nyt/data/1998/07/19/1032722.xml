        <p>A national identity is forged from many things, not the least of which is food. Would France still be France without steak au poivre? Would Chinese civilization have endured without Peking duck? A culture, after all, is only as strong as the language, religion, folk traditions and foods that bind it.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the case of tuna salad, beloved icon, staple of delicatessens and lunch boxes nationwide. It can be argued that tuna salad is a cohesive force in American society, that people either love it or hate it and that it is the rare individual who does not have an opinion about it.</p>
        <p>It is therefore with some trepidation that one meddles with this particular goo. So let me begin by saying that tuna salad is nothing if not a brilliant idea. Tuna's natural affinity is to be cooked until nearly dry and soaked in a sauce that provides both taste and moisture.</p>
        <p>Given its large flake, tuna is more durable than most fish, and it remains more intact. Its rich natural oil opens like river, capable, if not downright eager, to marry with a remoulade, or mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>As canned tuna became food for the masses, its preparation grew sweeter, saltier and more unctuous over time. Discriminating palates find it simpler just to reject tuna salad as irredeemable sludge rather than to coax the purity of the notion from the dross it has become.</p>
        <p>This is a shame, really, for in its own way, tuna salad is a reflection of our democracy. By rendering tuna accessible to all, we're left with a tuna salad that's unpalatable to some.</p>
        <p>But that's the purpose of reclamation: to salvage a national treasure and reinvent it for the greater good. To do this, you must study how tuna has been moistened and made into salads since time immemorial. You must investigate as many cultures as possible -- including archaic and exotic ones (gold mines for tuna) -- and you must try to imagine a contemporary context.</p>
        <p>And then you cook.</p>
        <p>You cook your tuna slowly, submerged in olive oil, in the Italian style, and you adjust it for American taste. You bake it over coals in the Balinese fashion or you grill it to make a salad nicoise. You try steaming, baking and pan-frying your tuna; you even mince it, to make a tartar.</p>
        <p>You cook it often, and you cook it well, and you write down the recipes for friends, family and readers. But most important, you write it down for posterity, because as a reclamationist, you believe as Brillat-Savarin did that the discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of man than the discovery of a star.</p>
        <p>Tuna Tartar</p>
        <p>8 ounces sushi-quality tuna</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons minced cilantro</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced shallot</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ginger, peeled and finely grated</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon safflower oil</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>6 grinds black pepper</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon lime juice</p>
        <p>1/2 small red onion, sliced paper-thin</p>
        <p>1 medium cucumber, sliced paper-thin</p>
        <p>20 large caper berries</p>
        <p>16 toast points (crusts removed).</p>
        <p>1. Dice the tuna as finely as possible, or put it through a meat grinder using the largest disk. Transfer to a small bowl and add the cilantro, shallot, ginger, oil, salt and pepper. Mix until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours.</p>
        <p>2. When ready to serve, mix the lime juice into the tuna. Divide the tuna between 4 small plates, mounding it in the center of the plates. Divide the onion, cucumbers, caper berries and toast points between the plates and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Blackened-Tuna Salad With Remoulade Sauce</p>
        <p>For the blackening spice:</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon paprika</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons oregano</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon granulated garlic powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>For the remoulade:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup mayonnaise, preferably homemade</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons minced capers</p>
        <p>6 drops Tabasco</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon tomato paste</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard</p>
        <p>3 grinds white pepper</p>
        <p>For the salad:</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds tuna steak, in 1 piece, about 1 1/4 inches thick</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 chunks</p>
        <p>2 bunches watercress, washed and tough stems removed</p>
        <p>2 heads Belgium endive, sliced into rings</p>
        <p>1 large tomato, seeded and diced</p>
        <p>16 large basil leaves, finely sliced, plus more for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. To make the blackening spice, combine all the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. To make the remoulade, combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
        <p>3. To make the salad, place a cast-iron skillet over high heat for 5 minutes and turn on the exhaust fan. Place the blackening spice on a plate and use your hands to adhere as much as possible to the fish, covering all sides. Place 2 chunks of the butter on one side of the fish and place it, butter side down, in the hot pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the surface of the fish is lightly blackened. Place the remaining butter on the uncooked side of the fish and turn. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the tuna is medium rare. Place the tuna on a cutting board and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. In a large bowl, combine the watercress, endive, tomato and the 16 basil leaves. Add 4 tablespoons of the remoulade and toss to coat. Transfer the greens to a platter. Using a sharp knife, slice the tuna on the bias into thin slices. Lay the slices over the greens and top the tuna with the remaining remoulade. Garnish with more thinly sliced basil and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Balinese Tuna Salad</p>
        <p>For the spice paste:</p>
        <p>15 shallots, peeled, halved and very finely sliced</p>
        <p>4 garlic cloves, halved and very finely sliced</p>
        <p>15 small green bird chilies, seeded and finely chopped</p>
        <p>5 lemon or lime leaves (see note), very finely sliced, or  1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest</p>
        <p>4 stalks lemongrass (see note), very finely sliced</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon shrimp paste (see note)</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</p>
        <p>2/3 cup vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>For the tuna:</p>
        <p>1pounds tuna steak, in one piece</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lime juice</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons vegetable oil.</p>
        <p>1. Combine all the spice-paste ingredients in a deep bowl and stir with a wooden spoon for 5 minutes. Set aside. Season the tuna with salt and pepper and sprinkle it with the lime juice. Add the oil and tuna to the hot pan and cook for about 6 minutes per side. Remove from the heat, cover the pan and allow the tuna to cool.</p>
        <p>2. When cooled, break the tuna into chunks and transfer it to a large, nonreactive bowl. Add the spice paste and toss. Allow to sit for  1/2 hour, or covered and refrigerated overnight. Serve with warm rice on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>

        <p>Nicoise Salad With Grilled, Olive-Oil- Marinated Tuna</p>
        <p>1 12-ounce tuna steak, about 1i inches thick</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>3/4 cup olive oil</p>
        <p>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1 pound small Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed</p>
        <p>1/2 pound green beans or wax beans, ends trimmed</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
        <p>1 clove minced garlic</p>
        <p>1 large tomato, seeded and chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped parsley</p>
        <p>1/3 cup nicoise or other black olives, pitted and sliced.</p>
        <p>1. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat a broiler. Season the tuna generously with salt and pepper and grill or broil very close to the heat source until it is seared on the outside but still rosy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the tuna to a small bowl and add the olive oil and sliced garlic. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.</p>
        <p>2. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, cool and slice the potatoes. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Bring another large saucepan filled 2/3 full of salted water to a boil and add the beans. Cook until the beans just begin to become tender, about 3 minutes. Drain the beans and immediately plunge them into a large bowl of cold water. When cooled, drain the beans and chop them in half if they are large. Set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Drain the tuna, reserving 5 tablespoons of the olive oil and discarding the rest. Place the reserved oil in a large bowl and whisk in the lemon juice, minced garlic,  1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and  1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the potatoes, beans, tomato, parsley and olives. Toss well and season to taste with more salt and pepper. Using a sharp knife, slice the tuna on the bias into thin slices. Lay the slices carefully over the vegetables and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>

        <p>2 tablespoons drained capers</p>
