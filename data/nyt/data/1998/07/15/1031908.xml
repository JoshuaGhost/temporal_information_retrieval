      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Sometimes Western civilization declines in deliriously funny style. Why bother to list the myriad offenses given by ''There's Something About Mary,'' the proudly obnoxious new film by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, when it's easier -- definitely much too easy -- to enjoy them? In the raunchy wake of  ''Dumb and Dumber'' and ''Kingpin,'' the Farrelly brothers have made a romantic comedy that's a hoot in every sense, worth a smidgen of disapproval and a whole lot of helpless laughter. But the Farrellys are as gleeful as they are crude, and they certainly aren't witless. The film works ridiculously well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all appearances) authentically inane.</p>
        <p>A prom, a crush and a cruel, cruel zipper set ''There's Something About Mary'' in motion. It seems that Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller in braces), a kind of Everydweeb, is destined to ruin the biggest night of his young life. Notably unsuccessful in recruiting a prom date (''If everything else falls apart, maybe'' is the best answer he gets), Ted suddenly catches the eye of Mary Jenson, played by Cameron Diaz with a blithe comic style that makes her as funny as she is dazzling. Miracle of miracles, Mary makes Ted her designated prom date for that fateful night.</p>

        <p>Sometimes Western civilization declines in deliriously funny style. Why bother to list the myriad offenses given by ''There's Something About Mary,'' the proudly obnoxious new film by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, when it's easier -- definitely much too easy -- to enjoy them? In the raunchy wake of  ''Dumb and Dumber'' and ''Kingpin,'' the Farrelly brothers have made a romantic comedy that's a hoot in every sense, worth a smidgen of disapproval and a whole lot of helpless laughter. But the Farrellys are as gleeful as they are crude, and they certainly aren't witless. The film works ridiculously well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all appearances) authentically inane.</p>
        <p>A prom, a crush and a cruel, cruel zipper set ''There's Something About Mary'' in motion. It seems that Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller in braces), a kind of Everydweeb, is destined to ruin the biggest night of his young life. Notably unsuccessful in recruiting a prom date (''If everything else falls apart, maybe'' is the best answer he gets), Ted suddenly catches the eye of Mary Jenson, played by Cameron Diaz with a blithe comic style that makes her as funny as she is dazzling. Miracle of miracles, Mary makes Ted her designated prom date for that fateful night.</p>
        <p>Resplendent in ruffles and a two-tone tux, nervous Ted may think he's out of the woods after he gets finished sparring with Mary's contentious stepfather (Keith David). And then -- oops. The zipper mishap occurs, and it is not in the Farrellys' nature to treat this as an off-camera event. So Ted becomes the sight gag of Mary's neighborhood (and the film's biggest wince) just before he is packed into an ambulance and wheeled out of her life.</p>
        <p>Years pass. Ted still loves Mary, so he decides to find her. While living in Providence, R.I., (the Farrellys' home turf) he learns that Mary lives in Florida and hires exactly the wrong private investigator to track her down. Something about the pencil-thin mustache and air of high fakery about Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) should scare him off, but Ted is still not famous for his acumen. (Mr. Stiller's indignant sad sack and Mr. Dillon's perfect sleazeball make a winning combination.)</p>
        <p>Soon Healy is chasing Mary and lying about it to Ted, which is all the storytelling hook this gag-filled comedy really needs.  The Farrellys, who wrote the screenplay with Ed Decter and John J. Strauss, just pile on the outrages and the whacked-out minor characters, among whom are a couple more stalkers with Mary on their minds. Lee Evans, the rubbery English comedian from ''Funny Bones,'' plays the supercilious academic who adores Mary and doubts Healy's credentials, especially when Healy begins passing himself off as a rich, sensitive architect with a house in Nepal. Even Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers winds up angling for Mary's affections.</p>
        <p>To reassure non-Farrelly fans of  sound judgment, there are at least as many zit jokes here as other types of witticisms, with Chris Elliott in the abrasive role of Ted's blotchy best friend. As equal-opportunity offenders, the Farrellys also kid about a serial killer, mental illness, wizened old breasts and a half-dead dog, and they make these things unabashedly funny. The dog and its sun-shriveled owner (Lin Shaye) are the film's looniest characters, and Mary's mentally handicapped brother is one of its sweetest. The joke is on Healy when, in trying to impress Mary with his bogus compassion, he cites ''work with retards'' as his cherished hobby.</p>
        <p>Destined for instant notoriety is a sequence that starts off with masturbation and ends up with hair gel. But by the time it happens, you're sure to be either in the unaccountably innocent spirit of ''There's Something About Mary'' or on the way home. I hope it's not the latter. The Farrellys display a crazy audacity that's worth admiring, and they take sure aim for the funny bone. ''There's Something About Mary'' may be many things, but dull and routine aren't among them.</p>
        <p>The film takes a welcome touch of the bizarre from the presence of Jonathan Richman, once of the Modern Lovers, appearing troubadour-style in peculiar settings (up a tree, at a hot-dog cart) to sing about Mary and her magic. Don't skip the closing credit sequence, in which the cast sings and clowns along to ''Build Me Up, Buttercup'' with a good-natured abandon that suits the film.</p>
        <p>''There's Something About Mary'' is rated R for its gross-outs rather than for sexual situations. Masturbation? Hair gel? Don't ask. You can guess.</p>
        <p>THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY</p>

Wessler, Bradley Thomas and Michael Steinberg; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 105 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
