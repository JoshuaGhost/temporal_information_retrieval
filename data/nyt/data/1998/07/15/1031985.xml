        <p>Once a merchant, now semiretired, Joey Coleman has worked or lived around Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, for 35 years, a witness to what has changed and what has not. So as he spent yesterday sitting with friends along Fulton Street, Mr. Coleman tried to explain a frustration felt and endured more often than seen.</p>
        <p>No, Mr. Coleman said, he wasn't surprised that a jury in Dutchess County -- a predominantly white jury, he pointed out -- had found the Rev. Al Sharpton and two others liable for defamation in connection with the 10-year-old case of Tawana Brawley. He expected little else from a white jury, regardless of the particulars of the case.</p>

        <p>Once a merchant, now semiretired, Joey Coleman has worked or lived around Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, for 35 years, a witness to what has changed and what has not. So as he spent yesterday sitting with friends along Fulton Street, Mr. Coleman tried to explain a frustration felt and endured more often than seen.</p>
        <p>No, Mr. Coleman said, he wasn't surprised that a jury in Dutchess County -- a predominantly white jury, he pointed out -- had found the Rev. Al Sharpton and two others liable for defamation in connection with the 10-year-old case of Tawana Brawley. He expected little else from a white jury, regardless of the particulars of the case.</p>
        <p>''It's something that people have begun to expect,'' said Mr. Coleman, 53, who is black. ''They always expect the negative.''</p>
        <p>When the subject is Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Brawley, it is almost a reflex to return to Bedford-Stuyvesant to measure opinion like ingredients in a recipe: How much anger, frustration or bitterness remains? Ten years ago, Bedford-Stuyvesant, then Mr. Sharpton's political base, became the center of protest after Ms. Brawley, then 15, accused a group of white men in Dutchess County, including Steven A. Pagones, of raping her.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a day after the defamation ruling against Mr. Sharpton and two others in a civil lawsuit brought by Mr. Pagones, there were no protests or marches in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The only fury along commercial Fulton Street was the amplified voice of a preacher leading a sparsely attended tent revival.</p>
        <p>But if time has doused the sense of rage, random interviews with more than 20 black residents underscored the lingering sense of alienation and frustration unleashed by the Brawley case. Ten years later, there is not the same palpable anger, but neither is there any sense of progress.</p>
        <p>''They're just after him, as they are after all black men, any black men who speak up for themselves,'' said Squire Holman, as he stood on Fulton Street. ''They want to degrade him.''</p>
        <p>Beyond Bedford-Stuyvesant, the defamation ruling was the talk of many radio programs tailored to black audiences. Speaking on WLIB-AM, Mr. Sharpton called the decision ''inconsistent and political'' and warned that it would ''have a chilling effect on activism and advocacy around the country.'' The program's host, Minister Conrad Muhammed, said, ''In our community, it's shoot, lock you up, ask questions later.''</p>
        <p>The tortured storyline of the Brawley case is now familiar to most New Yorkers: the sharp accusations against Mr. Pagones by Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Brawley's other advisers; the subsequent grand jury report that exonerated Mr. Pagones and concluded that Ms. Brawley had fabricated her story; and, most recently, Monday's ruling against Mr. Sharpton and the two other advisers, C. Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr. The jury began hearing testimony in the damages phase of the trial yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was at the Bethany Baptist Church on Marcus Garvey Boulevard that Ms. Brawley's mother spent more than a month in ''sanctuary,'' avoiding arrest for refusing to testify before a special grand jury investigating the case 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a few blocks away at the McCafe restaurant on MacDonough Street, the Rev. F. D. Waddell predicted that the decision, and the news media attention from the trial, would only help Mr. Sharpton by providing him with more exposure.</p>
        <p>''This will enhance his political situation,'' Mr. Waddell said. ''What he does, and what I like about him, is he doesn't allow something to be swept under the rug or forgotten.''</p>
        <p>The manager of the restaurant, Clara Walker, who said she had known Mr. Sharpton since he was a teen-ager, said, ''He tried to help but he might have jumped the gun without getting all the facts. I know he wouldn't put something together just to have something going. He wouldn't do that.''</p>
        <p>Despite the grand jury report, Ms. Walker, 63, like many other black residents, said she believed ''something happened'' to Ms. Brawley, even if Mr. Pagones was not involved. ''Someone knows something,'' she said. ''Something did happen to that child.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Joyce Turner, co-owner of Cross Boro Realty on Fulton Street, said she had early doubts about Ms. Brawley's story but that she believed nonetheless that Mr. Sharpton had acted in good faith. What she would like to see, she said, is some healing.</p>
        <p>''No matter who you are,'' she said of Mr. Pagones, ''I don't want the wrong person to be accused of something.''</p>
        <p>More than a few people criticized the news media as a biased messenger in telling the Brawley story. Speaking on the radio program, ''The Global Black Experience,'' Mr. Maddox accused the news media of conspiring with the judicial system to win a verdict against the advisers. ''If this case was properly reported,'' he said, ''everyone in this state would be in an uproar.''</p>
        <p>Standing outside her Albany Avenue apartment, Pamela Carter, 38, agreed with that sentiment. ''I don't even care what happened,'' she said. ''The media lies to us. They don't tell the real story. Sharpton, he's a black man, he's for the people.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Sharpton did not enjoy universal support. ''Justice was served yesterday,'' said a 47-year-old woman who asked not to be identified as she carried groceries along Marcus Garvey Boulevard. ''And I hate to say it, but Al Sharpton can't tell me nothing. He tried to raise a stink with it. Whenever something happens in the black neighborhoods, here he comes. But to me, it's because he just wants to be on the TV.''</p>
        <p>John Eberhart, 63, sat on a chair outside his apartment on Albany Avenue, listening to the shouts from the nearby revival. ''I think Sharpton should have checked before he went into it and accused the man,'' Mr. Eberhart said. ''I'm not saying he's not right, but I think he should have checked. Anything you hear out of somebody's mouth doesn't have to be true.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coleman, the semiretired merchant, said he believed Mr. Sharpton had spoken out in good faith, even though he himself confessed to some doubts about Ms. Brawley's story. The strong reaction from Mr. Sharpton and other black residents was not surprising, he said.</p>
        <p>''There has just been so much injustice done that sometimes blacks may overplay things,'' he said. ''It's hard for a black man now to believe all of a sudden that everything is on the level.''</p>
