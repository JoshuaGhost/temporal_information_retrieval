        <p>BANK OF THE WEST  Seles and Graf Win</p>
        <p>Monica Seles used experience and stamina to outlast unseeded Fang Li, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, last night in the Bank of the West women's tournament in Stanford, Calif.</p>
        <p>Li came out strong, making some seemingly impossible shots against the second-seeded Seles, who is ranked No. 6 in the world. But the more experienced Seles appeared unruffled as she easily took the next two sets.</p>
