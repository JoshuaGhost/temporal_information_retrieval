      <abstract>
        <p>Donald Hirt letter challenges July 29 editorial suggesting that Pres Clinton can get out of his legal difficulties by 'correcting' his presumably perjured testimony; cartoon</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You say President Clinton can get out of the mess he's in by ''correcting'' his testimony (editorial, July 29). It is a felony to lie under oath. If in fact he did this, you are suggesting he can make the felony go away by saying that he made a mistake and that now here is the true story. He would be admitting perjury.</p>

        <p>If your advice were applicable under law, we would have tens of thousands of contrite felons walking our streets instead of residing in prisons. Your liberal view of making everything all right by saying ''I'm sorry'' is one of the factors weakening our justice system.</p>
