        <p>Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that second-quarter net earnings more than tripled on the improved strength of its cable television operations, magazine advertising and Warner Brothers studios.</p>
        <p>The results at Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment company, exceeded Wall Street expectations and helped send the company's shares up $1.875, or 2 percent, to a 52-week high of $93.125.</p>

        <p>Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that second-quarter net earnings more than tripled on the improved strength of its cable television operations, magazine advertising and Warner Brothers studios.</p>
        <p>The results at Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment company, exceeded Wall Street expectations and helped send the company's shares up $1.875, or 2 percent, to a 52-week high of $93.125.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Wall Street's positive response might also have reflected the emphasis of Time Warner's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, on further debt reduction and higher growth targets, as well as Mr. Levin's suggestion that Time Warner would lease some of its cable property to telephone companies.</p>
        <p>For the quarter, which ended June 30, Time Warner earned $101 million, compared with $30 million in the comparable period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The company reported that after the payout of preferred-stock dividends, earnings were 4 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of 9 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation, which tracks earnings estimates, had expected a loss of 4 cents a diluted share.</p>
        <p>Second-quarter revenue rose 15 percent, to $3.67 billion from $3.19 billion.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters after the earnings were released, Mr. Levin said that the AT&amp;T Corporation's decision last month to buy Tele-Communications Inc., the leading cable company, ''has validated our valuations of cable.''</p>
        <p>Although he did not specify which telephone companies might strike a deal with Time Warner, the biggest cable company after TCI, Mr. Levin said that ''our plant will be used to carry telephony.''</p>
        <p>Edward T. Hatch, who follows entertainment for UBS Securities, said such deals would not necessarily be costly for Time Warner and could generate a new source of revenue. ''If AT&amp;T is interested in using TCI Cable to develop land-based telephone facilities, then Time Warner is interested in similar deals with AT&amp;T or other companies, and the phone company partner would put up the capital,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The earnings results include profit gains at the Time Warner Entertainment Company, a partnership with Mediaone Group Inc. The partnership owns most of the Time Warner cable systems, the Home Box Office and Cinemax cable channels and the WB network.</p>
        <p>The combined operating earnings of Time Warner and Time Warner Entertainment before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization, an important measure of performance for big entertainment companies, rose 17 percent, to $1.16 billion, on combined revenue of $6.53 billion.</p>
        <p>Time Warner's publishing division reported operating income before interest, taxes and amortization of $176 million, up from $157 million a year earlier. The results reflected significant advertising gains at Fortune, In Style and People magazines.</p>
        <p>Time Warner's cable services, which include Cable News Network, and Turner Network Television, posted a 20 percent increase in operating earnings, to $198 million, bolstered by increased subscription revenues at TNT, Turner Classic Movies and the Cartoon Network.</p>
        <p>The film division posted an 11 percent increase, to $122 million, primarily from television syndication sales.</p>
        <p>Time Warner's music business continued to suffer as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell to $96 million from $106 million.</p>
