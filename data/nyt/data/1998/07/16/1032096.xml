        <p>NEWS</p>
        <p>Curtain Call  They're at it again: John Kander and Fred Ebb, who gave the theater musicals like ''Cabaret'' and ''Chicago.'' Now comes word that their new musical, ''Over and Over,'' with book by Joseph Stein (''Fiddler on the Roof,'' et al.), is to have its world premiere on Jan. 6, 1999, at the Signature Theater in Arlington, Va. The show, to run through Feb. 14, is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Thornton Wilder play, ''The Skin of Our Teeth,'' about the Antrobus family and their maid as they survive floods, war, the ice age and the double feature. Eric D. Schaeffer, artistic director of the Signature, will direct.</p>
        <p>Money Machine</p>
        <p>Just as Broadway pumps millions of dollars into New York City's economy, so does London's West End theater nourish Britain's. According to the Wyndham Report, just published and said to be the first study of the scale of the theater industry, the total impact of West End productions in 1997 amounted to about $1.76 billion. The report said 41,000 jobs depend on West End theater; theatergoers spent $410 million on tickets for 11.5 million seats and $710 million on restaurants, hotels, transportation and merchandise. The theater, a major tourist attraction, contributed some $369 million to Britain's balance of trade. P.S.: The report calls London Theater Capital of the World, with more shows and bigger audiences than anywhere else, including Broadway.</p>
        <p>Family Jewels</p>
        <p>Tiffany &amp; Company, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Louis Comfort Tiffany, has opened an exhibition of the jewelry he designed for the 160-year-old firm founded by his father, Charles Lewis Tiffany. Situated on the second floor of the store at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street through Aug. 29 and titled ''The Jewelry of Louis Comfort Tiffany: Explorations of Color, Nature and the Exotic,'' the display of 34 objects, including a pink sapphire brooch, a green tourmaline-and-pearl necklace and an Australian black-opal brooch, explores the artisan's love of color, his fascination with exotic culture and his inspiration from nature.</p>
        <p>Journey's End</p>
        <p>In ceremonies yesterday at the Turkish Embassy in London, Britain returned to Turkey seven ancient sculptures from a Scottish steamer bound for Amsterdam that sank in 200 feet of water after a collision in the English Channel in 1894. The Castor Marbles, named for the ship, are second-century works that include a figure of Venus, a bust and five funeral monuments. The marbles have been valued at $40,000 but are considered of priceless significance to archeologists. They were taken illegally from Smyrna, now Izmir, by the Dutch Vice Consul Alfred van Lennep, who acquired many treasures for European museums. The marbles were retrieved from the Castor in 1994 by a team of divers.</p>
