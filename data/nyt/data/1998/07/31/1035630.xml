        <p>Exhibiting their usual skittishness in a period of stock market turmoil, mutual fund investors slowed their purchases of equity funds in the second half of July, fund companies and industry analysts said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Despite the recent slowdown, however, cash flows into stock funds so far this year remain well ahead of last year's record pace.</p>
        <p>Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, which together account for one-fifth of the fund industry's $5.1 trillion in assets, each reported sharply higher sales of stock funds in July.</p>
        <p>''We started out the month with cash flowing strongly into equity funds,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Fidelity, a unit of the FMR Corporation. ''But by the end of the month, investors were turning to safer havens, particularly money market funds.''</p>
        <p>Roughly $650 million trickled into equity funds in the week that ended Wednesday, partly reversing the $1.4 billion that flowed out the previous week, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., a research firm.</p>
        <p>The late-month downdraft in stock prices and cash flows hardly spells disaster for the monthly totals, which are watched on Wall Street as an indicator of sentiment among mainstream investors. Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a Santa Rosa, Calif., research firm, estimates that $18 billion went into stock funds in July. The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported yesterday that stock funds received $19.2 billion in net new investments in June.</p>
        <p>In recent months, investors have apparently treated their mutual fund choices in the same way as their stock investments -- flocking to the biggest names, while leaving the smaller companies lagging behind.</p>
        <p>Investors poured $3.3 billion into Vanguard's stock funds in July, up 65 percent from the previous month and 4 percent higher than in July 1997, a spokesman, Brian Mattes, said.</p>
        <p>Vanguard, the country's second-largest fund company, is having a stellar year, with $34 billion flowing into its mutual funds in the first seven months -- more than in all of 1996 and not far behind the $39.9 billion that the company received in all of 1997. Over all, Vanguard's take so far this year exceeds the combined flows into the funds of the next three largest sellers: Putnam Investments, American Funds and Pimco.</p>
        <p>Fidelity, too, reports strong contributions. Its equity funds took in $750 million in net new investments in July, up from $100 million last month, Ms. Crowley said. Fidelity's bond funds added $300 million, up from about $200 million a month ago.</p>
        <p>Other fund groups experienced slower cash flows in July. At Charles Schwab &amp; Company, which sells funds from dozens of companies, investors bought a net $574 million of stock funds in July, down from $896 million in June and $1.2 billion a year earlier. Bond sales, which were higher than a year ago, fell slightly in July from June.</p>
        <p>In the first half of 1998, $126.3 billion was invested in equity funds, up 16 percent from the first half of last year, the Investment Company Institute said. June's stock flows of $19.2 billion were about even with the previous month's total and up from $16.3 billion in June 1997.</p>
        <p>Bond funds added $4.1 billion in June, about half the previous month's net new investments but far above the $801 million that investors funneled into bond funds in June 1997. In the first half of the year, $38.6 billion moved into bond funds, way up from $2.1 billion in the first half of 1997.</p>
