        <p>It is a gift rarely granted: to walk in another's shoes, to feel the familiar road suddenly drop away, to know how sore your feet get after wearing the same wingtips or high heels for 10 days straight.</p>
        <p>For several hundred young professionals, displaced from their pricey apartments on West 44th Street until yesterday because of the Times Square construction accident, life over the last week and a half has offered an eye-opening lesson in the unexpected discomforts of being adrift in New York.</p>
        <p>''You just can't go home: It is unexplainable how much that affects you,'' said Cindy Dupree, who owns an artists management company and has lived for five years at 130 West 44th Street, above the Church of the Nazarene. After the scaffolding collapse at the Conde Nast building on July 21, she moved in with friends.</p>
        <p>''I got just an ever-so-slight glimpse of what it's like to be homeless, to walk around with blisters on your feet from wearing the same shoes,'' she said, a note of wonder creeping into her voice. ''And some people experience that every day.  Now I want to look at this experience and ask myself what about it is going to make me a better person.''</p>
        <p>Most of the streets around the building site were reopened a week after the accident, which killed one woman in her apartment at the nearby Woodstock Hotel and turned Times Square into an eerily empty canyon devoid of people and cars.</p>
        <p>But even after a measure of normality was restored, West 43d and West 44th Streets between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas -- the epicenter of the accident -- remained barricaded. As of late Wednesday, city emergency management officials were saying West 44th would stay closed until at least Sunday, but they surprised residents yesterday morning and opened the one street.</p>
        <p>The word spread quickly among the displaced artists, actors, students, lawyers and business executives who make up the bulk of the residential tenants on a block dominated by restaurants, small businesses and the Lamb's Theater. They came, incredulous at first and then whooping with pent-up joy as they ran toward their apartments with lumpy plastic bags in their arms and borrowed suitcases bumping along behind them.</p>
        <p>''I've become a high-priced bag lady,'' said 23-year-old Matthew Zik, a lawyer who lives at 123 West 44th Street. He emerged from his first visit to his apartment with a pair of worn New Balance running shoes stuffed into his briefcase for an after-work bowling date. ''We should have an evacuation party,'' he shouted to two neighbors who sprinted past him toward the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zik said his experience as a displaced person was relatively painless. He stayed in a hotel. His firm was tolerant of his limited wardrobe. Yet he is haunted by a chance encounter and its disregarded omen.</p>
        <p>''Two days before the accident, I walked by a homeless man on the street and looked right past him,'' Mr. Zik recalled. ''The man shouted at me: 'It could be you!' And two days later, it was.''</p>
        <p>For many of the temporary vagabonds of West 44th Street, it was the little indignities that vexed the most -- the homely polyester underwear bought out of desperation at the corner drugstore, the separation from a much-loved laptop computer, the empty space in a wallet where an A.T.M. card should be.</p>
        <p>Keiko Uehara, 32, a Queens College linguistics teacher who lives with her fiance at 123 West 44th, had to change hotels every day. ''Even though we say we are refugees, we keep getting kicked out because they say they are fully booked,'' she said. ''We have had to find a new hotel around here every day.''</p>
        <p>Living from vacancy to vacancy, not knowing when their building would open again and unaware that the Conde Nast builders were providing cash advances for just such personal exigencies, the couple bought a pair of cheap socks here, some basic T-shirts there and toiletries from wherever. Not wanting to overspend, they picked up fresh underwear from Duane Reade -- ''which, otherwise, we would never ever do,'' Ms. Uehara explained.</p>
        <p>Each day, like Old West pioneers, many would set out in search of lodging with a small but ever more burdensome wagonload of plastic bags. ''It multiplies because you can't do laundry,'' Ms. Uehara said. ''Now we need a cart like homeless people.''</p>
        <p>Her fiance, Raymond Hoogenboom, 35, returned to the apartment before Ms. Uehara did yesterday, still clutching a collection of Duane Reade bags. ''As frustrating as it's been, it made me think about people like in the Midwest, who get flooded out of their homes,'' he said. ''So I force myself to be positive. But a lot of people don't know what you're going through. It makes you feel alone.''</p>
        <p>After a few days of communal living with friends, many of the displaced wanted nothing more than to bask in solitude, shut away in a room of one's own.</p>
        <p>''If I have some problem, I can always handle it better in my tower,'' Basia Plewinska, a freelance writer who lives at 142 West 44th Street, said. ''It is so very difficult.''</p>
        <p>Many of the West 44th Street residents, who pay from $1,300 to $2,000 a month for one-bedroom apartments, were self-conscious about making too much of their brief foray into homelessness.</p>
        <p>At the end of every passionate account of being stepped on in the middle of the night while sleeping on friends' floors, of forgetting the answering-machine code needed to get their messages and of blowing their diets in daily restaurant meals, there was usually a mention of how petty it must sound in light of the more serious human cost of the construction accident.</p>
        <p>But then the passion reigned.</p>
        <p>''The aggravation I can tolerate, because I know a woman was killed,'' said Kevin Dean, an administrator at New York University Medical Center and another involuntary vagabond from 123 West 44th Street. ''But after a few days, it sinks in that you are homeless and it becomes demeaning and demoralizing.''</p>
        <p>He said he soon came to a startling realization, that his home and his belongings were his ''anchor in the universe.''</p>
        <p>''It's an incredible revelation,'' he said. ''I can't tell you how much more respect I have for homeless people. I didn't realize what kind of harm homelessness does to your mental state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dean's own mental state is much agitated. He said that claims officers at Liberty Mutual, the insurer for the Conde Nast builders, treated him ''like a criminal'' when he presented them with receipts this week for ''several thousand dollars' worth'' of business suits, shirts, ties, belts and a pair of shoes that he bought at a designer discount store, Century 21.</p>
        <p>''I'm an upper-middle-class person who has responsibilities,'' he said. ''Why do I have to be hampered in my ability to fulfill those responsibilities through the negligence of others? They were attaching the negative stigma of homelessness to the very people they are supposed to serve.''</p>
        <p>Liberty Mutual operates an emergency claims office at 1120 Avenue of the Americas for the displaced and others damaged by the construction accident and the virtual shutdown it brought to the Times Square area. As of yesterday, the insurer had paid out $311,381 to 485 claimants and had registered another 478 claims over its phone line, (800) 793-2797.</p>
        <p>John Cusolito, Liberty Mutual's spokesman, said the special claims officers were providing people only ''advances based on preliminary evaluation of their loss.'' He would not comment on Mr. Dean's specific complaint but said reimbursements were based on ''an individual's normal personal expenses and what is reasonable for the period of time before they're able to return home.''</p>
