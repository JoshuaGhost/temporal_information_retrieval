      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the early and middle 1940's, Preston Sturges wrote and directed a string of perhaps the wittiest, most sophisticated comedies ever made for the American screen. In the late 30's, though, he wrote before he directed. ''This is him seeing what directors were doing and saying to himself, 'Wait a minute, I can do that,' '' said his son Tom Sturges.</p>
        <p>This summer, retrospectives of Sturges films as a director, from ''The Great McGinty'' (1940) to ''Hail the Conquering Hero'' (1944), in Los Angeles and at the Film Forum in Manhattan (through Aug. 6) commemorate his 100th birthday. Many of the major titles have recently been reissued on video by Universal, and on Tuesday the studio will add four films written or partly written by Sturges but directed by others: the drama ''Imitation of Life'' (1934), the comedy ''Easy Living'' (1937), the adventure-comedy ''If I Were King'' (1938) and the comedy ''Never Say Die'' (1939).</p>

        <p>In the early and middle 1940's, Preston Sturges wrote and directed a string of perhaps the wittiest, most sophisticated comedies ever made for the American screen. In the late 30's, though, he wrote before he directed. ''This is him seeing what directors were doing and saying to himself, 'Wait a minute, I can do that,' '' said his son Tom Sturges.</p>
        <p>This summer, retrospectives of Sturges films as a director, from ''The Great McGinty'' (1940) to ''Hail the Conquering Hero'' (1944), in Los Angeles and at the Film Forum in Manhattan (through Aug. 6) commemorate his 100th birthday. Many of the major titles have recently been reissued on video by Universal, and on Tuesday the studio will add four films written or partly written by Sturges but directed by others: the drama ''Imitation of Life'' (1934), the comedy ''Easy Living'' (1937), the adventure-comedy ''If I Were King'' (1938) and the comedy ''Never Say Die'' (1939).</p>
        <p>The last film, a marital imbroglio starring Bob Hope and Martha Raye, was written with others. ''Writers then were like piano movers,'' Tom Sturges said. ''They worked in teams. One guy wrote women's dialogue and one the men's. Another would write chase scenes.''</p>
        <p>Now the general manager of Twism Records, a company partly owned by Shaquille O'Neal, Tom Sturges was 3 when his father died in 1959. Besides encouraging the restoration of his father's films, he has gathered many of the scripts into bound volumes, published by the University of California Press.</p>
        <p>''Easy Living,'' a riotous comedy directed by Mitchell Leisen, is about a feisty banker (Edward Arnold) who chases his profligate wife (Mary Nash) to a rooftop and flings her $58,000 fur coat off a balcony, the young woman on whom the coat lands (Jean Arthur) and the banker's debonair son (Ray Milland), with whom Ms. Arthur begins a romance.</p>
        <p>Sturges was never entirely comfortable with his scripts in the hands of others. '' 'Easy Living' goes about 40 miles per hour,'' Tom Sturges said. ''My dad would have made it go 60.'' Preston Sturges also frequently made deals to direct dialogue, possibly the strongest attribute of all his films.</p>
        <p>''My father liked getting two people in a room and seeing what they could say to each other,'' Tom Sturges said.</p>
        <p>Of the four films, he added, Sturges would have preferred directing ''If I Were King,'' based on a play by Justin Huntly McCarthy. Basil Rathbone is the ruthless and often hilarious Louis XI, who is holed up in a 15th-century Paris under siege by the Duke of Burgundy. Ronald Colman is the poet and rabble-rouser Francois Villon.</p>
        <p>In Sturges's rendering of the situation, the cunning and loquacious Louis, a born palace psychologist and obsessive conniver, is more taken with courtly manipulation than he is worried by the threat outside his walls. Villon remains in good humor despite being under the constant threat of execution.</p>
        <p>Sturges translated the poetry himself, adding the occasional embellishment.</p>
        <p>You have to admire a man who, while presumably being led to the gallows, is asked to say something humorous to cheer a tearful woman friend, and responds, ''His neck at last shall have the chance to weigh the tonnage of his pants.''</p>
