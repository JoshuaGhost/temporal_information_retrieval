        <p>GALEF-Steven A. We are all charged with the responsibility to help make the world a better place. Steve Galef aced that course. Steve was a master at finding the prudent, the enhancing and the positive. His integrity, sound judgement and professionalism were his bywords. He was strong, soft, energetic, even paced, compassionate and grounded. Steve served his country and his community with uncommon distinction. The world is a better place for his having walked through it. He will be missed for the remainder of our lives. We are blessed, however, by having touched Steve and, far more, by having been touched by him. Alice and Stanley</p>
        <p>GALEF-Steven A. The partners and employees of Wormser, Kiely, Galef &amp; Jacobs LLP mourn the loss of our senior partner, colleague and friend. His counsel, leadership and devotion to clients and charitable causes were an inspiration to all and he will be sadly missed. His wisdom and courage will serve as the standard against which we will measure ourselves in serving our clients and our profession. The firm extends its heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sandy, his children, Graig and Gwen and the other members of his family.</p>
        <p>GALEF-Steven A. Westchester Jewish Community Services mourns the death of our Board Member, Steven Galef. Active on several Board committees, Steven also supported the Gabriel Galef Fund for the agency's Learning Center. Our condolences to Sandy and the family. Harold Goldsmith, President Alan Trager, Exec Dir/CEO</p>
