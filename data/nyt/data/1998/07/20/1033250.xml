        <p>Peter Neupert, the Microsoft executive responsible for some of the company's most innovative, and risky, new media deals, has picked a new career with at least as much risk: venture-capital investing.</p>
        <p>Starting next month, the 11-year Microsoft veteran will join Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the Silicon Valley investment force behind At Home, Amazon.com and Excite, among others.</p>
        <p>As Microsoft's vice president for news and publishing, Mr. Neupert was instrumental in the formation of MSNBC, the company's cable television joint venture with General Electric, and played a key role in creation of Microsoft's on-line magazine, Slate. Brook Byers, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said the firm has known Mr. Neupert for years and come to respect his understanding of ''tech meets the con sumer and media worlds.''</p>
        <p>At Kleiner Perkins, he will focus on electronic commerce deals and have the title ''C.E.O. in residence,'' which appears to refer more to his residence than Kleiner Perkins's, since he will continue to live and work in Seattle -- and not in San Francisco and Menlo Park, Calif., where the firm has its offices.</p>
        <p>Kleiner Perkins now has one other C.E.O. in residence: Jerry Held, who was previously head of software development at the Oracle Corporation. Another person who held the title, Frank Fisher, left last month to become the actual chief executive of a cardiology medical-device venture in which Kleiner Perkins is an investor.</p>
