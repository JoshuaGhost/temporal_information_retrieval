      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Cable News Network executives yesterday retracted the network's report that the United States military used lethal sarin nerve gas in a secret 1970 mission in Laos with the intention of killing American defectors.</p>
        <p>The retraction, broadcast yesterday afternoon and accompanied by an apology, was based on an independent investigation, done at CNN's request, that showed the report's  conclusions were not supported by the evidence.</p>
        <p>The original broadcast, accompanied by the fanfare of advance publicity common in the growing community of broadcast news magazines, was shown on June 7 as the feature presentation on the first installment of the news magazine show ''Newsstand: CNN &amp; Time.'' The  broadcast, a joint venture with Time magazine, was hailed within the Time-Warner empire as the fruit of productive synergy between the company's disparate news-gathering operations.</p>
        <p>The apology amounted to a devastating admission that the report had falsely cast the United States Government, and in particular its military and intelligence arms, as brazenly using and concealing the use of one of the most forbidden weapons in the modern arsenal, a nerve gas banned by numerous international treaties.</p>
        <p>A day after the piece was broadcast, a slightly modified version of the account of a mission code-named Operation Tailwind was published in Time, which also made a retraction and an apology yesterday. Journalists at Time and CNN said yesterday that the story was broadcast and published despite reservations  raised by journalists within both organizations who received a last-minute chance to examine the report.</p>
        <p>A senior executive with the network said yesterday that Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and perhaps the network's most prominent correspondent, had been reprimanded for his work on the story. April Oliver and her colleague Jack Smith, the producers who had led the eight-month reporting effort, refused to resign and were dismissed. Pamela Hill, the senior executive producer of ''Newsstand,'' resigned.</p>
        <p>Saying that CNN alone was responsible for the erroneous report, Tom Johnson, the chairman of the CNN News Group, issued a statement saying, ''We acknowledge serious faults in the use of sources who provided 'Newsstand' with the original reports and therefore retract the Tailwind story.</p>
        <p>''We apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at Time for this mistake.''</p>
        <p>Time's article appeared under the bylines of Ms. Oliver and Mr. Arnett, whose career has taken him from Vietnam in the early 1960's to Baghdad in the Persian Gulf war. A Time editor reviewed the article and accepted its basic thrust.</p>
        <p>The investigation of the broadcast, conducted by Floyd Abrams, the constitutional lawyer, offered a microscopic examination of how journalism can go awry.</p>
        <p>''The CNN broadcast was not fair,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>It showed no fabrication or illegality, but a more subtle process of distortion that began when conclusions outstripped the evidence, continued when sources were encouraged to believe that unseen evidence proved their own suspicions to be true and was compounded by interviews laced with hypothetical questions and ambiguous answers. Ultimately, the report concluded, the journalists refused to give more than a glancing nod to eyewitnesses' denials that sarin gas had been used.</p>
        <p>''The CNN journalists involved in this project believed in every word they wrote,'' according to the Abrams report. ''If anything, the serious flaws in the broadcast that we identify in this report may stem from the depths of those beliefs and the degree to which the journalists discounted contrary information they received precisely because they were so firmly persuaded that what they were broadcasting was true.''</p>
        <p>But even as her work was being repudiated, Ms. Oliver, the producer, refused to back away from her conclusions. ''I feel that this report was solid,'' she said, ''that I made every step any journalist would take to insure its accuracy and that I had the full backing of management all the way up to the top.''</p>
        <p>In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Mr. Abrams said he had enlisted former intelligence officers from the investigative firm Jules Kroll to try to confirm the account through their own military, intelligence and diplomatic sources.</p>
        <p>The account of the Abrams investigation, which was posted on CNN's site on the World Wide Web (www.cnn.com), included numerous instances of overreaching in the broadcast. His report examines the five underpinnings of the broadcast -- including interviews with participants, information from nerve gas experts, confidential sources with knowledge of United States intelligence operations, a retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff --  and finds flaws in every one.</p>
        <p>The most-cited source, Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from mid-1970 to mid-1974, is 87, lives in an assisted-care retirement home in Maryland and is no longer relied on by CNN's military correspondents. And many of the answers he gave were to hypothetical questions.</p>
        <p>The accounts of those on the scene, where a commando unit had attacked a base camp and then called for backup air support, are dramatic. Particularly dramatic are accounts that the backup fixed-wing planes dropped gas to help the American unit escape.</p>
        <p>But, as one of the pilots of the aircraft said yesterday, when the CNN journalists interviewed him, ''I mostly got nerve-gas questions and I gave tear-gas answers.''</p>
        <p>The pilot, Art Bishop, now a retired satellite engineer, made a brief journal entry the day after the 1970 engagement saying his craft had been armed with cluster bomb units that carried tear gas and explosives.</p>
        <p>In his conference call, Mr. Abrams said that a separate document the journalists relied on was ''a bad Xerox.'' It contained a virtually illegible reference to a substance used in cluster bombs coded as ''25,'' the code for explosives. The journalist read the illegible number as ''15,'' the code for nerve gas.</p>
        <p>In another case, the Abrams report pointed out, one member of a reconnaissance unit near the action,  Jay Graves, ''was an important on-the-ground source of information for both the use of sarin gas and the presence of American defectors.'' The broadcast quoted Mr. Graves as saying: ''We saw some round-eyed people. We didn't know if they were prisoners or whatever.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Graves's qualifying statement -- ''I didn't see any of them'' -- was not used in the broadcast.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Oliver, the show's senior producer, Mr. Smith, said yesterday that he stood by the story.</p>
        <p>Reached at his home last night, Mr. Arnett said, ''I accept the Abrams report. The reason I accept his judgment is that I was covering the Baghdad crisis for about four months during the critical formation of this thesis. So I was essentially brought in late. I asked a few questions and I read the script.''</p>
        <p>In the last days before the broadcast, people in Time magazine's New York and Washington bureaus were raising concerns about the piece, several Time journalists said. In particular, Mark Thompson, the magazine's Pentagon correspondent, said he doubted the truth of the article's allegations. ''He thought it was unsupportable,'' said one correspondent who insisted on anonymity. ''The entire bureau was worried about it.'' Mr. Thompson was on vacation yesterday and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Several people at Time said Mr. Thompson and the Washington bureau's deputy bureau chief, J. F. O. McAllister, made their reservations known to editors in New York on June 5, the Friday before the magazine's Monday release. One editor who spoke on condition of anonymity said Time responded to these reservations by toning down the piece somewhat -- putting a question mark in the headline, for example; writing in the subheading: ''A CNN investigation charges that . . .''.</p>
        <p>Walter Isaacson, Time's managing editor, declined to elaborate on a statement he issued yesterday, which said, ''Based on our own investigation and that conducted by CNN, we have concluded that the facts simply do not support the allegations that were made.''</p>
        <p>The Time article was edited by John F. Stacks, an executive editor, and Johanna McGeary, Time's senior foreign correspondent, neither of whom returned calls seeking comment. It was also overseen by Joelle Attinger, an executive editor at Time Inc. who serves as Time magazine's liaison with CNN.</p>
        <p>''I'm heartbroken,'' Ms. Attinger said yesterday. ''I think we all take responsibility for it.''</p>
        <p>People at Time say the magazine relied on the 156-page summary in which Ms. Oliver detailed her sources, a summary that Mr. Abrams criticized in his report as selective and slanted.</p>
        <p>At no time, several people at Time said, did anyone question Ms. Oliver's material as insufficient or suspect, nor did anyone argue that the article should not run. Moreover, people at Time said there was no overt pressure from CNN to publish the article.</p>
        <p>But one correspondent said the timing of CNN's broadcast of the gas story -- which ran that Sunday -- was such that Time felt compelled to publish the article. ''Normally on a Friday, if there are serious questions about a story you can always hold it,'' said one Time correspondent who declined to be identified.</p>
        <p>Although Time has been working with CNN on polls and on the news magazine program ''Impact,'' the gas story was the first collaboration in the magazine.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., said the company stood by its alliance with CNN. ''It doesn't cause me to rethink the teamwork with TV,'' he said. ''All of us obviously learned some things here, and I'm sure as the weeks go on we'll have discussions about what are the appropriate procedures in any kind of joint venture.''</p>
        <p>Richard N. Kaplan, the president of CNN-U.S., said the network plans to establish a unit to review the material in longer news magazine-type broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 7, 1998, Tuesday  A front-page article on Friday about CNN's retraction of its assertion that United States military forces used nerve gas in 1970 misidentified the firm hired by the lawyer Floyd Abrams to help him investigate the CNN report. The firm is Kroll Associates, part of the Kroll-O'Gara Company; while its chief executive is Jules Kroll, the firm does not bear his name.</p>
