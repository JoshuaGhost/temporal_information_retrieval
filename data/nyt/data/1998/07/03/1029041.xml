        <p>What is American food? The question no longer has an easy answer. On the eve of the Fourth of July, here are 12 quintessentially American restaurants. Happy birthday. (These summaries, written by Eric Asimov, are taken from Ruth Reichl's and Mr. Asimov's dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times.)</p>
        <p>1. An American Place  *** [rating: three stars]  (212) 684-2122  2 Park Avenue, at 32d Street  $$$ All major cards  Larry Forgione was concentrating on American food back when people still thought of it as little more than hamburgers and hot dogs. When he opened An American Place 15 years ago, he set the standard for American cooking, and if he is not alone anymore in his veneration of local ingredients, the food is still top notch. Appetizers can be pure luxury, like a warm cake of tender lobster and chanterelles accompanied by potatoes mashed with white truffles, while his pot-roasted short ribs are deliciously tender with horseradish potatoes and grilled vegetables. For dessert, Mr. Forgione's strawberry shortcake is a star-spangled show-stopper.</p>
        <p>2. Charles' Southern-Style Kitchen  +  (212) 926-4313  Frederick Douglass Boulevard, near 151st Street  Harlem  $ Cash only  Fried chicken is a signature American dish, and Charles Gabriel, the proprietor of this storefront operation, has raised chicken frying to an art. With cast-iron frying pans the size of manhole covers, he produces crisp, nutty crusts that conceal delicious meat within. While fried chicken may be the peak of Mr. Gabriel's artistry, it is by no means all he does. Oxtails come in an oniony brown gravy that provokes sighs of contentment, while salmon cakes are light but forcefully flavored, a real treat if you can get them. Mr. Gabriel makes only a few things each day, and there is no predicting what or when, so call first.</p>
        <p>3. Hudson River Club  ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 786-1500  250 Vesey Street, 4 World Financial Center  Lower Manhattan  $$$$ All major cards  This stately restaurant on the shore of the Hudson is all-American by definition, from its showcasing of ingredients from the Hudson Valley to its view of the Statue of Liberty. So it warrants inclusion even though it has not been reviewed since Waldy Malouf, the chef who made his name here, left for the Rainbow Room. The chef is now Jim Porteus, who no longer offers the list of game dishes that was a specialty of Mr. Malouf. Instead, the menu now features classics like sauteed foie gras with apple-and-potato pancakes, pan-seared duck breast and grilled ''loin'' of yellowfin tuna. Yes, you can get Hudson Valley wines here, but you can get wines from almost everywhere else, too.</p>
        <p>4. Judson Grill  *** [rating: three stars]  (212) 582-5252  152 West 52d Street, in the Equitable Building  Manhattan  $$$ All major cards  Bill Telepan, the new chef at Judson Grill, seems to have made an extraordinary commitment to freshness; it is the key to the quiet but eloquent flavors he offers on his contemporary American menu. He presents perfect seasonal dishes like egg fettuccine tossed with morels and asparagus. The morels have a nutlike character, the asparagus adds a pungent crunch and the dish is just plain delicious. His grilled duck sausage, so lean it hardly qualifies as sausage, comes with a terrific warm potato salad. The food gets even better when it comes to main courses, like pork wrapped in a black mustard crust and lamb clothed in a coat of herbs, served with wild greens and potatoes. Mr. Telepan treats lemon sole very simply, serving the pristine piece of fish with nothing more than steamed potatoes and green beans. Fruit desserts, like the baba with roasted strawberries, are absolute delights.</p>
        <p>5. Mama's Food Shop  +  (212) 777-4425  200 East Third Street, near Avenue B  East Village  $ Cash only  What's more American than a place called Mama's? This Mama's is a simple spot with home-style American cooking and room for no more than 20 people. You go to the counter and point at what you want, and it is dished up. The main courses are fine, like moist, savory meatloaf, flavorful grilled salmon and fried chicken. But the vegetable side dishes really shine. Brussels sprouts have rarely tasted so good, split and charred and flavored with garlic. Carrots and beets are sliced thin and roasted until they are bursting with sweetness. And Mama's mashed potatoes are ethereal. Portions of the homey desserts are gargantuan, like apple cobbler, rich chocolate-banana-bread pudding and orange bundt.</p>
        <p>6. Mesa Grill  +++  (212) 807-7400  102 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street  Union Square  $$$ All major cards  Bobby Flay's stylized Southwestern cuisine is spicy and delicious, served in a casual, loud and bright room. Appetizers include such dishes as a blue corn pancake stuffed with barbecued duck and chili sauce, crisp soft-shell crabs with avocado corn salad, and chicken skewers with a yogurt-cilantro sauce, served with grilled flour tortillas. Words like chili and fire-roasted appear repeatedly on the menu, as in fire-roasted chicken with molasses-tamarind glaze, and blue-corn-tortilla-crusted red snapper, with fire-roasted poblano chili vinaigrette. Tender mouths are safest in the dessert sector, which is so far immune to the chili onslaught.</p>
        <p>7. Pearl Oyster Bar  +  (212) 691-8211  18 Cornelia Street  Greenwich Village  $ Mastercard and Visa  It's just a marble counter with a few small tables, and it barely holds 25 people, but Pearl Oyster Bar has won a large following with its casual charm and Maine-inspired seafood. Start with the oysters, of course, but look for the more delicate varieties rather than the occasionally behemoth bluepoints. Lobster rolls are meaty and delicious, and chowder is sometimes made with scallops and accented with fennel and thyme. The chefs and owners, Rebecca Charles and Mary Redding, have a way with whole fish, particularly sweet, delicate pompano grilled until the edges turn into an herby crust. The short wine list is smart and inexpensive. For dessert: a wedge of magnificent lemon-scented blueberry pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>8. Peter Luger Steak House  *** [rating: three stars]  (718) 387-7400  178 Broadway, near Driggs Avenue  Williamsburg, Brooklyn  $$$ Cash only  If you insist, the waiter will give you a menu, but there's really not all that much to read. For more than a century, people have been flocking to these bare, beer-stained halls to eat a single dish: porterhouse steak, served for two, three or four. The potatoes are usually good, and the spinach is acceptable, but the meat is the main point; it's the best steak in America. That is why the restaurant is packed seven days a week with people who, perhaps out of necessity, have developed affection for the beer-hall setting.</p>
        <p>9. Savoy  ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 219-8570  70 Prince Street, at Crosby Street  SoHo  $$ All major cards  Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner, scours the world to put together his unpredictable menu, but the secret of his many successes is the cornucopia of all-American ingredients he gets from his network of local suppliers. His current menu includes such dishes as morels baked in parchment with turnips and scallion butter; sugar snap peas with arugula, roasted peppers and feta cheese; soft-shell crabs with cilantro gazpacho and sweet potatoes, and salt-crusted duck, baked with bacon, spatzle and fiddlehead ferns. For special four-course dinners, you can reserve the upstairs dining room. The wine list is small and beautifully chosen.</p>
        <p>10. Tavern on the Green  * [rating: one star]  (212) 873-3200  Central Park West at 67th Street  $$$$ All major cards  Patrick Clark, who died in February, was a terrific chef, and he's left a culinary legacy for his successors to follow at this, the largest-grossing restaurant in the United States. But even he was not able to overcome the tavern's service, which can be unaccountably rude and lax. Even so, the people keep coming, for the glittery setting and for dishes like mustard-and-herb-crusted rack of pork, served with braised red cabbage and potatoes mashed with horseradish. The trick is simply getting the food.</p>
        <p>11. 27 Standard  ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 447-7733  116 East 27th Street  Manhattan  $$ All major cards  Few restaurants offer such an easy blend of casual ambiance and professional service as 27 Standard, an airy, amiably sprawling restaurant. The chef, Michael Smith, offers a menu that reflects the best of modern American cooking: he uses good ingredients in interesting ways and serves them in generous proportions. He has a particularly enticing way with vegetables. His pureed white bean soup, for instance, would be overwhelmed by the diced garlic sausage if not for the crisp shallots scattered on top. He cures salmon himself, which is not unusual, but he sets the slim buttery slices on chive-flecked pancakes, which is. The main courses show the same sort of imagination. Mr. Smith's style is to take a simple piece of meat or fish and coax the flavor from it by surrounding it with surprising vegetables. Steamed salmon, for instance, is served with radishes, ramps, mushrooms and a chive puree. A hefty chunk of tuna celebrates the fennel, figs and couscous with which it shares the plate. The wine list is small, well chosen and reasonably priced.</p>
        <p>12. Virgil's Real BBQ  +  (212) 921-9494  152 West 44th Street  Manhattan  $ All major cards  This big, two-story restaurant is a virtual primer on American barbecue, offering uncanny reproductions of barbecue styles from North Carolina to Texas, as well as dishes from other parts of the Southern food spectrum. Pork ribs and pulled Carolina pork are top-notch, as are biscuits, fried chicken and even hot dogs. In addition to a huge selection of beers and bourbons, Virgil's offers an unexpectedly interesting wine list, practically all-American, of course.</p>
        <p>Summaries of reviews use the star system; others are culled from articles (indicated by +), the $25 and Under column (++) and Diner's Journal (+++).</p>
        <p>The Star System  The New York Times's star system rates restaurants on the following scale.</p>
        <p>**** -- Extraordinary  *** -- Excellent  ** -- Very Good  * -- Good  None Poor to Satisfactory</p>
        <p>Price Range  The price symbols are based on the cost of a three-course dinner with tax and a 15 percent tip (drinks not included).</p>
        <p>$ -- $25 and under  $$ -- $25 to $40  $$$ -- $40 to $55  $$$$ -- $55 and over</p>
