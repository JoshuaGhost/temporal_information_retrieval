        <p>George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the principal owner of the Yankees, said publicly for the first time yesterday that his team would help pay the cost of building a new stadium for his team. But he did not say how much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner has said similar things in private, but by publicly discussing his willingness to shoulder some of the potential $1 billion cost of building a new stadium, he seemed to be making another bid to win support for his campaign to move the Yankees into a revenue-rich palace on the West Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking for a free stadium,'' Mr. Steinbrenner said in an interview with the radio personality Don Imus on WFAN-AM. ''We are willing to sit down and negotiate a deal where the Yankees would be responsible for some of the stadium. I wouldn't feel right just sitting back and saying, 'I want a new stadium.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner's comments came amid a protracted and bitter dispute between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, over whether public money should be spent on a Manhattan stadium for the Yankees and whether the decision should be made by the voters in a November referendum.</p>
        <p>And they seem intended to soften Mr. Steinbrenner's image. Just three weeks ago, Mr. Steinbrenner said he would consider staying at Yankee Stadium after his lease expires in 2002 if the Yankees draw three million fans this season and could be guaranteed similar attendance in the future.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' home attendance has climbed 17 percent this year to 1.63 million after 45 dates. At that pace, the team would draw 3.018 million fans by the end of the regular season.</p>
        <p>To pay his share of a new stadium, Mr. Steinbrenner said, he would put the money from the lucrative rights to name the new stadium ''into the pot'' during talks with the city; experts say those rights could bring in $7 million to $10 million a year. ''Cash and other financial techniques'' would make up other negotiable elements of the team's contribution, said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner's remarks did not surprise Mayor Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''Both the Yankees and Mets are willing to contribute to new stadiums,'' he said. The Mayor has called the stadium projects ''public-private partnerships'' and suggested using commercial rent tax revenues to finance the city's share.</p>
        <p>''He's always said privately that he'd put money into the stadium,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, who added that Mr. Steinbrenner's share would be ''whatever the Mets' is.'' A Mets official has suggested that the team  would pay about 20 percent of the $500 million cost of building a new stadium in Flushing, Queens, or $100 million.</p>
        <p>Revenues from naming, advertising and concession rights, deposits on luxury suites and club seats, plus ticket surcharges and bank loans are the common sources for teams' private contributions to the costs of building a stadium.</p>
        <p>In San Francisco, the Giants are using a wide array of such revenue sources to pay the full $306 million price tag of PacBell Park. In Pittsburgh, the Pirates decided to dedicate $40 million in such revenues to the cost of a $228 million stadium. The Pittsburgh Steelers decided to kick in $76.5 million, almost one-third the cost, for a planned $233 million football stadium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner is expected to announce later this year what the Yankees might do after their Bronx lease runs out, with possibilities including a move to Manhattan or New Jersey. And although he said yesterday that he is considering all options, including staying in the Bronx, his criticism of the borough seemed to rule that out.</p>
        <p>As he has before, he cited limited parking, traffic jams and the perception that the stadium environs are unsafe at night.</p>
        <p>''They should get in there, clean the Bronx,'' he said. ''There are parcels there -- if you drive there -- you'd be amazed.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the Yankees had to have a new stadium, he said, ''Yeah, I think we have to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubenstein clarified some of Mr. Steinbrenner's remarks, saying, ''He's aware of the comeback of the Bronx, but some of the old image clings to it.''</p>
