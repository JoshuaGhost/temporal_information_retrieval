        <p>When Birch Evans Bayh Jr., the notable Democratic United States Senator of the 1960's and 70's, first learned that his son wanted to run for public office, the elder Bayh was wary.</p>

        <p>When Birch Evans Bayh Jr., the notable Democratic United States Senator of the 1960's and 70's, first learned that his son wanted to run for public office, the elder Bayh was wary.</p>
        <p>''I guess my first thought was, was that something he really wanted to do or is that something he wanted to do just because his father wanted to do it?,'' Mr. Bayh recalled recently.</p>
        <p>And during the son's first campaign -- for Indiana Secretary of State in 1986 -- the father said he wanted his son to make his own way. ''If he said, 'Dad can you call so-and-so?' I would say, 'Yes, I can call so-and-so, but are you sure that's what you want to have happen?' ''</p>
        <p>The son, Birch Evans Bayh 3d, who prefers to be called Evan Bayh, won that race and went on to be Governor of Indiana. And now, Mr. Bayh, 42, is running for the Senate seat that his father lost in 1980.</p>
        <p>He is favored to win back his father's seat for the Democrats. But Evan Bayh is not a carbon copy.</p>
        <p>While his father, now 70, spent 18 years in office as a prominent Great Society liberal, Evan Bayh is a fiscal conservative who takes credit for balancing his state's budget, implementing welfare reform and cutting taxes. While his father wrote constitutional amendments, including the one lowering the voting age to 18, and helped block two of President Richard M. Nixon's Supreme Court nominees, Evan Bayh has practiced what he describes as a politics of ''pragmatic,'' incremental change, an approach that supporters praise as savvy and critics consider overly cautious.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes making progress a step at a time is better than no progress at all,'' Mr. Bayh said in an interview at the Democratic Party's campaign headquarters across from the state Capitol. ''If by demanding revolutionary change, I run the risk of accomplishing nothing on behalf of the public, then I'm not sure that's a responsible course of action.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayh is enormously popular in Indiana, with his famous name, his earnest manner, his good looks and his risk-averse governing style in a  state dominated by Republicans.</p>
        <p>He has also been mentioned as a prospect for higher office. Held up as the embodiment of President Clinton's ''New Democrat'' policies, Mr. Bayh gave the keynote speech at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. While he was edged out of prime-time airplay by other speakers, and pundits said his performance lacked excitement, Mr. Bayh came across as a good sport, appearing on stage with his wife, Susan, a lawyer, and their twins, Nicholas and Beau, then 9 months old.</p>
        <p>''He's the kind of boy the people in Indiana would like their daughters to bring home,'' said Brian S. Vargus, a political science professor at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. ''Mr. Clean, crisp, Boy Wonder, young, attractive, articulate, nice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayh gets chided by more liberal Democrats, who, Professor Vargus said, privately ''refer to him as a Republicrat.''</p>
        <p>While Republican leaders consider the race for this seat, vacated by Senator Dan Coats, to be their toughest senatorial election this year, they are running a well-credentialed candidate, Paul Helmke, 49, the three-term Mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana's second-largest city.</p>
        <p>''Evan still comes across a little  the empty suit,'' said Mr. Helmke, a moderate Republican who won a three-way primary and has achieved some national prominence of his own, as a former president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. ''He looks good. He sounds good. But there's a sense that he's trying to be all things to all people.''</p>
        <p>Born on Dec. 26, 1955, in Terre Haute, Ind., Evan Bayh was swaddled in politics. His mother, Marvella Bayh, was the daughter of an Indiana Governor, Matthew E. Welsh. His father ran twice for the Democratic nomination for President, dropping out in 1972 because his wife was stricken with cancer, which took her life in 1979.</p>
        <p>When Evan Bayh was 6, he accompanied his parents to the home of former President Harry S. Truman, where his father was seeking advice about his first Senate race. He remembers that Truman gave him a silver dollar and that sometime in the political discussion he blurted out, ''I have to go to the bathroom.'' Truman rescued him from his mother's mortified looks by saying, ''You know, son, I have to go the bathroom, too,'' and taking him there.</p>
        <p>At a White House dinner with his mother and father, Evan saw President Lyndon B. Johnson put his feet up on the table and was escorted by Lady Bird Johnson into the Lincoln Bedroom to watch television.</p>
        <p>''Evan grew up in a very public home,'' said his father, now practicing law in Washington. Mr. Bayh said Evan was aware that his father was controversial because of the judicial appointments and other liberal stances, and once heard a phone caller threaten to kill the Senator.</p>
        <p>Evan Bayh helped run his father's unsuccessful last Senate campaign, against Dan Quayle in 1980, and the loss ''probably hurt him more than it hurt me,'' the elder Mr. Bayh said.</p>
        <p>Eight years later, at age 32, the son was elected the nation's youngest governor and served the maximum two terms. Mr. Bayh, who contended with Republican-dominated Legislatures during his tenure but benefited from a robust economy, said his accomplishments included creation of 350,000 jobs and doubling the state surplus, to $1.6 billion, the largest in state history. He trimmed a deficit in state pension plans and sliced Medicaid spending to restore the state's fiscal health.</p>
        <p>There were no tax increases. He did try to raise taxes on hospitals and cigarettes, but was blocked by Republican legislators.</p>
        <p>Political experts say Mr. Bayh, who has been practicing corporate law since 1996, made few major advances on issues like education.</p>
        <p>''Most of his governorship time was devoted to dollars-and-cents  kinds of issues,'' said Jay McCann, associate professor of political science at Purdue University.</p>
        <p>Although a polished spinner of phrases, Mr. Bayh said he resisted ''generalizations'' and ''buzzwords,'' believing that most issues were complex.</p>
        <p>He gets ideas from reading history and biographies that he orders from a history book club. He just started Theodore H. White's ''Thunder Out of China,'' because he is ''trying to learn more about foreign policy and defense policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayh said that as Senator he would work to raise educational standards and support ''a flatter, fairer tax.'' While government should help the disadvantaged, he said, ''personal responsibility has to go hand in hand.''</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to find the sensible center,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 18, 1998, Saturday  An article on Tuesday about Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana and his candidacy for the Senate misidentified Mr. Bayh's maternal grandfather. He was Delbert Hern, not Matthew E. Welsh, a former Indiana Governor.</p>
