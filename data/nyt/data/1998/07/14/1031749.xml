        <p>Chris Martens, an ESPN producer, thought Mace Brown, a former Pittsburgh Pirate, was offering him a rare treasure recently. As a rookie pitcher in 1935, Brown witnessed Babe Ruth's last three home runs, slugged in Forbes Field as a Boston Brave. And, Brown told Martens, his wife had filmed the event.</p>
        <p>''That's like the Holy Grail,'' Martens said, recalling his anticipation.</p>
        <p>Did Brown, who turned 89 in May, have the film? No, Brown said. About 15 years ago, the film began to disintegrate. The Browns threw it out.</p>
        <p>Martens did get his hands on plenty of material, though, and it will be on display next Tuesday in ''Outside the Lines: Babe Ruth's Larger Than Life Legacy'' (ESPN, 7:30 P.M.). He had wanted to make a documentary about Ruth for at least 10 years, since collaborating with Ruth's daughter, Dorothy Pirone, on a book about the Babe. And he was not the only one on the cinematic trail of the legendary slugger. Within a month, viewers can decide if they learn more from ESPN's work or from HBO's ''Babe Ruth'' (Aug. 16, 8 P.M.).</p>
        <p>ESPN's is not a a biography but a smorgasbord of segments that examine Ruth's role as the first superstar, his self-marketing, his value to the memorabilia market, his impact on the language and his unfulfilled desire to manage.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to look at his legacy, because the shadow he still casts is enormous,'' Martens said. His research included placing an advertisement in Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper, to find any veteran who heard attacking Japanese soldiers scream, ''To hell with Babe Ruth.'' (He didn't find any.)</p>
        <p>Martens's discoveries included a 1946 letter Ruth wrote to Larry MacPhail, the Yankees' general manager, begging to manage the team; an unpublished memoir written by Emil Fuchs, the owner of the Boston Braves, for whom Ruth was briefly a player-assistant manager; and an agent's itemized list of Ruth's endorsements, which totaled nearly $500,000 over 18 years.</p>
        <p>Among those ESPN interviewed were Paul Hopkins, now 93, who surrendered Ruth's 59th home run in 1927. ''I threw my best pitch, a sinkerball,'' Hopkins said. ''He hit it over the fence. Gone. Gone. Gone.''</p>
        <p>HBO's work is a linear one, like its Joe DiMaggio film of last year. ''It's character analysis, biography, at times a fun-loving piece,'' said Ross Greenburg, executive producer of HBO Sports. It also has home movies, an HBO hallmark.</p>
        <p>''A major portion of the film will be a learning experience,'' Greenburg said.</p>
        <p>Martens set a similar standard. ''I've been through the Ruth legend so many times that I wanted Robert Creamer to learn something,'' he said, referring to the best of Ruth's biographers, ''and for the sports nut to learn something.''</p>
        <p>Soccer Deficiencies in the Booth</p>
        <p>ABC's Bob Ley and Seamus Malin achieved mediocrity on Sunday with their call of France's 3-0 victory over Brazil to win the World Cup.</p>
        <p>Malin provided better analysis than usual, even calling Brazil's corner kick defense ''criminally deficient.'' In a crucial oversight, he never explained how France, which was shorthanded for the final 22 minutes of the second half, could play as if it did not matter, and even score a third goal.</p>
        <p>Ley narrated more touches and sounded occasionally excited. But still, his was not a riveting, consistently strong call. In a key oversight, he did not offer a goal-scoring call when Emmanuel Petit made the score 3-0. If you don't make goal calls -- Ley did the same when Iran beat the United States -- you're not doing your job.</p>
        <p>In overnight Nielsen ratings, the France-Brazil game produced a 6.9 on ABC, or 4 million households, down from a 12.8 for the final in 1994. On Spanish-language Univision, the game scored a 22.2 rating and lured 1.7 million Hispanic households in the United States. Locally, the game rated a 4.9 on Channel 41, its highest-rated daytime program ever.</p>
        <p>The Unseen Home Run</p>
        <p>What happened to Mark McGwire's game-winning home run on Saturday? From 1 P.M. to 4 P.M. on Fox-owned Channel 5, New York viewers saw the Red Sox-Orioles game, intercut smartly with McGwire's at-bats from the Cardinals-Astros game. When the Boston-Baltimore game ended early, Fox switched for 15 minutes of the St. Louis game. But at 4, viewers of Channel 5 were shifted to ''Police Academy.'' About 20 minutes later, McGwire won the game. Did you see it?</p>
        <p>''We have station obligations, so unless the game assigned to the market goes past 4 o'clock, we go to local programming,'' said Lou D'Ermilio, a Fox spokesman. Why not make an exception to the rule because of the home run race?</p>
        <p>''Anticipation of home run 38 is not the same as anticipation of No. 58,'' he said. Would Fox have done differently if the game were played on Sept. 11? ''It's too early to tell,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Disney-Fox Detente</p>
        <p>The Walt Disney Company has backed down from plans to launch ESPN West, a regional sports channel that would have carried the cable TV games of its Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks. A new 10-year agreement will keep Angels games on Fox Sports West and Ducks games on Fox Sports West 2, outlets in Rupert Murdoch's vast regional sports empire. Disney and Fox had battled over the TV rights in court, but those suits were ended by the new deal. Tim Mead, a spokesman for Disney's teams, said: ''There was a need for immediacy. ESPN West would have had to be grown into. The powers-that-be felt this was prudent.'' And no doubt lucrative.</p>
