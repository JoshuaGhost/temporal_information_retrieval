        <p>Wine and wit are delicate travelers. And what makes one or the other savory in one setting is easily lost in the transition to another.</p>
        <p>So it is, for the most part, with ''Jayson,'' the syndicated gay comic strip that has been turned into a musical comedy at the 45th Street Theater.</p>
        <p>Taken in small doses on the printed page, the tart, keenly observed humor of its author, Jeff Krell, is amusing. But in its longer form, on the stage, ''Jayson'' becomes just  another routine sitcom, accompanied by some unmemorable music.</p>
        <p>The show, directed by Jay Michaels from a book by Mr. Krell, with music and lyrics by Ron Romanovsky and Paul Phillips, isn't dull. But its plot -- a ''boy meets hunk, boy wins hunk, boy loses hunk'' romance about true friendship and true love and personal honesty and parental acceptance of gay children -- covers ground that has been visited before and more tellingly. And pivotal moments -- the gay Jayson's decision to marry his female roommate, Arena Stage, for money and his well-built lover, Eduardo's, decision to drop Jayson and medical school in favor of a Hollywood career -- seem more arbitrary and out of character on the stage than on the page.</p>
        <p>Jim McNicholas contributes a set of Sunday comic strip colorfulness, bathed in never-a-rainy-day brightness by Roger Formosa, and Julia N. Van Vliet's costumes are a knowing complement to character.</p>
        <p>Stealing the show in a display of queenly bitchiness, flamboyant male and female attire and withering commentary is Craig Dawson as Robyn Ricketts, a producer of gay porn films like ''Locker Room Lust.'' Robyn energizes ''Jayson'' at every opportunity, from the moment he turns up shortly after the action begins.</p>
        <p>Boyish, decent and unassuming as portrayed by Brian Cooper, Jayson Callowhill, yearning for a career in advertising and true love, is a recent college graduate, newly arrived in New York from the confines of Farmville, Pa. In short order he finds himself with a roommate in the form of his old college pal, the sometimes shrill Arena Stage (Susan Agin), a dentist's daughter from Long Island, and a neighbor in the form of Robyn.</p>
        <p>''Jayson'' proceeds to have its fun with conflict between Arena and Robyn Ricketts, the arrival of the appealing Eduardo (Mark Haen) and the appearance of Jayson's ''American Gothic'' parents and Arena's Jewish parents. Kenny Morris contributes a gallery of comic characters in roles ranging from both fathers to a rabbi and one of Jayson's bosses, and Jane Smulyan has a high time as both mothers.</p>
        <p>But transferring ''Jayson'' from page to stage doesn't really improve the content.</p>
