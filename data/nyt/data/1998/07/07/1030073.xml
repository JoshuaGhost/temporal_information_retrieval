        <p>Investor optimism that corporate earnings will continue to grow and  interest rates will remain near historic lows lifted stocks higher yesterday, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index reaching another closing record.</p>
        <p>Led by gains in shares of Lucent Technologies, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Merck, the S.&amp; P. 500 index rose 10.91 points, to 1,157.33.</p>
        <p>''People are thinking there won't be too many disasters out there,'' Jim Benning, a trader at Bankers Trust, said of the quarterly profit reports, which are to begin appearing in earnest next week.</p>
        <p>In fact, investors are not likely to be disappointed. Traditionally most companies that anticipate earnings shortfalls soften the blow by warning investors well in advance of the actual earnings reports. Stocks then are likely to fall on the forecast, but may rise if actual earnings are no worse than expected.</p>
        <p>In addition, actual earnings normally beat expectations by about 2 percent to 3 percent, according to the First Call Corporation, which compiles analysts' forecasts. Therefore, near-term, beating the estimates should only be bullish if 4 percent or more of the companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 do so, First Call said in a recent market commentary.</p>
        <p>A large amount of the investor euphoria yesterday was also fueled by a decline in long-term interest rates. Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.57 percent. That matched its level on June 15, which was the lowest yield on the security since the Treasury began issuing bonds on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>Lower yields enable companies to borrow at lower rates and are expected to increase capital expenditures and to aid in lifting earnings.</p>
        <p>''People are not expecting much pricing power, so you're just going to have to act smarter and build smarter'' in order to lift corporate profits, Mr. Benning said. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average increased 66.51 points, to 9,091.77, marking its third consecutive close above 9,000 since early June. The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily laden with technology issues, rose 15.47 points, to 1,909.47, and is just 8.14 points away from its April 22 record. Microsoft, Ericsson and Compuware led the charge.</p>
        <p>In one sign of slowing economic growth, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of nonmanufacturing business activity fell to 61.5 in June from 64 in May. Readings above 50 mean business is still expanding, thus investors viewed the moderate June decline as positive.</p>
