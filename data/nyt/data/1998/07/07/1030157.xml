        <p>The sister of a Staten Island woman who was charged this weekend with nearly starving to death a child in her care was arrested last night after city officials found her 6-year-old son home alone, the police said.</p>
        <p>The sister, Chaniqua Allston, 23, was arrested at 10:20 P.M. and charged with endangering the welfare of a minor, said Officer Valerie St. Rose, a police spokeswoman. Officials of the city's Administration for Children's Services had gone to the home on a case visit, Officer St. Rose said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Allston called the police Saturday to report that her sister, Deanna Allston, 31, had abused five foster children, particularly Dennis Davis, a 2-year-old who weighed 18 pounds.</p>
        <p>In another case yesterday, a Brooklyn woman was charged with child endangerment after police officers responding to a domestic dispute found her three children unkempt and without food in a dirty apartment.</p>
        <p>A Police Department spokesman, Cadet Donald Stewart, said the officers saw the squalid conditions in the apartment at 183 Menahan Street in the Bushwick section and found the children -- a girl, 8, and two boys, ages 1 and 6, Cadet Stewart said. The year-old boy, he said, had been wearing a dirty diaper for ''a long period of time.''</p>
        <p>The officers arrested the children's mother, Carmen Burnes, 31, who was charged with endangering the welfare of a child. The children  were taken by the Administration for Children's Services.</p>
