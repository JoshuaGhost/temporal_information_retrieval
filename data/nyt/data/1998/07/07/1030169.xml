        <p>Five people died in a hospital on Monday night after security forces fired on a crowd demonstrating for independence in the remote Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, legal aid sources there said today.</p>
        <p>A member of the Indonesian Legal Aid Office in the provincial capital of Jayapura said five others remained in critical condition on the island of Biak, off the coast of Irian Jaya, while 14 were being treated for less serious wounds.</p>
        <p>Paul Baut, the legal aid official, said the situation in Biak remained tense this morning, with dozens of soldiers still patrolling the streets.</p>
        <p>At least 24 people were wounded on Monday when security forces shot into a crowd of several hundred raising a separatist flag in the province, where rebels have been waging a low-level campaign since the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Irian Jaya, bordering Papua New Guinea, was taken over from the Dutch in 1963.</p>
        <p>Two students were wounded on Friday as security forces fired live ammunition to break up an independence rally at Cendrawasih University in Jayapura.</p>
        <p>Separatist campaigns have been gaining ground since the resignation in May of President Suharto, who maintained an iron-fisted grip on the country's 217 provinces.</p>
