        <p>With the Liberty, which is undefeated at home, playing host to the Washington Mystics, who have not won on the road, last night's outing looked to be an easy one for New York.</p>
        <p>It was anything but easy, though, and it took a second-half offensive outburst from forward Rebecca Lobo to help beat the Mystics, 76-60, before 12,479 fans at Madison Square Garden. The Liberty improved to 6-5, while Washington, the team with the worst record in the Women's National Basketball Association, fell to 1-9.</p>

        <p>With the Liberty, which is undefeated at home, playing host to the Washington Mystics, who have not won on the road, last night's outing looked to be an easy one for New York.</p>
        <p>It was anything but easy, though, and it took a second-half offensive outburst from forward Rebecca Lobo to help beat the Mystics, 76-60, before 12,479 fans at Madison Square Garden. The Liberty improved to 6-5, while Washington, the team with the worst record in the Women's National Basketball Association, fell to 1-9.</p>
        <p>''We played well for the better part of the game,'' Coach Nancy Darsch of the Liberty said. ''We really struggled with their zone initially, but in the second half we came out and played well.''</p>
        <p>It was a back-and-forth first half. Each team made only nine field goals, and the Mystics turned the ball over 16 times in the half. After New York jumped to an 8-2 advantage 2 minutes 13 seconds into the game, the Mystics used a matchup zone defense to hold the Liberty scoreless for more than five minutes.</p>
        <p>Washington took the lead, and on the strength of the rookie forward Murriel Page's offense (11 first-half points) the Mystics were able to increase that lead to 24-19 with 7:19 left in the half. But the Liberty rallied, with forward Kym Hampton scoring the final 4 points of the half to give New York a 33-32 halftime advantage.</p>
        <p>The Mystics' turnover woes caught up with them in the second half as Lobo scored 8 points during a 20-6 run that put the Liberty ahead, 59-45, with 7:50 to play. New York set a season high for points in a half with 43.</p>
        <p>Lobo finished with 13 points and guard Teresa Weatherspoon scored a team-high 14 points. Washington guard Nikki McCray led all scorers with 16 points.</p>
        <p>''In the second half, we just needed more of an attitude of going out and doing what we're capable of,'' Lobo said.</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon and Sophia Witherspoon teamed for seven of the Liberty's 12 second-half assists as New York tied a season high for assists with 22.</p>
