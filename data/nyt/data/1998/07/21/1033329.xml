        <p>Voices were strong and hearts were wounded when the Royal Soul Explosion appeared here tonight at the Westbury Music Fair. The all-star soul revue was a respectful showcase for seven singers -- Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Chuck Jackson, Ben E. King, Lloyd Price, Percy Sledge and Irma Thomas -- who made hits in the 1950's, 60's and 70's. With the Uptown Horns band led by G. E. Smith on guitar and Peter Wolf as a dancing M.C., the revue set out to be something more than a typical oldies show.</p>
        <p>The format was intended to recall the package tours through which most rhythm-and-blues stars paid their dues, and it brought out the magnificent fusion of churchly fervor and show-business shtick that they polished on the rhythm-and-blues circuit. The songs, meanwhile, reaffirmed old-fashioned adult romance, realistic but still heartfelt.</p>

        <p>Voices were strong and hearts were wounded when the Royal Soul Explosion appeared here tonight at the Westbury Music Fair. The all-star soul revue was a respectful showcase for seven singers -- Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Chuck Jackson, Ben E. King, Lloyd Price, Percy Sledge and Irma Thomas -- who made hits in the 1950's, 60's and 70's. With the Uptown Horns band led by G. E. Smith on guitar and Peter Wolf as a dancing M.C., the revue set out to be something more than a typical oldies show.</p>
        <p>The format was intended to recall the package tours through which most rhythm-and-blues stars paid their dues, and it brought out the magnificent fusion of churchly fervor and show-business shtick that they polished on the rhythm-and-blues circuit. The songs, meanwhile, reaffirmed old-fashioned adult romance, realistic but still heartfelt.</p>
        <p>To hear the men sing, women ruled their world. Mr. Sledge and Mr. Chandler reached the peaks of their sets on their knees, and the other male singers sang about the loneliness and misery of unrequited love. Ms. Thomas had some sass for lying men, with a stretch of comedy in ''Wish Someone Would Care,'' and she deflated male pride as she sang, ''You can have my husband but please don't mess with my man.'' But in ''It's Raining,'' her coyly syncopated phrasing and the shifting tone of her voice traced a precise arc from affected nonchalance to desolation.</p>
        <p>The singers, all in their 50's and 60's, revealed voices that had changed but not disappeared. Mr. Sledge sounded the gentlest, and the most telling. As a songwriter, he specializes in utterly abject love songs, testifying to men's helplessness in the face of desire. His voice has hollowed out since the 1960's, leaving him with a high tenor that is vivid and ardent but almost wraithlike in its pained delicacy. For ''Let Me Wrap You in My Warm and Tender Love,'' he brought his wife, Rosa, on stage for a duet that they sang in each other's arms. And in ''When a Man Loves a Woman,'' which he sang with a humility that was a polar opposite to Michael Bolton's heavy-breathing bluster, Mr. Sledge knelt and crooned Rosa's name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson has unleashed his baritone since he made his big hits in the early 1960's like ''Any Day Now''; he started phrases with a gospel attack and worked his way up to big sustained notes with an operatic vibrato that suggested Mario Lanza. Mr. Chandler, suffering from laryngitis, made up for a temporarily iffy middle register with syncopated timing, flamboyant gestures -- he wielded a top hat, a cane and a cape for ''Duke of Earl'' -- and a pure, startling falsetto that was miraculously untouched by his illness.</p>
        <p>Ben E. King chose to toy with songs like ''There Goes My Baby'' and ''Stand by Me,'' letting his phrasing glance off the beat with a jazz singer's playfulness and barely dipping from his light tenor register to the baritone he has in reserve.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler, always a gruff singer, now had extra huskiness in ''Only the Strong Survive'' and ''Your Precious Love,'' but he used it to push phrases like a preacher. And Mr. Price sounded as jaunty as he did nearly 40 years ago, praising a girl's ''Personality'' or detailing the gunplay in ''Stagger Lee.'' The band, which was stiff and tinny for much of the show, found some gusto for the New Orleans rhythms.</p>
        <p>As each singer commanded the stage, it was obvious where current rhythm-and-blues singers learned how to woo audiences. And when the soul veterans sang about decades-old romances with undimmed ardor and indelible voices, it was easy to push aside grim thoughts about the way the music business discards aging performers and to savor not just the passion, but the perserverance.</p>
