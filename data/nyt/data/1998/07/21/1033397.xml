        <p>The trial in the first lawsuit aimed at preventing the City University of New York from halting remedial classes at its four-year colleges opened yesterday with several witnesses saying that CUNY's board tried to restrict public access to the tumultuous meeting in late May at which it banned the courses.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, brought by William Crain, a psychology professor at City College, and David Suker, a student there, charges that the board repeatedly violated the state's open meetings law by meeting in rooms too small to accommodate everyone who wanted to attend and by giving preferential seating to staff members.</p>

        <p>The trial in the first lawsuit aimed at preventing the City University of New York from halting remedial classes at its four-year colleges opened yesterday with several witnesses saying that CUNY's board tried to restrict public access to the tumultuous meeting in late May at which it banned the courses.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, brought by William Crain, a psychology professor at City College, and David Suker, a student there, charges that the board repeatedly violated the state's open meetings law by meeting in rooms too small to accommodate everyone who wanted to attend and by giving preferential seating to staff members.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in 1995 and amended this year to include recent meetings, including the one on May 26 at which Anne A. Paolucci, CUNY's chairwoman, ordered the room cleared after several disruptions.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's hearing before Justice Elliot Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, three witnesses -- Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan; Richard B. Stone, a CUNY trustee, and Sandi E. Cooper, the former chairwoman of the CUNY Faculty Senate -- described the crowded boardroom on May 26 and how Dr. Paolucci had removed almost everyone in the audience.</p>
        <p>''The open meeting law is absolutely important,'' Mr. Sullivan said outside the courtroom after he had testified. He was arrested on trespassing charges when CUNY guards cleared the boardroom on May 26 and he refused to leave. He spent 21 hours in custody before the charges against him were dropped.</p>
        <p>''The public should have a right to observe what's going on,'' said Mr. Sullivan, whose Assembly district covers the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ''If a meeting is disrupted, those who were disruptive should be asked to leave. Those who were not should be allowed to stay.''</p>
