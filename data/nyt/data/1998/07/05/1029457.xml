        <p>Last summer, Bob DeBris, a photographer, loaded up his truck and drove from California to Roswell, N.M. His mission? To document a weeklong festival honoring the golden anniversary of the Roswell Incident, a famous alleged alien crash landing in July 1947. DeBris took his time getting there, pulling off the highway for any attraction that remotely said ''space,'' including the Space Age Lodge in Gila Bend, Ariz., and the burial place of Ham the astrochimp in Alamogordo, N.M. Along the way, he met U.F.O. researchers, people in alien garb (like the ''Yellow Foam Alien'' spotted at a Roswell bash, pictured right), bushy-haired surfers, cowgirls and more. Among the 35 photos from his trip -- now on display at the Roswell Museum and Art Center -- his favorite is ''of a girl who told me simply, 'If you don't believe, just pretend.''''</p>
