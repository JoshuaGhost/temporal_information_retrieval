        <p>Max Frankel Word &amp; Image column on California Supreme Court ruling in suit by accident victim over television coverage that media cannot by punished for publishing 'private facts' about 'newsworthy' event but can be sued for using 'intrusive tactics;' holds arguments approving publication of private matters contain potential threat to news gathering and arguments deploring intrusive tactics leave media probably excessive latitude; scores stand that news value depends on 'social value' of published material; photo (M)</p>

        <p>In media law, it is often a case of give me liberty or give me space. Often, the freedom of the media turns out to rob some citizens of privacy, and the edification of a mass audience requires the mortification of some individuals. The instruments of intrusion grow more powerful in every decade, but the tension between liberty and privacy persists unchanged.</p>
        <p>More than a century has passed since Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren complained in a famous Harvard Law Review essay about the invention of ''new mechanical devices'' and ''instantaneous photographs'' that allow the media to overstep ''the obvious bounds of propriety and decency.'' Things that should be ''whispered in the closet'' were being widely published merely to satisfy ''that weak side of human nature that is never wholly cast down by the misfortunes and frailties of our neighbors.'' Just imagine: poor Brandeis objected in 1890 to reading ''the details of sexual relations'' in his morning paper!</p>

        <p>In media law, it is often a case of give me liberty or give me space. Often, the freedom of the media turns out to rob some citizens of privacy, and the edification of a mass audience requires the mortification of some individuals. The instruments of intrusion grow more powerful in every decade, but the tension between liberty and privacy persists unchanged.</p>
        <p>More than a century has passed since Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren complained in a famous Harvard Law Review essay about the invention of ''new mechanical devices'' and ''instantaneous photographs'' that allow the media to overstep ''the obvious bounds of propriety and decency.'' Things that should be ''whispered in the closet'' were being widely published merely to satisfy ''that weak side of human nature that is never wholly cast down by the misfortunes and frailties of our neighbors.'' Just imagine: poor Brandeis objected in 1890 to reading ''the details of sexual relations'' in his morning paper!</p>
        <p>Yet neither Brandeis nor his brethren on the United States Supreme Court could ever devise a grand formula that would safeguard privacy without damaging press freedom. They have resolved conflicts one case at a time, explicitly warning against generalization. So, by default, American law has recognized virtually no right of privacy when events cast a person as actor, witness or victim in a public drama -- provided only that the media obey the laws governing conduct, like trespass and eavesdropping.</p>
        <p>But now the legal world is abuzz with news from California, whose Supreme Court dared last month to venture a general theory of permissible media intrusions. Its judgment may bear on dozens of suits around the country in which news cameras and microphones gave offense by recording the agonies, fears and intimacies of people without their permission or even knowledge.</p>
        <p>The precipitating California event was an accident in 1990 that left</p>
        <p>Ruth Shulman pinned under her overturned car in a ravine beside a freeway, in pain and disoriented, with spinal injuries that made her a paraplegic. While emergency crews struggled to cut her free, a rescue helicopter brought in Laura Carnahan, a flight nurse, and Joel Cooke, a cameraman who was recording the responses of Mercy Air, a private company, for a now-defunct television show syndicated by Group W and 4MN Productions. The nurse wore a tiny microphone as she crawled under the car, recording Shulman's anxieties, her wish that she were dreaming, her begging to die. The mike and camera also followed Shulman on the helicopter ride to a hospital.</p>
        <p>In the discreet nine-minute documentary that was broadcast several months later, Shulman could be heard but not readily identified by strangers. So a trial court summarily dismissed her suit for invasions of privacy on the ground that the media enjoyed blanket protection when covering a news event. A court of appeal, however, thought a jury should decide whether ''private facts'' about Shulman's condition and treatment were truly newsworthy and whether the microphone and camera were impermissibly intrusive.</p>
        <p>The California Supreme Court took a year to reason through the thicket of case histories and, with shifting pluralities of 5-2, proclaimed two broad concepts: that the media cannot be punished for publishing ''private facts'' about a ''newsworthy'' event but that they can be tried for ''intrusive tactics'' even when pursuing news of ''legitimate public concern.'' The freedom to publish news was broadly reaffirmed, though the media's conduct in eavesdropping on a medical situation might strike a jury as tantamount to invasion of a hospital room.</p>
        <p>At first blush, it seemed like a good resolution of the case. However, as I thought about the court's generalizations, I found myself twice troubled. First, because the arguments approving publication of ''private matters'' actually contained a potential threat to news gathering. And second, because the arguments deploring intrusive tactics left the media very wide and probably excessive latitude.</p>
        <p>Concerning the right to publish private matters, the court dutifully warned that judges must never play editor. But it betrayed that stricture by then insisting that privacy cases require judges to decide what is ''newsworthy.'' Contending that ''what interests the public is not automatically a matter of legitimate public interest,'' the court concluded that news value depended on the ''social value'' of the published material.</p>
        <p>Two dissenters quickly spotted the danger in that invitation to evaluate editorial content. And I soon spotted the judges' lack of aptitude for editing. They thought auto accidents were of interest only to people who ride in auto-mobiles and that rescue services were of interest mainly because members of the public expect to need them someday. The judges seemed oblivious to the public's interest as taxpayers, neighbors and, yes, nosy rubberneckers.</p>
        <p>Turning next to media tactics, the court let the Shulman suit go to trial but gratuitously endorsed the use of hidden microphones and cameras as ''powerful investigative tools.'' It said a jury might find this particular ambulance intrusion to be ''highly offensive'' but raised no objection to the unfair intrusion on a victim by a nurse doubling as a television reporter.</p>
        <p>That serious omission risks validating many media ''ride alongs'' who furtively bring cameras and microphones to police drug busts, shootouts and rescue missions. Citizens who call 911 are thus often turned into unwitting performers. As the court should have noted, the police and other public agents wear uniforms precisely to distinguish their unique functions and rights of intrusion. No citizen should have to wonder whether a cop, fireman or nurse is also engaged in turning private pain and horror into a television show.</p>
        <p>I concluded that the California court was too stingy in authorizing the publishing of private facts and much too generous with intrusive media tactics. It dealt reasonably with the case at hand, but proved again the wisdom of not proclaiming grand theories of privacy. Unlike trespass, assault or other damaging behavior, ''invasion of privacy'' remains a loose and variable term, very much a function of changing taste. Better to avoid generalization for another century.</p>
