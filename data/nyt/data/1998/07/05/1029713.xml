        <p>For people who live and work on the Upper West Side, one of the most nagging local questions is: When will the project that ate Lincoln Center ever end? For a year, they have endured digging, jackhammering and bulldozing at three huge holes adjacent to Alice Tully Hall, Tower Records and the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore.</p>
        <p>The holes are part of the $16 million renovation and expansion of the West 66th Street subway station for the 1 and 9 trains, according to Community Board 7, which covers the Upper West Side. Weekly ridership at the Lincoln Center stop has soared 12 percent in the last few years, according to the Lincoln Square Business Improvement District, citing Transit Authority data. The surge is largely due to new apartment buildings and the popularity of relatively new businesses, like Sony Lincoln Square movie theaters.</p>

        <p>For people who live and work on the Upper West Side, one of the most nagging local questions is: When will the project that ate Lincoln Center ever end? For a year, they have endured digging, jackhammering and bulldozing at three huge holes adjacent to Alice Tully Hall, Tower Records and the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore.</p>
        <p>The holes are part of the $16 million renovation and expansion of the West 66th Street subway station for the 1 and 9 trains, according to Community Board 7, which covers the Upper West Side. Weekly ridership at the Lincoln Center stop has soared 12 percent in the last few years, according to the Lincoln Square Business Improvement District, citing Transit Authority data. The surge is largely due to new apartment buildings and the popularity of relatively new businesses, like Sony Lincoln Square movie theaters.</p>
        <p>The holes are immense -- the one in front of Alice Tully Hall is the length of a city block and the width of three buses. But the project is actually on track, or even a few months ahead of schedule, said Penny Ryan, district manager for Board 7. Just last week, she noted, workers covered the large hole in front of Tower Records and began restoring the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>''It just seems like the holes are getting bigger, deeper and uglier,'' Ms. Ryan said. ''But as far as we can see everything is conforming to what the T.A. has been telling us, and they may be anywhere from three to six months ahead of schedule.'' Monica Blum, president of the Lincoln Square Business Improvement District, said members seemed satisfied with the project. ''But we'll sure be glad when it's over,'' she said.</p>
        <p>According to Board 7, citing information from the Transit Authority, the expansion and renovation involves the installation of two wheelchair-accessible elevators, new stairs, lighting and floors, as well as the rearrangement of water, sewage and other lines. By November, the most disruptive above-ground work is scheduled to be completed and the holes completely covered. Below-ground work on platforms and the  station will continue until November 1999. Transit Authority officials were not available for comment.</p>
        <p>But the even more ambitious $22 million expansion of the West 72d Street subway station is to begin in November 1999, right around the time that the work on 66th Street is completed.</p>
