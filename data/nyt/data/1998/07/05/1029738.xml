        <p>ANY nominee who appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee these days can expect a lecture on the sins of ''legislating from the bench'' or ''making law instead of interpreting the law.'' Judges who believe otherwise ''should resign to run for public office -- at least then they would be accountable for their actions.'' So said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, a few weeks ago in a speech on the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>Across the street at the Supreme Court, meanwhile, the Justices were wrapping up a term that included a striking amount of what a disinterested observer might be tempted to call judicial legislating. That there has been no call for the Justices' mass resignation, from Senator Hatch or anyone else, indicates that beyond ritual political incantations about judges lies a separate, tacitly understood and widely accepted reality.</p>
        <p>Clarifying Vagueness</p>
        <p>By substantial majorities that cut across the ideological spectrum, the Justices in the term that just ended essentially rewrote the law of sexual harassment in the workplace, which is governed by, but nowhere described or even mentioned in, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They defined the scope of the attorney-client privilege, which Congress addressed only implicitly in Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. And the Justices effectively immunized police officers for the consequences of reckless high-speed chases, in lawsuits brought for constitutional deprivations under the ancient Civil Rights Act of 1871.</p>
        <p>Not everyone may have liked every result, but very few people who follow the Court could honestly profess to be shocked that there was lawmaking going on.</p>
        <p>While the Court's most noted role is to interpret the majestically open-ended and opaque phrases of the Constitution, about two-thirds of the docket consists of statutory cases. In deciding these, the Court routinely engages in what might be described as making law.</p>
        <p>It supplies the interpretive principles and the rules for practical application: Which side has what kind of burden of proof? What amount of evidence is sufficient? It decides how laws apply to situations that the Congress that passed them never anticipated. It reconciles internal contradictions. It fills in all-important statutory gaps attributable to Congressional neglect or, often, to deliberate omission in the face of political gridlock.</p>
        <p>If Justices stopped this kind of legislating from the bench, the system might grind to a halt.</p>
        <p>''It's driven by necessity,'' said Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a University of Pennsylvania law professor. ''We are living in an age of statutes with high political purpose that are broad on policy and rhetoric but weak on subordinate detail.''</p>
        <p>He said no institution other than the Supreme Court has both the credibility and the responsibility to fill in the blanks, adding of the Justices, ''What service would they really be performing for anyone if they talked at an equal level of generality?''</p>
        <p>It was, after all, John Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice, who declared in Marbury v. Madison in 1803 that ''it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.'' Still, there was  something quite noteworthy, even a bit unsettling, about how far the Court took the practice in the past term.</p>
        <p>In deciding two sexual harassment cases, based on a law that tells employers little more than ''thou shalt not discriminate,'' the Justices crafted and included in each decision an identical page of rules for establishing an employer's liability for the harassing conduct of a supervisor. The decisions went beyond defining sexual harassment in broadly prescribing how the legal system should handle such cases.</p>
        <p>Employers could be held liable even for conduct they were not aware of, and for conduct that did not cause any tangible job-related harm to the victimized employee, the Court said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it added an important qualification: If there was no harm, an employer could establish an ''affirmative defense'' against liability by having an effective anti-harassment policy in place, and by showing that the complaining employee unreasonably failed to invoke it.</p>
        <p>In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined only by Justice Antonin Scalia, complained about the Court's ''whole-cloth creation.'' But the tone of the majority opinion was not so much activist as pragmatic. The seven Justices in the majority, including Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, recognized that their own earlier, vaguely worded sexual-harassment decisions had failed to give lower courts the guidance to navigate a legal regime that was, after all, almost entirely judge-made.</p>
        <p>A Dialogue With Congress</p>
        <p>The Court had seen enough of confusion in the lower courts to know it was time to intervene, said Prof. Barry Friedman of Vanderbilt University Law School. And he called attention to what he said was an overlooked factor in supposedly free-handed lawmaking by the Justices: the Court's ''confidence that Congress can talk back.''</p>
        <p>''These opinions typically contain invitations to Congress, sometimes almost a tone of entreaty as if to say, here it is, here's our best shot, somebody had to do this, but tell us if we got it wrong,'' Professor Friedman said in an interview. The Court's statutory decision-making provides ''a unique opportunity for dialogue between Congress and the Court,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That a dialogue does take place is not just political science theory. When the Court changed course on civil rights in 1989, issuing a series of newly restrictive interpretations curbing Federal civil rights laws, Congress responded with the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which restored the legislators' original understanding of the laws and even added new teeth to some of them.</p>
        <p>Talking About Civil Rights</p>
        <p>Both Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter addressed that history in their majority opinions last month in the sexual harassment cases. They noted that Congress could have used the 1991 law to express disapproval of the Court's earlier sexual harassment decisions along with the other civil rights rulings, but did not do so, indicating that the Court was on the right track in having brought sexual harassment within the scope of Federal civil rights law.</p>
        <p>''In its day-to-day business, Congress is quite comfortable with the courts working out the details, as long as there remains a basis in the text,'' said Professor Michael Dorf of Columbia Law School.</p>
        <p>Ambiguous statutory language can itself be seen as ''a kind of delegation'' to administrative agencies and ultimately to courts, he said.</p>
        <p>For years, the Court has debated how closely, in interpreting statutes, to hold Congress to the plain meaning of the actual text, as opposed to gleaning whatever added information about Congress's intent might be available from the legislative record. Justice Scalia is the primary exponent of the ''textualist'' school -- still a minority view, but an influential one.</p>
        <p>Back Seat Driving</p>
        <p>On the surface, the textualist approach may convey the impression of passivity, of the Court taking a back seat to Congress. But in fact, it does not remove the Court from the business of lawmaking any more than any other approach to statutory interpretation; it allows the Court to ignore competing interpretations contained in the legislative or administrative record.</p>
        <p>''Scalia's focus on the text often means that it's the Court, and the Court alone, that is going to decide what the right answer is,'' Professor Dorf said.</p>
        <p>It's not likely that a future judicial nominee, after listening to a Senator's lecture about not legislating from the bench, will be tempted to counter with a paraphrase of Thomas Jefferson's ''We are all Republicans -- We are all Federalists.'' But in comparison to the standard homily, ''We are all judges -- We are all lawmakers'' might be closer to the truth of how the system actually works.</p>
