        <p>President-elect Andres Pastrana met the top leaders of Colombia's largest guerrilla force in an unannounced session today and came away pledging to remove security forces from five municipalities and start peace talks with rebel leaders within 90 days of taking office.</p>
        <p>In a brief press statement this afternoon, Mr. Pastrana said that he had met the leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, to deliver on his top campaign promise, a pledge to negotiate an end to nearly four decades of political violence in Colombia.</p>

        <p>President-elect Andres Pastrana met the top leaders of Colombia's largest guerrilla force in an unannounced session today and came away pledging to remove security forces from five municipalities and start peace talks with rebel leaders within 90 days of taking office.</p>
        <p>In a brief press statement this afternoon, Mr. Pastrana said that he had met the leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, to deliver on his top campaign promise, a pledge to negotiate an end to nearly four decades of political violence in Colombia.</p>
        <p>A brief videotape showed Mr. Pastrana shaking hands with leaders of the group, Manuel Marulanda and Jorge Briceno, at a location he described only as ''somewhere in Colombia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana became the first president to talk directly with the FARC leaders.</p>
        <p>Flying in a small plane under the auspices of the Red Cross, Mr. Pastrana, wearing a yellow polo shirt,  was flanked by the rebel leaders in camouflage uniforms.</p>
        <p>He said they had raised some ''worries'' over a 10-point peace plan in his campaign platform and expressed ''political willingness'' to hold a dialogue on ''the national problem of reaching peace with social justice.''</p>
        <p>But he declined to answer questions on the discussions, saying the peace process would require ''responsibility, seriousness and discretion'' on the part of Colombians.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Pastrana had pledged to meet the rebel leaders soon after winning the election June 21, the meeting today was a complete surprise, and it was carried out under extremely tight security.</p>
        <p>In recent days Mr. Pastrana's transition team had told reporters that he would be leaving for a few weeks' vacation in France, where his wife and children were waiting for him. Throughout the week officials like Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, whom Mr. Pastrana plans to name as Foreign Minister, avoided returning telephone calls, without explanations.</p>
        <p>Industrial, ranching and business leaders, who are among those hardest hit by guerrilla extortion, greeted  news of the meeting enthusiastically. ''Pastrana is fulfilling his election promises boldly,'' the head of the Ranchers Federation, Jorge Visbal,  said. ''It's an important step forward, which must be vigorously and enthusiastically consolidated.''</p>
        <p>A Colombian news magazine, Cambio 16, reported that the ranchers lost $70 million to the rebels last year.</p>
        <p>The ombudsman in the departing Government, Jose Fernando Castro, called the meeting ''a historic development without precedent'' and said it ''showed the will for peace of both the new Government and the FARC.''</p>
        <p>The rebel group is Latin America's oldest and most powerful, with intelligence estimates of its fighting capacity running from 10,000 to 15,000 combatants.</p>
        <p>The agreement of the group would be crucial to negotiating any lasting peace in this country of 36 million, which has lost more than 30,000 people to political violence since the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, the second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army, has been preparing for talks  next week in Mainz, Germany, with business and church leaders.</p>
        <p>Not to be outdone, one official, Environment Minister Eduardo Verano, told Colombian radio that two officials of the current Government would meet National Liberation Army leaders after they had finished preparatory talks with civic leaders.</p>
        <p>Leaders of FARC steadfastly refused to negotiate peace with the Government of President Ernesto Samper, which it calls illegitimate, and bolstered Mr. Pastrana's standing days before the election by meeting with his campaign chief, Victor Ricardo.</p>
        <p>In a strange post-election turnaround, a German couple who had spent two years in a Medellin jail for paying a ransom to the National Liberation Army now appear to be the shepherds of the peace effort.</p>
        <p>The couple, Werner and Isabel Mauss, had been accused by the police of colluding with the rebels. Mr. and Mrs. Mauss, however, said that they were on a mission to free a German executive's wife whom the rebels had kidnapped and that paying the ransom removed the largest obstacle to their country's being host to the talks between the rebels and the Government.</p>
