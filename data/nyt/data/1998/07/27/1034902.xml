        <p>Under pressure from hospitals demanding greater flexibility to compete, New Jersey and a growing number of other states have begun to lift restrictions on the kind of specialized services and new technology that hospitals can provide.</p>
        <p>Most states began imposing the restrictions two decades ago, mainly to hold down costs by limiting duplicative services at hospitals in the same area. The states required hospitals and other institutions to demonstrate a need in the community before expanding services like cardiac surgery and organ transplants.</p>
        <p>Now, with managed care squeezing costs out of the health care system, some hospitals say the restrictions are no longer needed. And some hospital officials say the regulations impede their efforts to compete aggressively for patients and for contracts with managed care companies looking for hospitals that can offer an array of services for their members.</p>
        <p>The effort to loosen the restrictions is opposed by many urban hospitals, which now offer most of the specialized services. They are concerned that allowing suburban and smaller community hospitals to offer many of the same services will jeopardize their financial standing because they are likely to lose some insured patients.</p>
        <p>For patients who live in suburban and rural areas, the changes could mean that they would get more specialized services at hospitals closer to home. But critics say the quality of care could be compromised at some of those hospitals if they do not have expertise in providing highly specialized services.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed legislation earlier this month that ends the requirement that hospitals win state approval to open pediatric and maternity wards and to expand other services like ambulatory surgery and magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
        <p>The new law, though, would continue to require state approval for some highly specialized services like cardiac surgery, organ transplants and neonatal intensive care while a new state commission studies whether state approval should remain mandatory in those areas.</p>
        <p>Thirty-seven states still require some approval of specialized services under what are known as certificate-of-need laws, and efforts to eliminate the review process failed in several of those states, including Georgia and Washington, this year.</p>
        <p>New York and Connecticut have maintained the state approval laws, but they have recently taken steps aimed at streamlining what hospital officials view as a cumbersome and costly approval process.</p>
        <p>Several states have ended the approval process. In Pennsylvania, the Legislature did not renew its certificate-of-need law in late 1996, allowing suburban and rural hospitals across the state to begin opening maternity wards and offering cardiac bypass surgery. North Dakota also rescinded its approval law. Ohio phased out its law this spring, setting off fierce competition among hospitals in some cities and towns over what services to provide.</p>
        <p>Supporters of certificate-of-need laws say that allowing hospitals to offer whatever services they want could jeopardize the quality of health care. They point to numerous studies that show quantity drives quality in some specialized procedures like organ transplants and bypass surgery. They say patients have better outcomes at hospitals that perform a high volume of such procedures.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe that the market is going to control unnecessary spending,'' said Suzanne Ianni, executive director of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, which represents mostly urban hospitals. ''The process now also recognizes the unlevel playing field between urban hospitals and other institutions. Many of the specialized services and technology are now at the urban hospitals, which brings in a suburban population to pay for those services. Paying patients help subsidize the other community services and coverage for the uninsured that urban hospitals now provide to a medically underserved patient population.''</p>
        <p>But opponents of the regulations say that patients who do not want to travel to big-city hospitals for specialized care should be able to find similar services closer to home.</p>
        <p>''It just does not make sense in today's market,'' said Valerie Sellers, vice president of health care planning at the New Jersey Hospital Association. ''Hospitals need more flexibility. They need to be able to respond to market forces. The process is too burdensome. It is too costly. To maintain a regulatory process that is that inflexible is not responsible in a competitive market.''</p>
        <p>In some states, for-profit hospital chains like Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation have been leading lobbying efforts to rescind certificate-of-need laws because the approval process often represents a barrier in breaking into the market.</p>
        <p>Ohio completed phasing out its state approval laws in March. As a result, community hospitals are now considering performing cardiac surgery, and for-profit hospital chains are moving in and building ''boutique'' hospitals that offer only cardiac and orthopedic surgical services.</p>
        <p>''We have had a real building boom,'' said Gretchen McBeath, a lawyer for the Ohio Hospital Association. ''We have seen it in a lot of areas, particularly ambulatory surgical centers and new hospitals. Another area that has exploded is obstetrics.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McBeath said that in towns with two hospitals, only one of the hospitals usually offered obstetric care, but that is changing.</p>
        <p>''We have had 14 new obstetrics services added, which is a lot,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. McBeath said there has also been a huge expansion in the number of kidney dialysis stations opened. When the state dropped its regulations governing the expansion of kidney dialysis stations in May 1995, she said state health officials estimated that about 59 new stations were needed statewide. Since 1995, Ms. McBeath said, 847 kidney dialysis stations have opened.</p>
        <p>''It can improve access,'' she said. ''But the other side of the argument is that you need to have a critical mass to guarantee quality.''</p>
        <p>To address concerns about the quality of care, New Jersey's new law would increase the state's oversight of new hospital services through stricter licensing procedures. Both Ohio and Pennsylvania have also imposed new rules to help protect quality of care.</p>
        <p>''We are no longer in the franchise business,'' said Daniel F. Hoffman, Pennsylvania's Secretary of Health. ''We are no longer in the business of saying, yes, you can, or you cannot, have open heart surgery. But if you have open heart surgery, you do have to follow our rules and regulations relative to quality and access. The rules cover everything from architectural design to staffing requirements to support services.''</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania has not seen the level of growth that some had predicted, although several suburban hospitals are now performing cardiac surgery, Mr. Hoffman said.</p>
        <p>Len Fishman, New Jersey's Health Commissioner, said the state  commission would consider the impact of a further lifting of restrictions on hospital services.</p>
        <p>''I think that one of the most important issues that the commission will consider is what any further exceptions would have on inner-city hospitals,'' Mr. Fishman said.</p>
        <p>Thomas R. Piper, director of the certificate of need program in Missouri and a former past president of the American Health Planning Council, said he thought that it was a mistake for states to lift all or most of their requirements, considering the billions of state and Federal dollars spent on health care.</p>
        <p>''As government increases its share of what is being spent, we have a situation here of some states reducing the amount of their input,'' Mr. Piper said. ''The certificate of need is one of the few ways that government and the public have a say in developing health care services.''</p>
        <p>But Daniel A. Kane, president of Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Bergen County, N.J., said that government cannot expect hospitals to be more competitive and then not give them the tools to compete. He said Englewood Hospital now has most of the services that it wants, except for cardiac surgery. He said the hospital is seeking state approval to offer that.</p>
        <p>''The barriers to entry oftentimes have little to do with quality or cost,'' he said. ''It really is a question of protecting existing providers from competition. We believe that quality can be protected, through licensing standards. And in a competitive marketplace, if you make a bad economic decision, you are punished for those decisions by the marketplace.''</p>
