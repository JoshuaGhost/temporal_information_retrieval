        <p>Despite the opposition of Republican leaders, the House tonight approved a measure requiring Federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives like birth-control pills for Federal employees.</p>
        <p>And to the distress of the Clinton Administration, the House eliminated money from next year's budget to fix the Year 2000 computer bug.</p>
        <p>The votes came as members of both parties, driven by election-year needs, ransacked one of the 13 spending bills that the Appropriations Committee had already approved.</p>
        <p>''It's a free-for-all,'' one top Republican aide lamented as morning slipped into evening and lawmakers postured unchecked by the normal rules that limit debate.</p>
        <p>House leaders had set special rules in an effort to block discussion of the contraception coverage -- a potentially risky vote that Republicans wanted to avoid because it could allow abortion rights advocates to portray them as extreme.</p>
        <p>The special rules allowed any lawmaker to throw out any unliked measure. House members jumped at the rare chance to score such easy political points and eliminated more than 50 sections from the 650 sections of the bill, which finances the Treasury and Postal Service for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1. The House approved the overall bill tonight by a vote of 218 to 203.</p>
        <p>Many members said they expected whatever havoc they wreaked today would be smoothed over when the House negotiated a final version of the bill with the Senate in the fall.</p>
        <p>In the 10-hour chaos that ensued on the House floor, members also knocked out money set aside to build courthouses around the country. And they approved paying $2 million to gun dealers who had ordered imported firearms that President Clinton later banned.</p>
        <p>The contraception coverage, introduced by Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, and passed by a vote of 224 to 198, was a rare success for abortion rights advocates. They hoped it would help counter the negative publicity that had plagued them since abortion opponents publicized a late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.</p>
        <p>Conservatives, led by Representative Mark W. Neumann, Republican of Wisconsin, eliminated the $2.25 billion that had been set aside to fix Federal computers' Year 2000 bug. Conservatives were worried that House leaders would not offset the spending and would thus exceed the maximum spending limits set by last year's balanced-budget agreement.</p>
