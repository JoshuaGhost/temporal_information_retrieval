        <p>I.B.M. replaced the executive in charge of its consumer personal computer business yesterday in an effort to turn around a division that has lagged even as the consumer market has shown steady growth.</p>
        <p>James A. Firestone, 43, who had headed the unit since August 1995, will leave to take a similar position at Xerox. In his place, the International Business Machines Corporation hired Michael Braun, the chief executive of Neuron Data, a software company.

        <p>I.B.M. replaced the executive in charge of its consumer personal computer business yesterday in an effort to turn around a division that has lagged even as the consumer market has shown steady growth.</p>
        <p>James A. Firestone, 43, who had headed the unit since August 1995, will leave to take a similar position at Xerox. In his place, the International Business Machines Corporation hired Michael Braun, the chief executive of Neuron Data, a software company. Mr. Braun, 48, spent more than 20 years at I.B.M. before being assigned to run Kaleida Labs, a joint venture by I.B.M. and Apple Computer to make multimedia software.</p>
        <p>''Firestone never got things going,'' said Gary Helmig, an analyst with Soundview Financial. ''The con sumer business had a good year in 1996, and it has been a drag ever since.''</p>
        <p>I.B.M.'s share of the consumer PC market fell from 12 percent at the start of 1997 to 3 percent last October, according to ZD Market Intelligence. Analysts attributed much of that drop to I.B.M.'s failure to foresee the rise of computers priced under $1,000. It has since added less costly models, and its retail share has bounced back to 16 percent. But it still trails Hewlett-Packard, with 24 percent of the market, and Compaq, with 22 percent, ZD says.</p>
        <p>Compaq and Hewlett-Packard have emphasized selling low-cost machines to the mass market. I.B.M., while focusing on higher-margin, feature-packed machines aimed at demanding, high-end users, has been wary of competing for market share in the volatile consumer market. But in a memorandum to employees announcing the appointment of Mr. Braun, David Thomas, the head of I.B.M.'s overall personal computer division, said the company's goal was to become the No. 1 seller of consumer PC's.</p>
        <p>When he joined I.B.M., Mr. Firestone was put in charge of an ambitious effort by the company's chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., to capitalize on I.B.M.'s brand recognition. In addition to computers, he was to introduce software, games and on-line products. Over the years, most of these consumer initiatives have been scaled back or closed.</p>
        <p>Before joining I.B.M., Mr. Firestone ran the home services unit of the Ameritech Corporation. Before that, he worked at American Express, with Mr. Gerstner and G. Richard Thoman, who eventually headed I.B.M.'s PC business. Mr. Thoman is now the chief operating officer at Xerox, which has been expanding its consumer marketing with products like small copiers.</p>
