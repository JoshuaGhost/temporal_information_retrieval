        <p>Ed Heins recalled a day last month when he had to take extra care getting into his car outside his Union Street home. ''I had to step over putrefied chicken guts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He and others who live near Lee's Live Poultry at 105 Union Street and Sing Wah Poultry Market at 114 Sackett Street say the markets have made life unbearable. At 6 A.M., trucks deliver crates of chickens that defecate on the sidewalk and spew feathers everywhere, they say, and workers wash chicken remains into  gutters and storm drains. On weekends, residents say, chicken carcasses and entrails are left in Dumpsters.</p>
        <p>''It smells like rotting flesh,'' said Jay Woodworth, who lives three doors from the Sing Wah market.</p>
        <p>After residents circulated a petition, Community Board 6 brought together city health, sanitation and environmental officials and a representative from the United States Department of Agriculture on Aug. 25. The board's assistant district manager, Robert Sanft, said the officials agreed to form a task force to do spot inspections of the markets.</p>
        <p>Since 1987, the city's Department of Environmental Protection has issued seven air quality violations against Sing Wah whose fines totaled  $1,175, an agency spokesman, Geoffrey Ryan, said. He said that in July inspectors ordered the market to reattach a grease filter that had been disconnected from a floor drain.</p>
        <p>Sanitation inspectors who visited the markets days after the August meeting found no violations outside the buildings, over which they have jurisdiction, the department said. A spokeswoman for the Health Department, Sandra Mullin, said the agency has not found a public health threat.</p>
        <p>Since both plants process more than 20,000 chickens a year, they are inspected daily by the U.S.D.A. George Puchta, district manager for the agency's food safety inspection service, said that when his inspectors follow up on complaints about chicken parts on the street, ''they invariably don't find any.'' He said inspectors are working with both markets to improve chicken-byproduct disposal.</p>
        <p>''There is certainly room for improvement,'' he said. ''But we don't consider them horrendous or a threat to public health.''</p>
        <p>Peter Lee, the manager of Sing Wah, said the Dumpsters, which are stored indoors, are emptied every morning except Sunday. He said the carting company did not operate on Saturday afternoon, when the market closes, or Sunday. The market, he added, has installed a trap to keep chicken fat and meat from clogging sewer lines. And he disputed claims that his workers wash pullet parts onto the street.</p>
        <p>No one from Lee's Live Poultry could be reached for comment.</p>
