        <p>A year after the Brazilian Government dismissed studies warning that parts of the Amazon rain forest were becoming so dry they could burn uncontrollably, fires have become a greater threat than ever to intact rain forest and to indigenous peoples, according to environmental groups that monitor the Amazon.</p>
        <p>The fires are set by ranchers and farmers to clear land for grazing and planting, but are burning out of control at an alarming rate, environmental groups say, due in large part to the drying effect of El Nino.</p>
        <p>The number of fires have more than doubled this year over last, according to the Government's own figures. Last year, 7,800 square miles of rain forest caught fire, the Woods Hole Institute in Massachusetts says.</p>
        <p>Until rains doused flames in Mato Grosso this month, they appeared set to ignite the Xingu National Park, which houses 5,000 indigenous people belonging to 17 tribes. In March, fires burned 2,379 square miles of rain forest in Roraima, including parts of the Yanomami Indian reserve, near the border with Venezuela.</p>
        <p>In addition, 10 percent of virgin rain forest, covering an area the size of California, is at risk of catching fire this year, according to the Environmental Research Institute on the Amazon, an independent group.</p>
        <p>Following the fires in Roraima, Government officials reversed their position, acknowledging that fires had indeed become a real threat. They created special teams to monitor burnings and fight fires, but environmental groups contend that the effort was too little too late. On Thursday, the World Bank announced a $15 million emergency project to fight the fires.</p>
        <p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has come under blistering criticism from environmentalists for putting off enforcement of Brazil's first Environmental Crimes Law, which was seven years in the making. Steve Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, called the order delaying enforcement ''a betrayal of everything the government negotiated for.''</p>
        <p>In July, the Government announced a $30 million plan to monitor burnings and create fire-fighting teams to control the fires during the burning season. But it has freed up only a small share of the money, said Joao Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary of the Socio-Environmental Institute. ''In reality, these projects had a lot of impact in the media, but very little impact on the ground,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Eduardo Martins, the head of the Government's environmental protection agency, rejected the criticism, accusing the environmentalists of ''climatic opportunism.'' He added, ''More than 1,000 people working on the problem doesn't signify doing nothing.''</p>
        <p>But, he said in a telephone interview, ''If you ask me if the prevention for this burning season was adequate, I'd say no,'' and he acknowledged that ''with the time that we had after the fires in Roraima, the preparation was not ideal.''</p>
        <p>The Amazon rain forest is home to the world's largest collection of animal and plant species, as well as troves of bacteria and fungi whose medicinal and nutritional value have yet to be studied.</p>
        <p>Naturalists had counted the new environmental law, which went into effect April 1, to be Brazil's most significant tool for protecting the environment. For the first time, it gave a Federal agency the authority to enforce environmental protection statutes, and forced companies to clean up pollution they had caused. Previously, some 94 percent of government fines were routinely thrown out by the courts.</p>
        <p>But last month, President Cardoso signed an executive order granting industry a 10-year protection from fines and criminal sentences for polluting if they pledge to remedy the problem. On Wednesday, President Cardoso modified the law once again, reducing the moratorium to a maximum of six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martins, the environmental protection chief, said he did not see the moratorium as a step backward. ''It's more a signal of maturity than anything else,'' he said.</p>
