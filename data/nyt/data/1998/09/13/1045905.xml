        <p>Q. I have rented from the owner and sponsor of a co-op for the last eight years. In April, the sponsor sent me a letter asking if I wished to renew my lease. In the past, he always sent a renewal lease, but this time, he only sent a letter asking if I wanted to renew. Since I was not aware whether the letter had any legal meaning, I ignored it and waited for the lease to arrive. The lease never came, and now the sponsor's lawyer has sent me a letter asking me to vacate the apartment. I have advised the sponsor that I am willing to renew my lease, plus any increase the sponsor is legally entitled to, but his reply is negative. My apartment is not rent-stabilized, but there must be some sort of protection for a tenant when a sponsor does not give proper notice. . . . Stewart Schulman, Manhasset, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that since the apartment is not regulated, there is no obligation on the part of the owner to renew the tenant's lease, even though the tenant is willing to accept a new lease and pay more rent. As a result, Mr. Brett said, the only protection the tenant has is contained in the state's Real Property Law as it relates to evictions.</p>

        <p>A. Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that since the apartment is not regulated, there is no obligation on the part of the owner to renew the tenant's lease, even though the tenant is willing to accept a new lease and pay more rent. As a result, Mr. Brett said, the only protection the tenant has is contained in the state's Real Property Law as it relates to evictions.</p>
        <p>''If the landlord does not commence an eviction proceeding in the month following the expiration of the lease,'' Mr. Brett said, ''he is required to give the tenant 30 days' notice to vacate the apartment before an eviction action can be started.''</p>
        <p>After a 30-day notice has been served and the eviction action has been started, he said, the tenant can appear in court and ask for time to find a new place to live.</p>
        <p>''The court has the ability at that time to extend the tenancy by as much as six months,'' Mr. Brett said, adding that since the landlord is using a lawyer for the eviction action, the tenant would probably have a better chance of getting the maximum amount of time to move if he also hired a landlord-tenant lawyer to represent him.</p>
        <p>Selling a House After a Fire</p>
        <p>Q. I recently had a fire at a house that I own and rent out. It was empty at the time of the fire. Can I sell the house, as is, without fixing it up? Or will doing this reduce the amount of insurance that I will receive? . . . Anthony M. DeVito, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>A. Andrew M. Schutzman, an insurance consultant in Rockville Centre, L.I., said it was indeed likely that selling the house as is would result in a reduction of the amount of money the letter writer would receive from his insurance carrier.</p>
        <p>''Most insurance policies are written on a replacement-cost basis,'' Mr. Schutzman said, explaining that with such policies, the insurance carrier covers the full cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the property. Generally speaking, however, to obtain full payment for repair or replacement, the repair or replacement must be completed.</p>
        <p>If, as the letter writer suggests, the property is sold without the repairs being done, Mr. Schutzman said, it is likely that the carrier will provide coverage for only the actual cash value of the damaged portion of the structure. Such coverage, he said, is computed by taking into consideration anything that would depreciate the value of the damaged property.</p>
        <p>So, for example, if the only part of a structure that was damaged was an eight-year-old roof, replacement coverage would provide whatever amount of money it would take to replace the roof with one similar to the original -- provided that the roof is actually replaced. If the roof is not replaced, however, the carrier would only provide coverage for the roof's actual cash value -- which would be the cost to repair or replace the roof, less depreciation for its age and condition at the time of the loss -- an amount that is almost always less than the actual replacement cost.</p>
