        <p>In an unusual move, an immigration judge handling the deportation case of a Palestinian accused of having links to terrorists has moved to force the man's former wife to disclose what she told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about him.</p>
        <p>Despite the opposition of immigration officials, the judge, Daniel Meisner, asked Federal prosecutors to seek a court order compelling the woman to testify.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian, Hany Kiareldeen, is a native of Gaza who has been in the United States since 1990 and has been detained since March by the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. He is one of about two dozen people in the country of Arab descent who, in an era of rising concern about domestic terrorism, are being detained or deported largely on the basis of secret information from unidentified informers.</p>
        <p>In such cases, which are rare among the 100,000 or so immigration hearings held annually, immigration officials cite national security concerns and are not required to disclose the details or the sources of the secret information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiareldeen's lawyers, who have seen only sketchy, declassified, summaries of the the secret information on file against their client, have maintained that his former wife, Amal Mohamed, is the source of the allegations that he has ties to terrorists. Regis Fernandez, one of the lawyers, said that the couple's divorce was bitter and that Ms. Mohamed has a history of vindictiveness and filing false charges against her former husband.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Fernandez subpoenaed her last month to testify at Mr. Kiareldeen's deportation hearing, Ms. Mohamed acknowledged in the early stages of the hearing that she had talked with Federal agents about her former husband, but she refused to say what she told them. When she testified that she was afraid and that her life had been threatened, the judge adjourned the hearing until Sept. 18.</p>
        <p>Immigration judges like Judge  Meisner do not have the power to cite witnesses for contempt as a way of compelling their testimony. Under an 18-month-old provision of the Immigration Reform Act, they have to ask Federal prosecutors to seek an order from a Federal District Court judge, who does have such power. Judge Meisner took that step on Wednesday after rejecting the arguments of lawyers for the Federal agency, who said that Ms. Mohamed's testimony should be limited in scope.</p>
        <p>Rick Kinney, a spokesman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the independent unit within the Justice Department that supervises the nation's 200 immigration judges, said Judge Meisner's request was the first effort by an immigration judge to compel testimony in this way.</p>
        <p>Lawyers with experience in immigration cases said most subpoenas issued by the judges were for documents and were directed at government agencies, which usually comply readily. Few could recall a recalcitrant witness at such hearings.</p>
        <p>Carol Wolchok, an expert on immigration law with the American Bar Association, said the new provision of immigration law under which Judge Meisner acted was intended to make immigration judges less dependent on the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Before the legislation was passed in 1996, she said, the judges were part of the agency and relied on it to enforce subpoenas and other orders. In this case, the agency opposes forcing Ms. Mohamed to testify.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the United States  Attorney's office for northern New Jersey confirmed that it had received Judge Meisner's request, but he declined to say what the office would do, especially in light of the opposition of another Justice Department unit, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
        <p>As for Ms. Mohamed, her lawyer, Jack Sachs, said he would oppose any action by a Federal judge to compel her to testify. Noting that Ms. Mohamed has expressed fears for her safety and that of her three children if she testifies, he said that should be enough for a judge to reject the order.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez said that in the weeks since Ms. Mohamed, who is also known as Amal Kamal, had refused to answer his questions he had uncovered police reports from Nutley, N.J., where the couple lived in 1995.</p>
        <p>Those reports say that she told officers responding to a report of a domestic dispute that Mr. Kiareldeen and his brother, Ghassan, were linked to terrorists, Mr. Fernandez said.</p>
        <p>The Nutley police passed along the allegations to the I.N.S. and F.B.I., according to the reports.</p>
        <p>Over time, Ms. Mohamed had filed a half-dozen charges against Mr. Kiareldeen, from abuse to assault, all of which were either dropped or dismissed by the courts, Mr. Fernandez said.</p>
        <p>''Our position is that the allegations of terrorist links are untrue,'' Mr. Fernandez said. ''But because it is secret evidence and classified, we have a due-process problem of determining who is making the allegations and questioning them and their credibility. Once we establish that she is the source, we can raise questions about credibility.''</p>
        <p>The sketchy F.B.I. summaries of the classified data on Mr. Kiareldeen, who has been held in a Mercer County prison for six months, allege that he threatened the life of Attorney General Janet Reno and met in his Nutley home with Nidal A. Ayyad just a week before the bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993. Mr. Ayyad was one of four defendants convicted in the attack.</p>
