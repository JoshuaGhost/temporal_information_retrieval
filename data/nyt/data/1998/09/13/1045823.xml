        <p>Anita Gates comment on Copenhagen as place where she suddenly likes herring, and as favorite destination on her travel wish list (special section, The Sophisticated Traveler) (part 2 of 2-part section) (S)</p>

        <p>I want to go back to Copenhagen, soon, and not just because there's an amusement park in the middle of town. Tivoli is a drawing card, of course. It has gardens, elegant restaurants, fireworks displays and a wooden roller coaster so old that no sane adult would board it unless he or she had had a few too many aquavits beforehand. (Of course, that sort of thing does happen.)</p>
        <p>Other strange things happen to me in Copenhagen, especially in restaurants. Suddenly I like herring. Suddenly it seems perfectly normal to spread mustard, rather than butter, on my bread. And I almost like beer. I want to go back to Copenhagen and practice saying ''skol'' properly (the vowel rhymes with the one in Ma and Pa, I'm told). I want to go back to the Hotel d'Angleterre at teatime to ask the waitress again for coffee and a Danish and have her ask, ''A Danish what?'' I want to have a leisurely dinner at 9 P.M. in June and take a walk afterward -- in twilight.</p>

        <p>In Denmark you're never more than 10 minutes away from a castle or at least from a Hans-Christian-Andersen-slept-here anecdote. If you ever looked at storybook illustrations as a child, you will have, I predict, visceral reactions to seeing the real-life moats and turrets and swans of fairy tales. I don't know why people keep knocking the head off the Little Mermaid's statue, but it's probably the single least interesting Andersen attraction anyway.</p>
        <p>Most important, though, I need to go back to Copenhagen's pedestrian shopping street, the Stroget, and get a ridiculously expensive down comforter. The one I had shipped home in 1985 is finally showing signs of wear, but it's still light as marshmallows, warm as toast. The Danes really know how to sleep.</p>
