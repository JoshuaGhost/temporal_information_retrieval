        <p>The police in 22 states and a dozen countries late Tuesday and early today swept down on scores of homes belonging to young and old, professional people and factory workers, all suspected of belonging to a huge Internet club trafficking in child pornography.</p>
        <p>Several dozen people were arrested, but officials said they expected more than 100 to be charged as law-enforcement officers with expertise in computers downloaded the contents of hard drives and disks that were seized.</p>
        <p>''The volume is enormous,'' Ray Kelly, the Commissioner of the United States Customs Service, said today, noting that the investigation had turned up a database of more than 100,000 sexual photographs of naked boys and girls, some younger than 2, some engaged in sexual acts with adults.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said the material went far beyond anything that could remotely be called art, and a British police official agreed.</p>
        <p>''It's stomach-churning,'' said Detective Superintendent John Stewardson, who led the British phase of the operation.</p>
        <p>Police officials in the United States and Britain called the operation one of the largest against the spreading netherworld of child pornography in cyberspace. The suspects were believed to belong to the Wonderland Club. A membership requirement, police officials said, was possession of pornographic photographs of children and a willingness to share them.</p>
        <p>The raids in the United States took place in places as diverse as Brooklyn, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Kennebunk, Me., West Orange, N.J., and Norcross, Ga. They yielded a half-dozen arrests and a treasure trove of computer equipment that will be used as evidence, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
        <p>One of those arrested was a University of Connecticut teacher seized at his home in New Britain, said an official familiar with the operation. Another raid, in Missouri, turned up a cache of weapons as well as child pornography in a heavily fortified trailer, this official said.</p>
        <p>The Customs Service, which coordinated the United States raids in connection with local authorities, did not release the names of the arrested. The accused face Federal child-pornography charges that could bring up to 10 years in prison, said a Customs agent, Bill Anthony. They could also face local charges, he said.</p>
        <p>In some instances, Wonderland Club members are believed to have posed their own children for pictures, Mr. Anthony said. In other cases, he said, parents may have taken money to let their children be used.</p>
        <p>What happened to the children is among the questions that investigators are agonizing over and will be for weeks as the inquiry unfolds, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said law-enforcement's knowledge of the Wonderland Club grew out of a 1996 investigation in San Jose, Calif. In that case, 16 people in the United States and abroad were charged with taking part in an on-line pedophilia club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly and Mr. Anthony said some implicated in the 1996 case cooperated with investigators. The information thus gleaned proved invaluable, especially when it was shared with British detectives, who earlier this year discovered pedophiles downloading child pornography.</p>
        <p>Over months of looking into the Wonderland Club, investigators learned how its members communicated by code and on some occasions were able to follow cybertrails, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anthony said the raids were timed to minimize the risk of Wonderland members' warning one another. They began around 5:30 A.M. today in Britain, when it was late Tuesday on the East Coast of the United States. Homes in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal and Sweden were also raided.</p>
        <p>Bob Packham, the deputy director general of the National Crime Squad in Britain, was pleased afterward, saying, ''I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled together so many law-enforcement agencies worldwide to effect simultaneous raids and arrests.''</p>
