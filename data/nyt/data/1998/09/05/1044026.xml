        <p>A Brooklyn block lined with auto repair shops becomes an open-air rehearsal studio for three competing orchestras. As dusk falls on Parkside Avenue, quick, trained hands strike rows upon rows of carefully tuned oil barrels, mallets are beat on rusty tire irons, and the warm summer nights fill up with the syncopated sounds of calypso.</p>
        <p>In the one corner of a shop where the roof has not yet collapsed from rain, a man who makes his living as a security guard constructs tall, baroque costumes out of cardboard and peacock feathers.  Nearby, teen-agers brought up on basketball and Biggie Smalls spend the evening mastering the steel-band songs of their Caribbean parents.</p>
        <p>A New World tradition is being remade once more in New York: the Caribbean heart of Brooklyn is getting ready for its annual late-summer Carnival, the city's biggest, most extravagant parade.</p>
        <p>On Monday morning, in the 31st annual West Indian American Day Carnival along Eastern Parkway from Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, schoolteachers and nannies will shed their workday clothes for skimpy thongs and dreamy costumes. The grandchildren of migrants from the American South will play steel drum with the children of Trinidadian immigrants. In a distinctly Brooklyn mix, Haitian rara bands with their goatskin drums will file among the tassa drummers, and mammoth trucks will roll down the Parkway, blasting soca and reggae.</p>
        <p>What began as a small, homespun celebration in Harlem in the 1930's has grown into a pageant surpassing older,  better-known processions like the St. Patrick's Day or the Puerto Rican Day parades -- a reflection of the surging immigration from the islands. Today, New York City is home to an estimated 600,000 Caribbean-Americans, the bulk of them in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But the growth of the parade, and its dozens of attendant parties, concerts and competitions, is more than a testament to rising Caribbean immigration. It is also a reflection of how many Caribbean immigrants who ignored, even snubbed, the rites of Carnival in Trinidad or Grenada have embraced it here, both as a way to recall the home they left behind and to keep their children in the Caribbean fold.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn's West Indian parade draws an estimated two million people, in comparison with the million or so who come out for the Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan. The city's Convention and Visitors Bureau now includes it on its list of Labor Day weekend attractions, and  New Yorkers with no ties to the islands come to watch and, increasingly, to don costumes in the masquerade bands, to play ''mas'' as it is called.</p>
        <p>In a nod to the political power of Caribbean New Yorkers, the parade has become a mandatory campaign stop. Banners pitching beer and long-distance telephone service now stretch along the parade route. And for the last three years, the parade has been broadcast live on local television, this year on WNBC, with a kind of cultural play-by-play by one of Trinidad's most prominent masquerade designers, Peter Minshall.</p>
        <p>The evolution of the parade also speaks volumes for how old-country rituals are reinvented, Brooklyn-style.</p>
        <p>Yvonne Barnes, 60, a transplanted Trinidadian whose children and grandchildren now join her on Eastern Parkway, likened the Brooklyn parade to a tasty fruit-flavored drink. ''With the grapyness,'' was how she put it, ''but not the grape.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, carnival scholars and revelers say, the Brooklyn parade is in many ways a different kind of concoction altogether. For one thing, it is an American-style march, not a series of free-floating processions as in  Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, where this Carnival was born. To accommodate television, the parade here must stick to a  schedule, and marshals must keep dancers from veering off the route.</p>
        <p>''Oh, they used to be extremely careless about scheduling,'' recalled  Major R. Owens, the United States Representative from Crown Heights who made his first appearance at the parade 18 years ago. ''It was supposed to start at 11 o'clock, and it wouldn't start till 1.''</p>
        <p>Since then, considerable effort has been made to bring the parade in line with a tighter schedule, install portable toilets and police barricades, and garner corporate donations.</p>
        <p>But the growth of the parade has also sown dissension between the organizers and some of the band leaders, particularly over how to pay for this phenomenally expensive affair. The West Indian Day Carnival Association, the organizer, says the weekend-long bacchanal now costs nearly a half-million dollars; for some of the bigger masquerade bands, like the 1,000-member Hawks International, the costumes and sound equipment necessary for a few hours on the Parkway cost $50,0O0. This year, organizers expect 30 such bands.</p>
        <p>While the city does not estimate the parade's economic impact, there are a few budding efforts to use the Carnival as an engine of economic development. Una Clarke, the City Councilwoman from Crown Heights, for instance, has proposed a program to generate year-round jobs for the Carnival costume-makers. Mr. Owens is seeking to build a Caribbean-American cultural museum with an office for parade organizers.</p>
        <p>Corporations with an interest in the Caribbean-American market have begun to capitalize on the parade, with companies like Western Union, AT&amp;T and Mobil sponsoring some of the larger masquerade bands as well as the parade itself. ''It's relevant to our target audience, and we want to be part of it,'' said Anthony Smith, the Mobil Corporation's manager for diversity marketing and community relations.</p>
        <p>The parade has also fueled the resurgence of another Trinidadian rite. For the last several years, Trinidadians hankering for less structure and more steel bands have turned to a free-spirited predawn pageant called J'ouvert, which since slavery times has been a venue for drums, dance and social commentary.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, J'ouvert -- a French-derived term pronounced joo-VAY and loosely translated as ''I open,'' as in the opening of Carnival -- has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few years. It now draws about 50,000 people to a parking lot behind the Brooklyn Museum, but so far, no politicians. Amplified music is  barred, leaving only the peals of the steel pan to break the cool silence of the night.</p>
        <p>For J'ouvert this year, Tricia Mayhew and her friends will slather themselves from head to toe with red paint and dance under the stars. Ms. Mayhew, a 27-year-old high school science teacher, has joined the parade on the Parkway ever since she left Trinidad, 11 years ago. But she has not played J'ouvert like this since she was a child.</p>
        <p>''Catching all those faces and listening to the steel bands, you get that original feeling,'' she said. ''We've gotten so commercialized now. But to watch these musicians play these notes, you just marvel. You feel a sense of more freedom.''</p>
        <p>If the growth of Carnival is a function of a conventional immigrant narrative -- doing in this country what one did at home -- the opposite is also true. Many have delved into the rites of Carnival only after leaving home.</p>
        <p>As a Catholic school student in Trinidad, Kathy Clarke was allowed only a glimpse of the masquerading revelers at Carnival time. She never covered herself in paint on J'ouvert morning. And she would never have been caught in the neighborhood pan yard, whiling away her evenings with the pan men -- and it once was only men -- who were considered ''hooligans,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Now, both her college-age son and daughter play steel drum. And Ms. Clarke, a middle school teacher from East Flatbush who moved to New York in 1979, serves as sort of a den mother for their band, the Invaders. She joins her children as they play pan on J'ouvert morning and then rushes home to change into costume for the parade.</p>
        <p>''People tell me this -- you're lucky you can keep kids in the culture,'' she said the other day, as her daughter, Dominique, 20, practiced on a six-headed bass drum in the backyard of an East Flatbush preschool.</p>
        <p>If parents look to steel band as a way to keep their children ''in the culture,'' the music now also fills a void in neighborhoods where sports, arts and other recreational programs for young people have all but dried up.</p>
        <p>On a recent Sunday evening, the  pan yard of the Sesame Flyers steel band in Flatbush was bustling. Bass drums were spray-painted gold. The chrome tenor drums were rubbed  until they shone. Later in the evening, they would play on Church Avenue, and people would pour out of their hot apartments to stroll and listen.</p>
        <p>Teen-agers now form the core of many bands in Brooklyn. Roots-seeking may be important to their parents, but the young people are drawn to the pan yard by other things. They come so they can stay out with friends long past their curfew. They come because they feel safe, because the pan yard, they say, is like family. Mostly, they come for the music.</p>
        <p>Anthony (Mike) Patten, the captain of the Sesame Flyers, remembered when the steel pan first pulled him in. Even though his father played pan as a young man in Belize, Mr. Patten discovered it only serendipitously. He was a sophomore in high school back then, and he was giving rides to a neighbor who played pan at a youth center on Flatbush Avenue. ''The energy was amazing,'' he said, his eyes lighting up at the memory. ''It was kind of infectious.''</p>
        <p>It was infectious enough to bring Mr. Patten, now 25, back to Brooklyn after college in Connecticut. It is also apparently infectious enough to draw  teen-agers to the pan yard every  night of the week, until well past midnight, all summer long -- and to give up every Friday and Saturday night during the school year as well.</p>
        <p>Kelvin Browne, 16, has been playing for nearly seven years, often riding the bus for a half-hour each way to get his hands on a tenor drum.</p>
        <p>''Something got stuck on me,'' he said. ''Having something to play, having fun, hanging out. In the end, it's worth it.''</p>
