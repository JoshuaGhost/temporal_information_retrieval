        <p>A mother of six, living in poverty and estranged from her husband, called 911 on Thursday night, the police said, and made a shocking statement: she had killed her children.</p>
        <p>Police officers and paramedics rushed to her apartment and found the bodies of three girls and three boys, ages 5 to 11. The woman, Khoua Her, 24, was lying inside the doorway wearing a fancy red dress. The body of one of the children was behind her.</p>
        <p>The woman was in custody at Region's Hospital here. The medical examiner's office said the children had been strangled.</p>
        <p>In the call to 911, the woman had spoken about suicide. But it was unclear whether she had harmed herself.</p>
        <p>As a 13-year-old girl, Khoua Her was paired with her husband in an arranged marriage in her native Laos, neighbors said. When her babies started to arrive, they came almost every year, six of them altogether.</p>
        <p>Minnesota is a center for the Hmong, refugees from Laos who have long struggled economically. But the police and civic officials were careful to play down any notion that such a horrific event had any cultural underpinnings.</p>
        <p>The police had been called to the apartment at least 15 times in the last 18 months for domestic turbulence.</p>
        <p>Calling the deaths ''very, very tragic,'' Chief William Finney of the St. Paul Police said: ''We see this across cultures. It doesn't matter what culture you're from, American or otherwise.''</p>
        <p>The family lived in a two-story housing project, which is racially and ethnically mixed.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, there was a hush and a somberness among adults and children who could not quite believe what had happened.</p>
        <p>Not long after the deaths, more than 150 people gathered outside Thursday night. A voice called out for respect, pleading, ''Can we get a moment of silence for these six angels that's gone?'' The Star Tribune reported.</p>
        <p>In recent months the woman's husband, Tou Hang, had left the apartment, and she had been dating another man, neighbors said. One neighbor said she saw Ms. Her ''scoop up the kids'' and chase them inside when he came to call recently.</p>
        <p>Chief Finney acknowledged the many police visits to the apartment for domestic violence, but said, ''There was never any indication the children were in this kind of danger.'' Police records show at least eight calls to the apartment since January.</p>
        <p>Mai Xiong, a friend of the woman's new boyfriend, told reporters that the mother loved her children, but that she had regretted marrying to young.</p>
        <p>The friend she Ms. Her was ''depressed over the amount of responsibility she had.''</p>
        <p>She told The Star Tribune: ''She basically missed out on all her teen-age years. She wanted to have fun.'' She added, ''I always thought of her as kind of odd, but I didn't think this would ever happen.''</p>
        <p>A neighbor, Christopher Yang, said the parents had taken turns taking care of the children. He described the mother as ''someone who was not really taking care of her kids,'' saying that she would sometimes leave the apartment without taking them.</p>
        <p>The children were scheduled to return to school next week.</p>
        <p>Minnesota has long been a center of resettlement for refugees, largely because of the work of Lutheran Social Services and other religious organizations. Thousands of refugees from Somalia have settled in Minneapolis in recent years.</p>
        <p>The Hmong have had a difficult time in America. Most are poor and illiterate, and street gangs have been growing among their young people. Arranged marriages are common in the Hmong culture. In general, the Hmong people do not mix very much among other cultures.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said the family had lived in St. Paul for several years.</p>
        <p>Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul described the deaths as ''a tragedy of overwhelming proportion,'' adding, ''We're all shaken, the community is shaken.''</p>
        <p>The police identified the dead children as Kouaeai Hang, 11; Samson Hang, 9; Nali Hang, 9; Tang Lung Hang, 7; Aee Hang, 6; and Tang Ke Hang, 5.</p>
        <p>The apartment building was roped off with yellow police tape today, and few of the children played in the playgrounds.</p>
        <p>''There's usually a lot of kids playing,'' said Sade Kelly, 12. ''Now it's kind of empty.''</p>
