        <p>A donor who asked to remain anonymous has offered to arrange payments totaling $1 million to the fan who catches the 62d home run ball by Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa to help in the continuing search for justice in the 1980 murders of three American nuns and a lay worker in El Salvador.</p>
        <p>''I want to raise awareness,'' the donor, a longtime baseball fan, said yesterday in a telephone interview, ''and what better way to publicize the cause than to tie it to the home run derby? I hope when sportscasters talk about the money, they'll also talk about the case.''</p>

        <p>A donor who asked to remain anonymous has offered to arrange payments totaling $1 million to the fan who catches the 62d home run ball by Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa to help in the continuing search for justice in the 1980 murders of three American nuns and a lay worker in El Salvador.</p>
        <p>''I want to raise awareness,'' the donor, a longtime baseball fan, said yesterday in a telephone interview, ''and what better way to publicize the cause than to tie it to the home run derby? I hope when sportscasters talk about the money, they'll also talk about the case.''</p>
        <p>The donor, who says he wants to protect his identity because he fears for his safety, will buy a $650,000 annuity that will pay the fan $50,000 annually for 20 years. His plans are to resell the ball, and any profits above $650,000 will go to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that represents the victims' families and promotes human rights around the world.</p>
        <p>If there is no profit, the donor has guaranteed to make a $75,000 donation. He said he would make the same donation even if the fan declined to sell the ball and gave it to McGwire or Sosa or donated it to the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>The donor said he had followed the case and was particularly outraged that two Salvadoran officers implicated by a United Nations Truth Commission report for covering up the murders were never prosecuted, and live in Florida.</p>
        <p>In 1984, four Salvadoran National Guard members and their immediate superior were convicted of the murders and sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Recently, three of the five were released. The Truth Commission found that Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia and Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, the two officers now living in Florida, organized and directed the cover-up.</p>
        <p>Last April, the four former national guardsmen said they acted only after receiving ''orders from above.'' They made their admissions during interviews with R. Scott Greathead and Robert Weiner, members of the Lawyers Committee.</p>
        <p>''These officers -- you can't prove they ordered the murders, but they covered it up, and now they're living comfortably,'' the donor said. ''Everybody I talk to is outraged by all this.''</p>
        <p>The donor approached the Lawyers Committee on Thursday, and the committee spent yesterday investigating him and his ability to pay for the annuity.</p>
        <p>''He's what he says he is,'' Great head said. The donor's lawyer is Elaine Wood of Kroll Associates, a private investigation and security firm. She said the donor's background and finances checked out ''affirmatively.''</p>
