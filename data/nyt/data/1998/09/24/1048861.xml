      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial scores Congressional Republicans for adding to various bills measures to deny United States funds to international family-planning groups that use other money to pay for abortions or abortion counseling</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Republicans are inviting President Clinton's vetoes by attaching odious gag rules on international family-planning groups to various bills. For his part, the embattled Mr. Clinton would probably welcome the opportunity to remind most Americans that he stands closer to their views on reproductive rights than do his political opponents.</p>
        <p>In April, Congress attached the offensive language to the State Department authorization bill that approved payment of most of the delinquent dues America owes to the United Nations. If some portion of the U.N. arrears, which now exceed $1.5 billion, is not paid by the end of the year, the United States will lose its voting rights in the General Assembly. The failure to pay also threatens to undermine American influence in the Security Council on sensitive issues like Iraq and Kosovo. Last week the House attached a similar gag rule to its foreign operations appropriation bill.</p>

        <p>In April, Congress attached the offensive language to the State Department authorization bill that approved payment of most of the delinquent dues America owes to the United Nations. If some portion of the U.N. arrears, which now exceed $1.5 billion, is not paid by the end of the year, the United States will lose its voting rights in the General Assembly. The failure to pay also threatens to undermine American influence in the Security Council on sensitive issues like Iraq and Kosovo. Last week the House attached a similar gag rule to its foreign operations appropriation bill.</p>
        <p>The Republicans want to resurrect curbs on the activities of international family planning groups that existed under the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Longstanding Federal law prohibits American Government funds from being used to perform or promote abortions in other countries. But the Reagan and Bush Administrations went further, barring such funds from going to foreign organizations that used other money to pay for abortions or to counsel patients on abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton rightly reversed this policy. But the Republican-controlled Congress has been trying hard to undo his decision. Going even further, conservatives led by Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey want to ban international groups from lobbying foreign governments on abortion laws even with their own money.</p>
        <p>Republicans have proposed allowing the President to waive the prohibition against foreign groups that perform abortions with money that does not come from Washington. But such a waiver would automatically result in a cut in total American population planning aid. A cut would perversely increase abortions, since family planning is the most effective way to reduce abortions.</p>
        <p>No waiver, however, would be allowed on the anti-lobbying ban, which is the more insidious provision since few international organizations that seek population aid from the United States perform abortions anyway. The rule would prohibit these groups from sponsoring workshops on abortion issues, distributing materials or making public statements that call attention to defects in a country's abortion laws.</p>
        <p>This undemocratic rule would require nongovernmental organizations to silence themselves in legitimate political debate over reproductive rights in their own countries. President Clinton should veto  legislation that would punish free speech abroad.</p>
