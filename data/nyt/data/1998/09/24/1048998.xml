        <p>If ever a pair of Beckett clowns were made for each other, it would have to be the Vladimir and Estragon who run amok in Joy Zinoman's hip new staging of ''Waiting for Godot.''</p>
        <p>Played by a pair of elastic and dynamic actors, Thomas W. Jones 2d and Donald Griffin, they're so merrily in sync that it's easy to see why they hang out together in perpetuity, waiting at the appointed time and place for someone who never comes. (With a White House itself in perpetual crisis, waiting seems a particularly apt stage metaphor in Washington these days.)</p>
        <p>In fact, in Ms. Zinoman's liberty-taking and immensely enjoyable production, Godot is practically superfluous. Who needs the intrusion from that metaphysical no-show? Didi and Gogo, as they're more familiarly known, are happy to keep themselves occupied with their own skills as performers, even if their performance space is as experimental as they come: the middle of nowhere.</p>
        <p>The added value is that you'll be entertained, too. While they're unable to avoid the occasional lapse into cuteness in this revival by Ms. Zinoman's Studio Theater, Mr. Jones and Mr. Griffin are agile showmen, the kinds of resourceful physical performers who can get a laugh with a gesture even when the words don't always hold up. They play Beckett's heroes as a pair of dancing fools, distinct from one another and yet bound so tightly it's impossible by the play's end to think of one without the other. They beautifully execute a central theme of this work, that regardless of outward circumstances, one's existence has no meaning unless it is validated by someone else.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zinoman, the longtime artistic director of the Studio Theater, a 20-year-old subscription playhouse located off 14th Street N.W., just north of midtown, infuses her ''Godot'' with an up-to-the-minute urban sensibility. The play begins with a few jazzy notes on a saxophone; the black actors who play the leads -- the supporting roles of Pozzo and Lucky are portrayed by whites -- perform bits of hip-hop and, in the kinds of improvisations that would have driven Beckett up the wall, embellish the text with caustic asides, resort to black slang and even flirt and banter with the audience. ''What's wrong with white people?'' Mr. Jones ad libs in mock-irritation at one point, when he fails to elicit the desired response from the crowd.</p>
        <p>The actors charm their way through most of it, but making ''Godot'' interactive leaves some questions for the continuity department: Are Didi and Gogo alone on that barren landscape? Or are we out there with them? Either way, this is a ''Godot'' that means to explore the relationship between the entertainer and the entertained. The pleasingly simple set by Russell Metheny suggests the symbolic edge of America's vast cultural wasteland: Didi and Gogo hold their vigil on a bare tract behind a drive-in movie screen so big it blacks out the sky, and the actors wear a trace of white makeup around their mouths, hinting at their own theatrical backgrounds.</p>
        <p>You could imagine this Didi and Gogo one day in side-by-side rocking chairs in an old-age home for over-the-hill hoofers; in the meantime, they derive pleasure (and kill time) doing bits of stage business, deftly juggling turnips, for instance, or running through Abbott-and-Costello-style comedy routines. The warmth between them grows as the actors explore the nooks and crannies of their companionship, and the dimensions of their mutual admiration and dependence take shape. Mr. Griffin is the stockier, earthbound yin to Mr. Jones's lighter-than-air yang: the rounder of the pair is sadder, more reflective, the taller more carefree and frenetic.</p>
        <p>Their felicitous bond, of course, is in bold contrast to the perverse master-slave relationship of Pozzo (Michael Tolaydo) and Lucky (Hugh Nees), who cross paths with Didi and Gogo for no particular reason at all. Mr. Tolaydo's self-infatuated Pozzo is a distant relation to the puffed-up Master Thespian character Jon Lovitz used to play on ''Saturday Night Live,'' and Mr. Nees's Lucky, tethered, as always, to the rope Pozzo controls, deftly navigates a course between hapless prisoner and beast of burden.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. Jones and Mr. Griffin not been such attractive headliners, Mr. Nees might have walked away with the play. His slobbering, stuttering declamation of Lucky's long, run-on speech, consisting entirely of non-sequiturs, is a show-stopper, funny and at the same time utterly pathetic. It's the best of Beckett, a lover of both words and the grotesque, and Mr. Nees's nimble rendition makes the spoken aria an event unto itself.</p>
        <p>Showing off, after all, is what this production celebrates, and the only drawback is that once the actors finish with all the riffing, they have no recourse, no bridge to the play's darker dimension.</p>
        <p>Everything is so show biz that the poignancy of Didi and Gogo's lonely plight, the echo of the tragic element in all of human life, has no chance to sink in. There's a feeling as the less satisfying second act winds down that something deeper in the play has been glossed over.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Zinoman and her excellent players have performed a vital service, liberating ''Waiting for Godot'' from the airlessness and pretension that often afflict productions of Beckett. The Studio Theater revival is an enthusiastic vote in favor of a great playwright's lasting relevance.</p>
