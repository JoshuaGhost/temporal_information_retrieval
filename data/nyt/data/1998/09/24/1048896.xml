        <p>In New York City's second death penalty trial since the state revived capital punishment three years ago, a Brooklyn woman testified yesterday that she saw the defendant shoot a man down the block from her apartment and then fire four or five more shots after a second assailant ripped a gold chain and pendant from the victim's neck.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In New York City's second death penalty trial since the state revived capital punishment three years ago, a Brooklyn woman testified yesterday that she saw the defendant shoot a man down the block from her apartment and then fire four or five more shots after a second assailant ripped a gold chain and pendant from the victim's neck.</p>
        <p>Fighting back tears, the witness, Debra Williams, gave her account of what prosecutors have contended was the execution of Marvin Naquan McIntosh, 28, during a street robbery in the East New York section of Brooklyn on the night of May 22, 1996.</p>
        <p>''He fired once at first,'' Ms. Williams said of the defendant, Jermaine Page, 24, who lived in Ms. Williams's building. She testified that she had witnessed the fatal confrontation through a window of her fifth-floor apartment in a building overlooking the scene, on Georgia Avenue between Blake and Sutter Avenues.</p>
        <p>She said that Mr. McIntosh, whom she knew through a girlfriend of his who lived on the Georgia Avenue block, ''looked like he wanted to take a few steps'' after being hit by the first bullet.</p>
        <p>Next, she said, she saw the second man ''snatch something from his neck.'' And then, Mr. Page ''started shooting again,'' Ms. Williams said, adding that she heard ''four or five'' shots at that point.</p>
        <p>But during a vigorous cross-examination of Ms. Williams, whom the prosecution has indicated is a major witness in the case, a defense lawyer attacked the credibility of her testimony by suggesting that she could not have seen the events she described from her window.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Gary S. Villanueva, also suggested that she had developed her account because she thought it would help her gain leniency in a prosecution for possession of crack cocaine that had been pending against her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams denied those suggestions, as well as another by Mr. Villanueva that she had sought to deceive the police in connection with the drug case by using her sister's name when she was arrested in that case in 1992.</p>
        <p>The defense held in its opening argument last week that Mr. McIntosh, a Staten Island resident who worked for a private mail delivery service, was killed not in a robbery but rather in a dispute over a dice game, and that the person who fired the fatal shots was not Mr. Page but a teen-ager named Darryl Gilmore, then 15.</p>
        <p>When he announced in late 1996 that he would pursue the death penalty if Mr. Page was convicted of the first-degree murder charges against him -- rather than the alternative of life in prison without possibility of parole -- the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, did not say why he had made this decision other than that he had reviewed the ''aggravating and mitigating factors'' in the case.</p>
        <p>Although an intentional killing during a robbery is one of the types of killings eligible for execution by lethal injection under the 1995 law restoring capital punishment in New York State, legal experts say that prosecutors have not generally pursued capital punishment for defendants charged with such slayings.</p>
        <p>But a possible element in Mr. Hynes's decision was hinted at by one of the trial prosecutors, Barry M. Schreiber, a deputy district attorney, when he described Mr. McIntosh's killing to the jury as an execution.</p>
        <p>In the state's first death penalty trial under the 1995 law, also in Brooklyn, a former jail guard, Darryl K. Harris, was convicted in May of the execution-style killings of three people in a robbery.</p>
        <p>In June, the same jury sentenced Mr. Harris to death.</p>
