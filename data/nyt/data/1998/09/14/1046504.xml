        <p>During three hours of play today at the Oakland Coliseum, there had been senseless, ill-timed Giants penalties, missed Giants tackles, blocking blunders and another unproductive rushing performance by the team -- not to mention the ignominy of giving up an 80-yard touchdown run on the game's first play from scrimmage.</p>
        <p>And yet, as much as the Giants were floundering against the Oakland Raiders, the score was tied midway through the fourth quarter, and with that the Giants had at least an equal chance to win.</p>

        <p>During three hours of play today at the Oakland Coliseum, there had been senseless, ill-timed Giants penalties, missed Giants tackles, blocking blunders and another unproductive rushing performance by the team -- not to mention the ignominy of giving up an 80-yard touchdown run on the game's first play from scrimmage.</p>
        <p>And yet, as much as the Giants were floundering against the Oakland Raiders, the score was tied midway through the fourth quarter, and with that the Giants had at least an equal chance to win.</p>
        <p>Then, with the Raiders facing a third-and-26, the Giants watched as Raiders quarterback Jeff George threw a 26-yard pass to his tight end Rickey Dudley, down the middle of the field and through the heart of the Giants defense.</p>
        <p>First down Raiders, even though there had been three Giants near Dudley.</p>
        <p>Later, after the Raiders had rallied for a 20-17 victory, several Giants referred to the third-and-26 play as the moment that was most indicative of what ailed the Giants today.</p>
        <p>''Our defense isn't supposed to give up a first down on a third-and-26,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''That's not us. But that's the problem. It just shows you we're not as good as we think we are.''</p>
        <p>Around the Giants locker room in the wake of their defeat, the overriding sentiment was that these 1998 Giants (1-1) had failed to prove that they are any more mentally tough than the 1997 version of the team, which had also opened its season with a home victory and then flunked the first road test on its way to a 1-3 start.</p>
        <p>Today, Giants Coach Jim Fassel didn't like that way of thinking, and it moved him to promise his players after the game that changes in the lineup might be necessary. It moved the players to question the maturity of the team.</p>
        <p>''How many Jacksonville games do we have to have before we learn?'' Giants safety Percy Ellsworth asked, referring to the Giants' second loss last season and to a disturbing preseason performance this year. ''We talk about All-Pro players and you hear new contract talk, but we ain't that good, period.''</p>
        <p>Fullback Charles Way, who may be the most respected member of the team, said: ''We weren't focused today, and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. People just aren't concentrating.''</p>
        <p>With a difficult 1998 schedule that includes five 1997 playoff teams, the Giants had hoped to stockpile victories early in the season when they faced teams that have met with less success. The Giants had put the Raiders, who lost their season-opening game last week and who won just four games a year ago, in that category.</p>
        <p>But when Greg Davis's 26-yard field goal split the uprights with 1 minute 58 seconds to play today, giving the Raiders the 20-17 lead, and when a last-minute Giants drive proved futile, the Giants said they had learned something.</p>
        <p>''Basically, we aren't good enough to start thinking we can beat anybody,'' Way said. ''We came here thinking we were doing all right. Things aren't all right.''</p>
        <p>Way's teammate Michael Strahan added: ''This is a great example of looking at the schedule and thinking about the games you think you should win.''</p>
        <p>The defeat also revealed some of the Giants' consistent weaknesses this year, specifically an unimpressive offense.</p>
        <p>The Giants gained just 233 yards today, and only 71 rushing. A year ago, they were the league's seventh-best rushing team.</p>
        <p>Today's rushing performance had Fassel talking of changes when the Giants meet the Dallas Cowboys next Monday. Fassel said running back Tyrone Wheatley, who has been inactive for the last two weeks, might see action.</p>
        <p>''We didn't come here today ready to fight to win the game,'' Fassel said. ''We were not a mentally tough football team today. I'm disappointed with how we played on both sides of the ball.''</p>
        <p>Giants quarterback Danny Kanell, who led the team on a last drive that fell 30 yards short of field-goal position, said the Giants could not sustain a rhythm.</p>
        <p>''We never felt in sync,'' said Kanell, one of the few Giants who played well, completing 23 of 33 passes for 188 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. ''I don't know why.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' only lead in the game was early in the third quarter when Kanell threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Chris Calloway.</p>
        <p>The touchdown came one play after the Giants had apparently tied the score at 10-10 on a 42-yard field goal by Brad Daluiso. But Oakland's James Folston was called for holding on the field-goal attempt, a penalty the Giants accepted because it gave them a first down.</p>
        <p>Kanell went for the touchdown on the next snap, throwing the ball behind Calloway in the corner of the end zone. Calloway made a brilliant adjustment on the ball, catching it before Oakland cornerback Eric Allen even knew Kanell had released the ball.</p>
        <p>The Giants' lead was short-lived. Less than four minutes later, the Raiders led by 17-14 when George lofted a 22-yard pass over Giants cornerback Conrad Hamilton and into the hands of the All-Pro receiver Tim Brown.</p>
        <p>A 43-yard field goal by Daluiso with 50 seconds left in the third quarter tied the score.</p>
        <p>The Giants trailed 17 seconds into the game when Napoleon Kaufman burst through the middle of the line on the first play from scrimmage and raced 80 yards, virtually untouched, into the Giants end zone.</p>
        <p>Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead, who was clearly hampered by the ankle he sprained last week, fell down on the play, and Giants safety Tito Wooten also missed his chance to trip up Kaufman.</p>
        <p>The Giants, however, recovered quickly from the stunning beginning to the game, responding with an 8-play, 77-yard touchdown drive to tie the score at 7-7.</p>
        <p>The developing rapport between Kanell and wide receiver Ike Hilliard, who had 8 receptions for 78 yards, was on display in the drive as the duo connected on an 18-yard play and a 10-yard touchdown pass.</p>
