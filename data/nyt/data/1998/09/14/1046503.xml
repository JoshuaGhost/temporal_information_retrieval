        <p>Dallas had come here to Mile High Stadium this afternoon to reaffirm its playoff position. Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, was the ultimate measuring stick. The Broncos took the measuring stick and whacked Dallas over the head with it -- repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Denver unleashed a brutal offensive attack, with quarterback John Elway throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for one, and running back Terrell Davis rushing for 191 yards and 3 touchdowns on 23 carries.

        <p>Dallas had come here to Mile High Stadium this afternoon to reaffirm its playoff position. Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, was the ultimate measuring stick. The Broncos took the measuring stick and whacked Dallas over the head with it -- repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Denver unleashed a brutal offensive attack, with quarterback John Elway throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for one, and running back Terrell Davis rushing for 191 yards and 3 touchdowns on 23 carries. The Broncos scored touchdowns on their first five possessions on the way to a 42-23 victory over the overmatched Cowboys before a crowd of 75,013.</p>
        <p>Even more painful for the Cowboys was the loss of quarterback Troy Aikman, who fractured his left collarbone in the second quarter after a scramble to pick up a first down. It is a major setback for a former championship team that was trying to climb back into contention this season under a new coach.</p>
        <p>''I hate to use the word devastating,'' Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey said. ''It does hurt our football team. He's an all-time great football player. You don't lose an all-time great football player and have it not hurt your team. We just have to go on.''</p>
        <p>Elway also left the game with an injury, grabbing the back of his right leg and limping after rolling out for a pass to receiver Ed McCaffrey midway through the fourth quarter. Elway pulled his hamstring and is listed as day to day. He said he would not work for three or four days, which means he will miss practice on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Denver, traveling to Oakland next week, raised its record to 2-0 and is riding high. Dallas, which visits the Meadowlands next Monday night to play the Giants, is in trouble. The Cowboys will have to go against the Giants with their backup quarterback, Jason Garrett. The bad news is that Garrett is no Aikman, a 10-year veteran who has guided the team to three Super Bowl championships in the 1990's. The good news is that Garrett is 2-0 in games he has started in place of Aikman.</p>
        <p>Garrett played well while filling in for Aikman today, completing 14 of 19 for 113 yards and guiding Dallas to three scoring drives (all field goals by Richie Cunningham). But the Cowboys were trailing by 28-14 when Aikman went out, and they could not dig themselves out of that hole.</p>
        <p>Aikman injured himself trying to keep a drive alive. He had rushed for 3 yards on the previous play because all of his receivers were covered. Aikman was forced to run again on the next play and he took off, running toward the right sideline. He saw Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski coming over but managed to dodge him and pick up an additional 4 yards.</p>
        <p>Denver defensive end Neil Smith said he thought Aikman was going out of bounds and he pulled up for a second until he realized that Aikman wasn't. Instead of going out of bounds or sliding, Aikman went down on his side and landed on his shoulder. Smith and Denver defensive end Marvin Washington landed on top of him.</p>
        <p>''I thought I could get a few more yards, but then I landed on my shoulder,'' Aikman said. ''This is just one of those freak injuries.''</p>
        <p>Aikman emerged from the locker room before halftime with the X-ray results showing the fracture, and all hope of a shootout with Denver evaporated. The way the Broncos' offense was playing this afternoon, the Dallas offense from those Super Bowl teams would have had trouble keeping up.</p>
        <p>''They spread us out,'' Dallas strong safety Darren Woodson said. ''We had a matchup problem in the first half and they had a great game plan. With our standard package in there, we couldn't match up. We just didn't make good adjustments. I wasn't prepared to see that.''</p>
        <p>Dallas running back Emmitt Smith, who rushed for 93 yards on 20 carries, admired Davis's work in the backfield.</p>
        <p>''He ran the ball flat and gave it back to us,'' Smith said.</p>
        <p>Davis scored twice on back-to-back possessions on runs in which he cut back to the left and was untouched by the Dallas defense. The first scoring run was 63 yards and the second was 59.</p>
        <p>Every time the Dallas defense looked up, Davis was running past it, Elway was zipping a pass through it or tight end Shannon Sharpe was splitting a seam. (Sharpe finished with 6 receptions, 97 yards and 2 touchdowns.)</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I've ever seen a team go five series and get five touchdowns in the first half,'' Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said. ''Using four wide receivers and a tight end on third down allowed us to spread the field out and give John some targets.''</p>
