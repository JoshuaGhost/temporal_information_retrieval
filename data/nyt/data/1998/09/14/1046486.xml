        <p>Now the Jets get to see what life is like when they are expected to win and don't.</p>
        <p>In multiple ways that they had not shown during the Bill Parcells era, they messed up on offense, defense and special teams today. That was too much of a triple handicap to overcome, and so the Baltimore Ravens handed them a 24-10 defeat.</p>
        <p>It dropped the Jets' record to 0-2, a start reminiscent of those teams from what now seems another era, but was only a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Glenn Foley threw three interceptions, one returned by the old-timer Rod Woodson for a 60-yard score. Another interception positioned a field goal.</p>
        <p>''Well, he'll find out about being an N.F.L. quarterback now,'' Parcells said of Foley's resiliency.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the special teams were burned for a 69-yard punt return by Jermaine Lewis on the second kick by Brian Hansen, who was playing golf in South Dakota on Friday when Parcells suddenly summoned him to replace the rookie Nick Gallery.</p>
        <p>But if there was a symbol of the Jets' frustration today, it belonged to the offense, which could not get Curtis Martin into the end zone on three cracks from the 1-yard line. Over all, he had the ball four straight times once the Jets got to the 3.</p>
        <p>His failed fourth-down effort from 24 inches out, with the score tied at 7-7, spoiled a drive that had consumed more than half of the second period. The Jets had tied the score on a 4-yard pass from Foley to Keyshawn Johnson, who outmuscled the shorter DeRon Jenkins, and another touchdown would have put the Ravens in a hole.</p>
        <p>Instead, Eric Zeier came in to quarterback the Colts for the sore-fingered Jim Harbaugh. The Ravens had 99 yards to go, but Zeier's first pass was a 39-yard completion to Michael Jackson over Otis Smith. It immediately lifted the Ravens out of trouble, and they went on to score a touchdown.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be a long week for us,'' Foley said. ''This is going to tell us a lot about this team.''</p>
        <p>If there was rampant fan optimism before this game, it was understandable. The Jets were going into their home opener after having taken the mighty 49ers to overtime last week. More than 70,000 fans were on hand, with thousands of them celebrating hours before game time. Giants Stadium (the Jets simply call it the Meadowlands) looked like the world's biggest outdoor barbecue. Youngsters were throwing footballs, music blared from car radios, the smell of hot dogs cooking filled the air.</p>
        <p>But the mood was quickly deflated. The offense never mounted much of an attack, or certainly one with any consistency.</p>
        <p>Martin is one of football's finest runners. But in two games with the Jets, he has been more dangerous as a receiver. Against the 49ers, Martin was held to 58 yards on 22 carries. Today, the Ravens, as expected, used similar tactics in launching what often seemed to be nine men at the line when he had the ball. The result: 58 yards on 23 rushes. Martin was the club's only runner today.</p>
        <p>Martin caught six more passes today for 60 yards, and the Ravens seemed content to allow him his 10-yard receiving average. But they were able to prevent his cross-the-grain running, his darting to the hole that appears for an instant, his commanding presence that keeps drives alive with defense-tiring, wearing running.</p>
        <p>Why are the Jets having so much trouble getting Martin going?</p>
        <p>Parcells, who said last week that pass receptions have to be counted to gauge Martin, backed off that somewhat.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in this league has a hard time running the ball against that kind of defense,'' he said. ''They had a hard time running the ball, too.''</p>
        <p>Say this for the Jets. They did not give up trying to run, even while down by 17-10 midway through the final quarter. But after a pair of failed Martin runs, Foley threw the ball toward fullback Jerald Sowell. As if on cue, the 33-year-old Woodson appeared, stepped in front of Sowell and produced the crushing score.</p>
        <p>That final touchdown punctuated a game of Jets mistakes. Yet, on the game's opening score, it appeared the Jets were about to put the Ravens in a hole.</p>
        <p>Hansen took the snap on a quick count from his own 23. It surprised the Ravens' special teams, Ray Lucas said.</p>
        <p>''I got the jump on the guy and I was the first one down there,'' Lucas said. Indeed, he was at Lewis's heels virtually the moment the dangerous returner hauled in the kick.</p>
        <p>''But he shook me off,'' Lucas said. With that first fake, Lewis suddenly had a clear road. No one got close enough to bother him in his 69-yard romp to a touchdown. Only a few weeks ago, he generated a 97-yard punt return for a touchdown in preseason play. So this was no surprise to the Jets.</p>
        <p>''No surprise at all,'' said Chris Hayes, one of the better special-team players in the league. ''He's a good returner, and we've just got to get better.''</p>
        <p>As for Smith, beaten on the 39-yard pass to Jackson by Zeier, it was this simple: ''I got beat. He got behind me. It was one of those things that happened.''</p>
        <p>But nothing hurt worse than Martin's inability to score with four cracks starting from 3 yards out. Martin said he had no explanation, and Parcells defended his decision not to go for a field goal.</p>
        <p>''If you can't make that play, you've got trouble,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And that is exactly what the Jets had today.</p>
