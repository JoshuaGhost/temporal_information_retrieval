        <p>As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani walked for 13 blocks at the head of the West Indian American Day Carnival yesterday, he was greeted with boos and catcalls, signs blasting his handling of Saturday's rally in Harlem and a man on a bicycle who tried to ride into his entourage.</p>
        <p>All in all, the Mayor said, not a bad reception. ''Have you been to one of these before?'' Mr. Giuliani asked a reporter. ''This wasn't as bad as last year. Everything is relative. The amount of booing last year was greater. There was more cheering this year.''</p>

        <p>As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani walked for 13 blocks at the head of the West Indian American Day Carnival yesterday, he was greeted with boos and catcalls, signs blasting his handling of Saturday's rally in Harlem and a man on a bicycle who tried to ride into his entourage.</p>
        <p>All in all, the Mayor said, not a bad reception. ''Have you been to one of these before?'' Mr. Giuliani asked a reporter. ''This wasn't as bad as last year. Everything is relative. The amount of booing last year was greater. There was more cheering this year.''</p>
        <p>A cool response at the annual parade is indeed nothing new for the Mayor. He was roundly booed last year in the wake of charges that a Haitian immigrant was brutally assaulted by police officers in the 70th Precinct. He was booed at the 1995 parade, two weeks after 28 churchgoers, many of them immigrants from the Caribbean region, were hurt in a clash with the police at a church in South Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>Most of the parade watchers along Eastern Parkway ignored the Mayor as he walked by. And some who shook his hand expressed reservations afterward.</p>
        <p>''He's done a good job,'' said Mark Evelyn, an accountant from Barbados who has lived in East New York for 13 years and who shook the Mayor's hand. ''I feel a lot safer now, but I think he overreacted a little bit in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Evelyn's remarks echoed the views of many West Indian Americans.</p>
        <p>About seven blocks into the parade, the police said, Justin Wilson, 21, of the Wingate section of Brooklyn, crashed his bike into the Mayor's escort detail. He was charged with reckless endangerment.</p>
