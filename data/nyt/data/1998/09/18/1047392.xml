        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 13 Week in Review article on mandatory community service requirements in the Chicago school system highlights some of the problems with this plan but offers few alternatives.</p>
        <p>Today, only 15 percent of all schools  require that students do any public service. If every student were allowed to write a major report on civic duty in lieu of performing community service, schools would be much more likely to add a civic requirement to their curriculums. Moreover, giving students this option would eliminate the legal problems involved in requiring direct community service.</p>
        <p>If all schools had a civic requirement, students would become much more imbued with the ethic of community service, and this army of new activists would provide huge social benefits where the need is greatest.</p>
        <p>THOMAS O'BRIEN  Charlottesville, Va., Sept. 15, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is director of research, Horizon Institute for Policy Solutions.</p>
