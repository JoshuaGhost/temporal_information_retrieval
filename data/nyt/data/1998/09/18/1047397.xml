        <p>In a major challenge to President Clinton's export policy, House and Senate negotiators agreed today to shift the control over exporting American satellites back to the State Department from the Commerce Department.</p>
        <p>Some space experts and a senior Government auditor have said controls on exports of satellites to China have been loosened since the Administration transferred licensing authority to the less restrictive Commerce Department in 1996, possibly compromising national security. The Commerce Department denied this.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, more than 10 House and Senate committees are investigating whether this approach has contributed to the release of sensitive satellite technology and engineering know-how that may have helped China improve the reliability of its long-range missiles.</p>
        <p>The investigations were first prompted by the disclosure that in 1996, American companies helped the Chinese figure out what went wrong with a Chinese rocket that exploded while carrying an American satellite. This unauthorized assistance prompted a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>The issue became caught up in the campaign finance debate this year when it was disclosed by The New York Times that nearly $100,000 was funneled into the Democratic Party in 1996 through a Chinese aerospace executive who was also an officer in the Chinese military.</p>
        <p>Last February, the President ignored objections from prosecutors and approved the launching of another American satellite on a Chinese rocket.</p>
        <p>Concerned about these revelations, Congress proposed returning authority for licensing satellites to the State Department, which historically has been much more cautious than the Commerce Department.</p>
        <p>Senior Administration aides have threatened a White House veto if Congress shifted the licensing authority over satellites. At a Senate hearing today, senior Defense, State and Commerce Department officials urged lawmakers to keep the current system. William A. Reinsch, the Under Secretary of Commerce for export administration, warned in an interview that putting the State Department in charge would delay the licensing process, and put American satellite companies at a competitive disadvantage with foreign rivals.</p>
        <p>''This will hurt American companies with no national security benefits,'' Mr. Reinsch said.</p>
        <p>He said Commerce Secretary William M. Daley would again urge Mr. Clinton use his veto.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton's troubles from the Monica Lewinsky scandal have weakened his support on Capitol Hill, and it was unclear today whether Democrats would sustain a White House veto.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the licensing provision is included in the Pentagon's $271 billion budget bill for the 1999 fiscal year. Given the growing concerns that American combat readiness is eroding and top-quality troops are leaving in large numbers, vetoing the military's budget bill would carry huge political risks for the President.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the White House seemed to be pulling back from its veto threat, even though Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser, played a central role in placing the Commerce Department in charge of licensing satellites in 1996. Mr. Berger was the deputy national security adviser at the time.</p>
        <p>David Leavy, a White House spokesman, said, ''We've made no decision whether to recommend whether the President veto the bill.''</p>
        <p>One State Department official said, ''It's hard for us to fall on our sword over this.''</p>
        <p>The satellite provision is part of legislation hammered out reconciling the House and Senate versions of the Pentagon financing measure and requires full House and Senate approval. That could come as early as next week.</p>
        <p>The provision would transfer the licensing jurisdiction over commercial communications satellites to the State Department, effective March 15, 1999.</p>
        <p>Satellites would be returned to the so-called munitions list, the inventory of the nation's most sensitive military and intelligence-gathering equipment.</p>
        <p>As an added safeguard, the President would have to certify that the export of missile equipment or technology, including satellites, would not hurt the American space-launching industry and would not indirectly and measurably improve China's missile or missile-launching expertise.</p>
        <p>Republican lawmakers applauded the transfer.</p>
        <p>''This change reflects the sentiment that the Clinton Administration has fallen down on the job, and we need to do a more effective job of controlling'' technology that has both commercial and military uses, said Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican who has held several hearings on the matter.</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican who heads a select House committee investigating technology transfers to China, also cheered the decision. But Mr. Cox noted that after an American company received a license to transfer sensitive technology, like supercomputers, to China, ''there is precious little follow-through.''</p>
        <p>Senate Democrats reluctantly agreed to the deal, but only after watering down or eliminating several of the more extreme conditions the House included in its version of the bill. The House, for example, had voted overwhelmingly to ban all satellite exports to China.</p>
        <p>''There's no effective difference between Commerce and State, except that State takes forever'' to process license applications, said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin said the provision required the State Department to come up with a plan for an orderly and timely process to deal with license applications.</p>
        <p>If Congress approves the jurisdiction transfer and Mr. Clinton signs the bill, the process will revert back to what had been in place until 1996.</p>
        <p>The Administration had switched jurisdiction to the Commerce Department largely at the behest of several major American satellite makers, who argued that with the end of the cold war, satellites should be treated more as commercial products than military devices.</p>
        <p>In late 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided against relaxing export controls over the shipment of satellites to China, where they could be launched more cheaply than in the United States.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berger argued that Mr. Christopher had failed to properly consider the interests of the White House or American businesses seeking trade with China. Ultimately, Mr. Berger engineered a deal that stripped the State Department of its broad licensing authority.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and his top national security aides insisted that the new procedures under the Commerce Department did not relax export controls or threaten national security.</p>
        <p>But the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, disagreed. With the State Department in charge, for example, the Pentagon effectively had a veto over satellite exports. Under the new procedures, the Pentagon had one vote among five Federal agencies and had to persuade a majority to stop an export. The new rules allowed for a three-step appeals process for an agency opposing a satellite export.</p>
