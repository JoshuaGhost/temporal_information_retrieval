      <abstract>
        <p>Letter by Marilyn Hoder-Salmon, director of Women's Studies at Florida International University, says Monica Lewinsky's behavior is an indication of either low character or desperation, particularly in an affluent and educated woman of the 1990's (Katie Roiphe Op-Ed article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Katie Roiphe (Op-Ed, Sept. 15) writes that using one's sexual power to advance in the world is a ''time-honored female tradition.'' Consequently, there is ''nothing inherently wrong'' in Monica S. Lewinsky's apparent efforts to trade sexual impropriety for professional advancement. In contrast, I consider such behavior an indication of either low character or desperation.</p>

Consequently, there is ''nothing inherently wrong'' in Monica S. Lewinsky's apparent efforts to trade sexual impropriety for professional advancement. In contrast, I consider such behavior an indication of either low character or desperation.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Ms. Roiphe should read ''The House of Mirth'' again. Contrary to her implication, Lily Bart desperately seeks a way not to use her beauty or have others use her beauty to secure a safe harbor for herself. But had Lily acquiesced to rely on sexual power to escape poverty, I could far more understand this survival tactic in a woman of the 1890's than in an affluent and educated woman of the 1990's.</p>
