        <p>The Middlesex County Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Marvin Shuster, who is dying of cancer and is being allowed to testify by videotape in seven murder trials, has become too ill to continue the tapings, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Judge Barnett E. Hoffman of Middlesex County Superior Court ruled in July that Dr. Shuster, who is not expected to survive the trials, could provide his testimony by videotape. Dr. Shuster's illness worsened after providing taped testimony in two cases last month, and he has been unable to continue, prosecutors said.</p>

        <p>The Middlesex County Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Marvin Shuster, who is dying of cancer and is being allowed to testify by videotape in seven murder trials, has become too ill to continue the tapings, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Judge Barnett E. Hoffman of Middlesex County Superior Court ruled in July that Dr. Shuster, who is not expected to survive the trials, could provide his testimony by videotape. Dr. Shuster's illness worsened after providing taped testimony in two cases last month, and he has been unable to continue, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Thomas Kapsak, an assistant Middlesex County prosecutor, said he planned to have other medical experts review Dr. Shuster's evidence and present it at trial in the five remaining cases. While the change in expert witnesses is not expected to completely damage the prosecution's cases, Mr. Kapsak acknowledged that Dr. Shuster would have been the best witness to establish cause of death in the remaining cases, a crucial element in proving that murder was committed.</p>
        <p>Robert Obler, a lawyer handling two cases affected by Judge Hoffman's ruling, said Dr. Shuster's inability to testify would not affect his defense efforts. Anthony Iacullo, another lawyer handling a case affected by the ruling, said he had not yet decided how to handle the change in witnesses.</p>
