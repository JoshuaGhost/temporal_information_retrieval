        <p>When Brendan Fitzgerald, a tourist from Massachusetts, arrived in Peggy's Cove earlier this week, it was still known mainly as the most visited, most admired old fishing village on Nova Scotia's craggy east coast -- necklaced by great white rocks, serenaded by crashing surf and crowned by a red-tipped lighthouse worth driving hours to see.</p>
        <p>With the watery smashup of Swissair Flight 111 during the night, just five miles away, the 60 or so souls here woke up today in a different hamlet, one whose carefree tourists had been driven out by fire engines, television vans and sober emergency crews.</p>
        <p>''It's such a pleasant place,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''It's amazing how a blanket of sadness can suddenly cover a place.''</p>
        <p>Sadness with a hint of horror. From the rounded rocks where tourists gaze to sea, the vista today included Her Majesty's Canadian Ship Preserver, a naval supply vessel whose cargo increasingly consisted of debris and passengers' remains, its freezers turning rapidly into a mass morgue.</p>
        <p>To and from the big ship shuttled the Coast Guard cutters and humble local lobster boats that were still scouring the swells for flotsam and jetsam from the plane. Though officials had said by daybreak that there had been no survivors of the crash, rescue workers said they still held out hope of finding someone alive.</p>
        <p>But in the main, the jobs of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board and other rescue workers numbering in the hundreds consisted largely of fishing out tiny bits of luggage, stray shoes, body parts and occasional whole bodies. In nearby Dartmouth, at a Canadian military base, rescue workers began to assemble a makeshift morgue in an airplane hangar in preparation for the platoons of corpses soon to come.</p>
        <p>In Peggy's Cove itself, the sadness was mixed with a touch of the surreal: the abnormal absence of the crowds of ocean-gazers on the rocks, and the edicts of the emergency workers, like the ban on children playing in the schoolyard because it was needed as a helicopter landing spot. Tourists arriving today were barred from the village, which is normally one of Canada's most popular destinations, and the prevailing tone of Peggy's Cove seemed turned from light to dark in a kind of anti-holiday.</p>
        <p>On a house's back stoop high above the protected cove for which the village is named, onlookers watched somberly today as boats that normally disgorge lobsters or sunburned whale-watchers puttered in with cargoes of shoes or a baby backpack in forensic-looking plastic bags.</p>
        <p>''It seems like Peggy's Cove has stopped,'' said Darrell Fralick, 26, the attendant at the town's main parking lot. He had been awakened at 2:30 A.M. to open the public washrooms in the lot for use by the news-media and emergency crews flocking in, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's really sad,'' said Tara Gabriel, Mr. Fralick's fiancee and an attendant at the art gallery across the street from the parking lot. ''This doesn't happen in Peggy's Cove's backyard.''</p>
        <p>Her fiance agreed: ''You hear about things like this, but when it hits in your backyard you can feel how other people feel.''</p>
        <p>''They all have families,'' said  John Thomas, who patrols the rocks of Peggy's Cove to keep tourists from endangering themselves as they clamber.</p>
        <p>''They all have people at home waiting,'' Mr. Fralick added.</p>
        <p>''Imagine going to the airport to meet someone and the flight doesn't come in,'' Ms. Gabriel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas continued: ''You only see a sign saying 'See agent.' ''</p>
        <p>Such sympathy, expressed universally hereabouts, is nonetheless only sympathy, not grief; Peggy's Cove did not lose any of its own people -- a loss that would be deeply felt in a village dominated by a handful of families, most of them here since the place was founded in 1811.</p>
        <p>There were no tears to be seen here today, as victims' identities became known in only a trickle and the victims themselves remained largely names without faces. Almost all the recovered bodies were being taken to a navy ship, not to shore here.</p>
        <p>But there was concern closer to home as well. At least one fisherman from Peggy's Cove, John Campbell, participated with dozens of colleagues from nearby in the ghastly work of gathering up bodies and debris from the sea.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen anything like that in my life, and I hope I never do again,'' Mr. Campbell, a red-headed man of 34, said quietly and matter-of-factly, back on the wharf at Peggy's Cove.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Campbell and dozens of other veteran lobstermen, fisherman and small boaters from the coves and villages south of Halifax who, in the first, horrible hours of the rescue effort, rushed to form the vanguard of the search for survivors. Some residents expressed concern for the physical, and psychological, safety of those fishermen during their ordeal.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Richard E. Walsh, who ministers at the only church in this town of 60 people, St. John's Anglican Church, said that even hardened fishermen were having trouble dealing with the scope of the disaster.</p>
        <p>''This is a fishing village,'' he said. ''The people here know about tragedies. They know what the sea can do.'' But he added: ''Some of the men are very, very upset. It's quite traumatic.''</p>
        <p>Some also expressed dismay that there was never a chance to rescue anyone, here in a region where the rough Atlantic often plunges ships into distress, and where daring rescues at sea are a proud tradition.  Roger Crooks, a lobsterman, said he had considered taking his boat -- which lacks the lights to run at night -- out to help with rescues this morning, but by daybreak, word had come that there were no survivors.</p>
        <p>''For a lot of people,'' said Gordon Earle, a Member of Parliament whose region includes Peggy's Cove, ''The hardest thing was that there was no one they could save.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle was walking the winding streets of Peggy's Cove, he said, because he wanted to show his support. ''It's quite traumatic for a community to have this tragic disaster take place right there in the community,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And, said Eliza Manuel, chairwoman of the Peggy's Cove Commission, which oversees local land use, ''It's scary to think how close the crash was to all of us here -- minutes or seconds in the air.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Manuel's father, John Beale, proprietor of Beales' Bailiwick, a crafts store specializing in Canadian work, provided some sage perspective on the strange day.</p>
        <p>This morning, an announcer on the all-news radio station CJCH had commented that the little village ''certainly takes on a different meaning from the time you were there with your family enjoying the beauty of Peggy's Cove.'' Mr. Beale said that some reporters had asked him whether its association with tragedy could damage Peggy's Cove, much as the village of Lockerbie in Scotland is now synonymous for many people with the 1988 crash of Pan American World Airways Flight 103.</p>
        <p>''They ask, 'Will the Cove ever be the same?' '' he said. ''They say, 'Will people stay away forever?' ''</p>
        <p>But in fact, Mr. Beale said, given the public's penchant for sad, gory stories like the sinking of the Titanic, Peggy's Cove would most likely not be shunned for its association with catastrophe. Rather, he said: ''It will probably be the reverse. It's a sad dialogue on society but it's true.''</p>
