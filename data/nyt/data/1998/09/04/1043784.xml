        <p>Bonds continued to benefit from the turbulence in stocks yesterday, managing a modest gain.</p>
        <p>Investor demand for United States Government securities recently, especially for the shorter maturities, has been tied to the rise and fall of the nation's and overseas stock markets. With stocks down yesterday,  still in reaction to the unresolved economic crisis in Russia and turbulence in the global financial markets, bonds were up.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to 103. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was down to 5.30 percent, from 5.33 percent on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The bond market was poised for the release of the August jobless report today. Analysts forecast a gain of 370,000 new jobs last month.  One estimate was even higher, calling for a gain of as many as 500,000 new jobs.</p>
        <p>The Department of Labor released its weekly report on first-time applications for jobless benefits yesterday for the week ended last Saturday. The data rose only slightly, indicating that the labor market was still tight. Claims were up 1,000, to  302,000. The four-week average of claims -- which economists consider  more reliable -- fell to 302,250, its lowest level in a year.</p>
        <p>Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said: ''The long and the short of it today is that bonds are trading inversely to the Dow.</p>
        <p>''As for the August employment data being released on Friday, I have no apprehension about the number. I think that all of the positive factors have been factored in at these market price levels.''</p>
        <p>Keeping in mind what happened to stocks, he is being cautious about bonds: ''I get a little apprehensive when I hear analysts say bonds are going to go up in price. It makes me a little nervous. That's why I think any surprise in the employment numbers tomorrow could just as easily be a negative for Treasuries. The only reason the bond market traded higher today is because of the turmoil in the equity markets.''</p>
        <p>Bonds were further bolstered in the afternoon by late buying linked to the Moody's Investors Service downgrading of Brazil's foreign currency debt rating to B-2 from B-1.</p>
