        <p>Whenever Derek Jeter's name is announced, whenever he gets another pivotal hit or whenever he makes another slick fielding play, the reaction is much different than it is for other Yankees. For others at Yankee Stadium, there are roars. But for Jeter, there are squeals. They escalate as if Jeter were a singer with the Backstreet Boys.</p>
        <p>The young fans, especially young girls, marvel at Jeter. They adore him because he is young and handsome, because he plays shortstop for the Yankees and because he chats with fans from the on-deck area.</p>

        <p>Whenever Derek Jeter's name is announced, whenever he gets another pivotal hit or whenever he makes another slick fielding play, the reaction is much different than it is for other Yankees. For others at Yankee Stadium, there are roars. But for Jeter, there are squeals. They escalate as if Jeter were a singer with the Backstreet Boys.</p>
        <p>The young fans, especially young girls, marvel at Jeter. They adore him because he is young and handsome, because he plays shortstop for the Yankees and because he chats with fans from the on-deck area.</p>
        <p>Do not let the squealing obscure how important Jeter is to the Yankees. Even the smartest baseball scout might squeal after watching Jeter play. It sounds cliche, but the 24-year-old Jeter keeps improving every day. It is not cliche to reason that Jeter is as valuable a player as the record-setting Yankees have.</p>
        <p>Of course, that raises another question. If Jeter is the most valuable Yankee -- and it probably is either Jeter or Bernie Williams during this special season -- could the shortstop also be the most valuable player in the American League? It is an arduous question because there are several worthwhile candidates, like Williams, Boston's Nomar Garciaparra or Mo Vaughn and Texas' Juan Gonzalez. Still, Jeter definitely belongs in this discussion.</p>
        <p>''Everyone would love to be the m.v.p.,'' Jeter said. ''I think a lot of guys on this team could be m.v.p. We have a lot of guys who have done well this season. Regardless of what your numbers are, we have a lot of guys having great seasons.''</p>
        <p>Usually, Jeter handles questions about personal accomplishments the way he might react to swallowing vinegar. He looks at his feet, utters something about not being perfect until he bats 1.000 and makes no errors and shifts the focus to the Yankees. Jeter has been this modest since his 1996 rookie season.</p>
        <p>But Jeter embraced a discussion about the m.v.p. long enough to thrust support behind his type of player. While not necessarily pushing himself for m.v.p., Jeter argued that the award should not simply be given to a player who has the gaudiest numbers and stressed the value of intangibles.</p>
        <p>''It's flattering to have your name mentioned,'' said Jeter, who is second in the league with a .335 average, and has 17 homers, 73 runs batted in, a league-high 111 runs scored and 25 stolen bases. ''I'm not going to hit 50 homers or have 180 r.b.i.'s. Not too many people can do that. But you can work on the little things and the things that are valuable to your team. For me, it's moving a guy over, bunting and playing defense. A lot of people look at homers and r.b.i.'s as the only thing that's important, and that's not true.''</p>
        <p>Then Jeter mentioned how shortstop Barry Larkin won the award with Cincinnati in 1995 while hitting .319 with 15 homers, 66 r.b.i. and 51 steals.</p>
        <p>''M.v.p. is the most valuable player,'' Jeter said, ''not necessarily the player who had the best numbers or had the best year.''</p>
        <p>When Joe Torre was asked about the m.v.p., the first name that spilled out of his mouth was Jeter, then Williams, who leads the A.L. with a .341 average.</p>
        <p>''What makes it tough with our ball club is we've had so many players contribute, there will be a splitting of the votes,'' Torre said. ''All of a sudden, the guy with the best numbers gets it.''</p>
        <p>Although that might be Gonzalez (.306, 39 homers, a major league-best 144 r.b.i.), Garciaparra has incredible statistics for a shortstop (.325, 30 homers, 110 r.b.i.) and is probably the front-runner to win. Or will Vaughn, the soul of the Red Sox and a .331 hitter with 34 homers, snag more votes? What about Williams, a center fielder and integral switch-hitter with 21 homers and 83 r.b.i.?</p>
        <p>Ask Jeter what he needs to improve on and he responds like a high school senior addressing a college coach. He wants to run the bases better, reduce his strikeouts, boost his on-base percentage, cut down on his errors and belt 30 homers. Most important, the m.v.p. candidate wants to continue hearing squeals until the Yankees win another ring.</p>
        <p>''The only way we can have a better season than when we won the World Series in 1996 is to do it again,'' Jeter said. ''Regardless of what we do in the regular season, unless we win the World Series again, it's not going to be very rewarding.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees will pursue their 100th victory behind ORLANDO HERNANDEZ when they play the White Sox in Chicago tonight. If the Yankees win it in their 138th game, it would be the fifth-fewest games needed to reach that plateau.</p>
        <p>DAVID CONE should have four or five more starts left, and he is 19 innings short of hitting 200 innings and controlling a $5.5 million option for next year. ''I'm not worried about winning 20 or pitching 200 innings,'' said Cone, who is 18-5. ''I think I've pitched well. The most important thing is resting for the playoffs.''</p>
