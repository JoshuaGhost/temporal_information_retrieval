        <p>Parade Ground, sixth in the Kentucky Derby and fourth in the Belmont, continued to flourish since being switched to the grass, winning yesterday's $125,000 Lawrence Realization at Belmont for his third victory in four starts on the turf.</p>
        <p>Confidently ridden by Pat Day, Parade Ground rallied along the inside on the far turn and then held off a late flurry from the 31-1 shot Pay Zone to win by a half-length in a stakes record 2:254</p>

        <p>Parade Ground returned $3.40 for $2 to win as he earned $83,595 for the owner William S. Farish.</p>
        <p>The trainer Neil Howard said he had not yet made plans for the colt's next start, but did not rule out the $2 million Breeders' Cup Turf on Nov. 7 at Churchill Downs.</p>
