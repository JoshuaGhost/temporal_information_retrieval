        <p>Carol Kay, a professor of 18th-century literature and culture at the University of Pittsburgh, died on Sept. 12 at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 51.</p>
        <p>The cause was aplastic anemia, said her husband, Jonathan Arac.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kay wrote ''Political Constructions'' (Cornell University Press, 1988), which examined the political history, moral philosophy and fiction between the English civil war and the French Revolution. Claudia L. Johnson, a professor of English at Princeton University, called the book ''one of this generation's most important studies of 18th-century fiction.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kay graduated from Radcliffe College in 1967 and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1975. From 1973 to 1979 she taught English at Princeton. She held faculty appointments at Amherst College, at Washington University in St. Louis and at New York University. In 1989 she became an associate professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kay is survived by her husband, Mr. Arac, and by her brother, Jeffrey Kay of Takoma Park, Md.</p>
