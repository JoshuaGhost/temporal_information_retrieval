        <p>For a few minutes on Wednesday night, I thought Jim Henson had come back to life. There were puppets onstage at the Public Theater with the irresistible combination of heart-tugging cuteness and everybody-dies edge. But the story's setting was some Weimar-like republic, newly ruled by a group called the Common Good, and the humor was an intertwining of the political and the sexual that evoked the dark essence of ''Cabaret.'' There were a lot of four-letter words. No Muppets need apply.</p>
        <p>The Ronnie Burkett Theater of Marionettes' one-man, 37-marionette show, ''Tinka's New Dress,'' which is part of the International Festival of Puppet Theater (produced by the Jim Henson Foundation), is brilliant.</p>

        <p>For a few minutes on Wednesday night, I thought Jim Henson had come back to life. There were puppets onstage at the Public Theater with the irresistible combination of heart-tugging cuteness and everybody-dies edge. But the story's setting was some Weimar-like republic, newly ruled by a group called the Common Good, and the humor was an intertwining of the political and the sexual that evoked the dark essence of ''Cabaret.'' There were a lot of four-letter words. No Muppets need apply.</p>
        <p>The Ronnie Burkett Theater of Marionettes' one-man, 37-marionette show, ''Tinka's New Dress,'' which is part of the International Festival of Puppet Theater (produced by the Jim Henson Foundation), is brilliant.</p>
        <p>The set, an exquisite dark-brass carousel with marionettes seated on the animals, has a deceptive sweetness. The ominous preshow announcements, from the fictional Common Good, are more accurate harbingers of the show's mood. ''Compliance is the core of civilization,'' a woman's voice intones. ''Please have your identification card available for inspection at all times.'' ''This area is now secured. Movement will be monitored.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burkett, whose theater company is based in Calgary, Alberta, appears and brings out the marionettes he will operate and speak for over the next 2 hours 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>There is an old man, Stefan, distressed because his puppet theater in the park, ''The Franz and Schnitzel Show,'' may be closed down by the authorities. His protege, Karl -- ''an unknown with ideals,'' as one character calls him -- is the evening's protagonist. Karl is gay and political; he opposes the new dictatorship (which considers his sexual orientation a disease), and he is doing a midnight puppet show at a cabaret. Which is how we come to see the characters Franz and Schnitzel in action. Karl's best friends are his gentle-voiced sister, Tinka, a seamstress with the skills of a couturier, and Morag, a witchy heterosexual drag queen with a heart of gold. All the good characters end up living in a sector of the city they call ''the camps.'' Some come to tragic ends. The very Aryan villains -- like Phipsie, the ''state artist,'' and Ezell, who tells Tinka that she cleans up ''rather nicely for a camp person'' -- live and prosper.</p>
        <p>The two performances of Franz (a tall Bozo-style redhead with sex on his mind) and Schnitzel (sort of a deformed white mouse with a high, sweet voice like Lamb Chop's) are priceless. ''I refuse to use my innate cuteness for such puppet games anymore!,'' Schnitzel declares when he's politicized. Mr. Burkett works in Clinton jokes, Canada jokes and jokes that ridicule uptown theater audiences and ticket prices. A special puppet guest, Madame Rodrigue, teaches the audience how to greet a diva properly.</p>
        <p>The portrayals of Karl and the other marionette characters' real, offstage lives are touching but not quite as inspired as the comic relief. In the end, though, the show wouldn't work without the juxtaposition of laughter and despair.</p>
        <p>If you can't get into ''Cabaret'' this weekend, see ''Tinka's New Dress,'' which continues through Sunday. It doesn't have Alan Cumming, but if you hummed a few bars, Schnitzel could probably do a mean version of ''Wilkommen.''</p>
