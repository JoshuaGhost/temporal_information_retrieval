        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Lewis (column, Sept. 8) asserts that the President is entitled to what Justice Louis Brandeis called ''the right to be let alone.'' Among President Clinton's many hypocrisies are these: he demands privacy rights for himself, and yet he signed the Defense of Marriage Act, and his ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy has resulted in record discharges of lesbian and gay members of the armed forces.</p>
