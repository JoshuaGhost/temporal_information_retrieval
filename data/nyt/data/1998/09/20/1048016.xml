        <p>TO: Kenneth W. Starr  FROM: Volumnia Valence, Editor-in-Chief  RE: Manuscript Submission</p>
        <p>Thank you for the manuscript of ''Referral,'' your story of romantic intrigue. We had been looking forward to it, given all the buzz comparing you to Harold Robbins, Jackie Susann and the other great masters of what those media philistines keep calling the ''trashy novel.'' We eagerly began reading the original draft, plus each shipment of pages you keep sending (please stop!).</p>
        <p>But I'm afraid it's not for us. ''Referral,'' while an ambitious first effort, simply does not meet the standards we like to maintain here at Soaring Stallion Press.</p>

        <p>TO: Kenneth W. Starr  FROM: Volumnia Valence, Editor-in-Chief  RE: Manuscript Submission</p>
        <p>Thank you for the manuscript of ''Referral,'' your story of romantic intrigue. We had been looking forward to it, given all the buzz comparing you to Harold Robbins, Jackie Susann and the other great masters of what those media philistines keep calling the ''trashy novel.'' We eagerly began reading the original draft, plus each shipment of pages you keep sending (please stop!).</p>
        <p>But I'm afraid it's not for us. ''Referral,'' while an ambitious first effort, simply does not meet the standards we like to maintain here at Soaring Stallion Press.</p>
        <p>First, it needs editing. It is simply not sexy to describe the same sex act three times, and then follow with five footnotes about said act. We get the idea the first time.</p>
        <p>Actually our senior editor, Jane V. V. Voom, who specializes in serial-killer romance mysteries, found your constant reiteration of the same facts ''disturbing and possibly pathological.''</p>
        <p>Don't worry, that's just typical Jane! But your repetitions do destroy the natural rhythms of lust. Sex builds. It arcs. It climaxes. It is supposed to be fun. You make it sound a bit like homework.</p>
        <p>And so unpleasantly tawdry! During an initial courtship scene, your Monica character flashes her lingerie: ''In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants.''</p>
        <p>Now, we have absolutely nothing against thong underwear. In our recent best-seller, ''The Golddiggers of Grenada,'' Letitia Lawrence wears a thong dotted with miniature tropical drinks. Of course, a good heroine should wear a thong -- but not until much later!</p>
        <p>We would prefer a ''meet cute'' scenario. If she must work in his office, perhaps one could knock over a filing cabinet onto the other? Something sudden and less obvious. Have you read our top-selling title, ''The Empty Duplex''? In this wonderful novel, Federica and Bartholomew meet when they discover they  have the same real estate agent. We aren't introduced to Federica's thong until page 300. And Bartholomew finds it even later.</p>
        <p>Believe us, if you begin with a thong, you have nowhere to go.</p>
        <p>And that's the point, Ken: We want somewhere to go. We crave emotional depths from your characters. We want to believe that Bill, like Bartholomew, would give up a whole semiconductor empire for the right girl. Wars come and go, the real estate market crashes, landlords renege, but passion always triumphs.</p>
        <p>Think about that when you rewrite moments like this one: ''[They] briefly discussed an antique book that she had dropped off. . . . With the book, she enclosed a letter telling the President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him at least once.''</p>
        <p>Ken, that's cold! Remember, always show, don't tell. Give us an inkling of inner life. And for God's sake don't make the woman plead for sex in a letter; it's undignified. If your characters are going to resist complete consummation -- a choice I should tell you does lower your chances of getting published -- at least they should feel a few pangs of desire.</p>
        <p>How about this instead:</p>
        <p>The leather bindings cracked beneath his fingers. A first edition, never read, flown in from a Beverly Hills dealer. He was no fool. He knew how much such a book would cost. And his office hadn't even paid her a salary. Thank God she came from money. She would never need to sell the rights to their story. She would always buy him thoughtful gifts that neither of them would have the time to read or fully absorb. He leafed through the yellowing pages. There was a letter inside, sealed with wax. He looked up. ''I don't care what this letter says, Monica,'' he told her. ''I must have you.''</p>
        <p>''Now?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' he said firmly. ''And if not now, eventually.''</p>
        <p>We want a hero who doesn't need to read directions or take polls. We want a heroine who follows her gut. But you give us a hero who worries about what the world will think and a heroine who worries about what the hero will think. (Meanwhile, given the close proximity of Betty the secretary, the reader is distracted with thoughts of what she must think.)</p>
        <p>We want passionate thoughts, cloaked in passionate language. Although we have been editing risque works of fiction for years, your lurid yet clinical style upset everyone here enormously. You tally and clock events as if each encounter were not unique and timeless. You state there are ''nine incidents'' involving ''breasts.'' Why not just say: ''She held him to her cleavage again.  And again . . .''?</p>
        <p>I wonder too: Can't she hold him to her cleavage in a more rapturous setting? Why set every scene in that irritating office with all those interruptions? He is powerful. She is rich. You would think they could get a hotel room. A dusky beach at sunset. Or at least a bed of some kind. Lovers ought to be wrapped in silken sheets, or in resilient animal rugs or hearth coverings. The intern character stays on the floor too much, while the President sits in his chair for long periods, which makes the reader worry about his bad back.</p>
        <p>Finally, your characters are strange. Your hero does not seem to know what sexual relations are. Your heroine does not seem to accept that he is the leader of the free world. Instead of jewels and vows, they exchange a hat pin, a letter opener embellished with a frog, an Annie Lennox recording and, ultimately, a series of tacky souvenirs.</p>
        <p>In short, they seem completely incapable of having a romantic affair as we at Soaring Stallion Press define romantic affair. And we have been in the business of defining it for a long time.</p>
        <p>I should warn you that yours is not the kind of fare that would normally be found in a mainstream bookstore. You may want to try a softcore porn publisher.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps writing is not your vocation after all. Have you considered law school?</p>
