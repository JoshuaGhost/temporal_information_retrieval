        <p>Beginning next month, students will be able to earn a law degree entirely on line.</p>
        <p>Kaplan Educational Centers, a Washington Post Company subsidiary best known for its test-coaching services, is opening the Concord University School of Law, in which students will take all of their courses over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The school will not be accredited by the American Bar Association, however, and as a result graduates will face some limits to where they can practice law. California is one state that will welcome them.</p>
        <p>The school, which began accepting applications last week (www.concord.kaplan.edu), expects to attract people whose careers, family obligations or geographic locations make it hard for them to attend traditional law schools.</p>
        <p>The cost, $4,200 a year for a four-year law degree program, will be far below the cost at most private universities and even less than at many public ones.</p>
