        <p>Editorial, commenting on threat of global recession from collapse of Asian economies and plunging commodity prices, says aid from International Monetary Fund is needed more than ever in current situation; urges immediate Congressional approval of $18 billion needed by agency, with leaders making clear that they are open to further actions that may be needed to avert world recession (M)</p>

        <p>A quarter of a century ago when Washington was mired in scandal, the greatest challenge to global prosperity since the Great Depression presented itself in the form of an Arab oil embargo that promptly led to spiraling inflation, recession in the Western world and, within a few years, a third-world debt crisis that stifled development in Latin America for a generation. The largest economies were unable to respond to those challenges in a timely manner, and the world suffered.</p>
        <p>Now, with Washington immersed in another scandal, another major threat to world prosperity has arisen from the collapse in Asia and plunging commodity prices that endanger much of the past decade's progress in developing countries. There is reason to hope the response this time will be better. The Group of Seven countries say they will cooperate in stimulating world growth. Those actions should include a coordinated lowering of interest rates by central banks in Europe and America.</p>

        <p>A quarter of a century ago when Washington was mired in scandal, the greatest challenge to global prosperity since the Great Depression presented itself in the form of an Arab oil embargo that promptly led to spiraling inflation, recession in the Western world and, within a few years, a third-world debt crisis that stifled development in Latin America for a generation. The largest economies were unable to respond to those challenges in a timely manner, and the world suffered.</p>
        <p>Now, with Washington immersed in another scandal, another major threat to world prosperity has arisen from the collapse in Asia and plunging commodity prices that endanger much of the past decade's progress in developing countries. There is reason to hope the response this time will be better. The Group of Seven countries say they will cooperate in stimulating world growth. Those actions should include a coordinated lowering of interest rates by central banks in Europe and America.</p>
        <p>The current crisis has brought on a widespread shift in investor psychology. Those who invested in developing countries with too little regard for risk now can see only risk as they flee. That capital flight has forced developing countries to raise interest rates to protect their currencies, thus putting a further drag on economies already in recession. Many such countries depend on the export of commodities, whose prices have plunged as world growth has slowed. Many companies, particularly in Asia, are unable to meet their dollar-denominated debt obligations because their home currencies have collapsed.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, in an important economic address in New York this week, was right to say the world must look for ways to ameliorate those problems by spurring growth in the industrial world, particularly in Japan, whose own recession could not be occurring at a worse time. He was also right that ways need to be found to relieve some of the debts facing Asian countries.</p>
        <p>None of that will be easy. In retrospect, the International Monetary Fund probably pushed for policies that were too restrictive when the Asian crisis erupted a year ago. But its aid is needed more than ever in the current situation, as countries deal with panicky investors.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of the sad state of the Clinton Presidency that the President's effort to address the world's economic problems was viewed by many through a Monica prism, with commentators wondering whether Mr. Clinton was trying to change the subject. The real question here is whether the American Government can deal effectively with major problems at the same time Congress considers the Starr report. Congress should immediately provide the $18 billion needed by the I.M.F., and its leaders should make clear that they are open to further actions that may be needed to avert a world recession.</p>
