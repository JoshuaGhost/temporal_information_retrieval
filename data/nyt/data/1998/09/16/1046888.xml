        <p>Suffolk County officials sued today to overturn the Long Island Power Authority's two-tiered billing rates and rebates, which they say favor electricity customers in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>Officials of the power authority said they would oppose the suit. They defended the special rates as a way of collecting a refund owed to customers by local governments in Suffolk that had levied excess property taxes on the abandoned nuclear power plant at Shoreham.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Legislature filed its suit in State Supreme Court in Riverhead. At a news conference here, the Legislature's presiding officer, C. Stephen Hackeling, said, ''No matter how you shake it, no matter how you bake it, this is unfair for Suffolk County.''</p>
        <p>But the power authority's chairman, Richard M. Kessel, replied in a telephone interview, ''It's unfortunate that the politicians of Suffolk County would seek to take money that is owed to the ratepayers of Long Island, including their own constituents.''</p>
        <p>At issue is who, if anyone, should pay for a 1996 court decision that said customers of the old Long Island Lighting Company had been overcharged for taxes on the utility's Shoreham plant. That decision ordered a refund that, with interest, now totals about $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>When the court issued the order, Suffolk officials said they feared that repaying the refund would prompt huge tax increases or even bankrupt the local governments that had benefited from the overcharges -- the county, Brookhaven Town and the Shoreham-Wading River School District. The officials contested the court order but recently lost their appeal.</p>
        <p>Worries over the Shoreham refund became a catalyst that helped Gov. George E. Pataki forge his broader plan for the power authority, a state agency, to buy Lilco's electricity delivery system and use tax-free municipal bonds to help reduce billing rates. The takeover was completed on May 28.</p>
        <p>To resolve the Shoreham case, the Pataki plan proposed cutting the refund to $625 million and financing it with authority bonds. In anticipation of repaying those bonds, the authority is already giving electricity customers in Suffolk a smaller rebate, $101 each, compared with $232 per customer in Nassau. And for the next 30 years the authority is also imposing a higher electricity rate in Suffolk, where customers got a 19.1 percent cut from the old Lilco rates, compared with a 20.9 percent cut in Nassau.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, has agreed to the Pataki plan, but the Suffolk Legislature has not approved it. Mr. Kessel said that if the Legislature continues to balk, his agency would be forced to collect the full $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>In today's suit, Suffolk officials contended that the power authority has no legal right to collect anything for Shoreham. They cited a section of the state law that created the authority that they say requires the agency to drop any Lilco claims for refunds on the Shoreham plant.</p>
        <p>''We don't owe anything,'' Mr. Hackeling said. He cited testimony to the County Legislature in 1995 by Mr. Kessel and by the authority's counsel, Richard Bonafield, saying that if the authority took over Lilco, the Shoreham tax case would be dropped.</p>
        <p>But the power authority says that the Suffolk officials have misinterpreted the law. Mr. Kessel said his earlier comments on dropping the Shoreham case were when it was still just a claim, but the situation changed when Lilco won its 1996 court order. The power authority would be remiss not to seek the money it is entitled to, he said.</p>
        <p>The same legal issues are being raised in a parallel suit filed by opponents of the Lilco takeover deal and now pending before Justice Melvyn Tanenbaum of State Supreme Court. The lawyer in that case, Irving Like, said that the two suits might be joined.</p>
        <p>Although some critics have said that the Pataki plan favors Suffolk by solving the Shoreham tax problem, Mr. Hackeling argued that the plan gives Nassau unfair advantage and that Suffolk deserves money back. Nassau has systematically overassessed its Lilco property, Mr. Hackeling said, and the Pataki plan drops Lilco tax refund cases on other power plants involving $351 million of tax refunds in Nassau and $124 million in Suffolk.</p>
        <p>The dispute over the Shoreham tax refund is politically delicate in Suffolk. Brookhaven, whose assessors set the rates for the Shoreham plant, is the county's biggest and most powerful town. It is home to both Mr. Gaffney and the Republican county chairman, John Powell. Residents of Suffolk's other nine towns are not eager to pay higher electric rates for Brookhaven's assessing mistakes and the excess taxes it and the school district enjoyed.</p>
        <p>In opposing any refund for Shoreham, however, the entire Legislature is united. ''On this issue,'' Mr. Hackeling said, ''we are all four-square together.''</p>
