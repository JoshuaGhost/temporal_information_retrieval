        <p>BETSY KING CLASSIC  Richard and Daniel Share the Lead</p>
        <p>Deb Richard and Beth Daniel shot five-under-par 67's yesterday in Kutztown, Pa., to share the opening-round lead in the LPGA First Union Betsy King Classic at Berkleigh Country Club.</p>
        <p>Richard and Daniel each had six birdies and one bogey, including two-under 33's on the front nine.</p>
        <p>Thirty-nine players in the field of 140 golfers broke par.</p>
        <p>TEXAS OPEN  Weibring Holds One-Stroke Lead</p>
        <p>D.A. Weibring wasn't sure earlier this week whether he would be playing in the Texas Open or traveling to Illinois to tend to his sick mother.</p>
        <p>With his family's support, he opted to play golf. He wasn't disappointed. Weibring shot a seven-under-par 65 yesterday in San Antonio to take a one-stroke lead in the first round of the Texas Open.</p>
        <p>Weibring felt confident his mother, recuperating well after colon surgery, would cheer his first-round performance. He reeled off seven birdies and enjoyed a bogey-free day for his best start since shooting a 64 in the Quad City Classic in July.</p>
        <p>Jim McGovern shot a six-under 66, overcoming two bogeys with the help of six birdies plus a 10-foot putt for eagle on the par-5 14th hole. (AP)</p>
        <p>GERMAN MASTERS  Montgomerie, Singh Are Tied With 65's</p>
        <p>Colin Montgomerie, seeking to become Europe's leading money winner for a sixth straight year, shot a seven-under-par 65 yesterday to share the first- round lead at the German Masters at Cologne.</p>
        <p>The Scotsman had seven birdies and no bogeys on a sunny windless day.(AP)</p>
