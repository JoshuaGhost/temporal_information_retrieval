        <p>Aid is Slow for Flooded Chiapas  The worst floods in Mexico in this century washed away or interred thousands of homes along the coastline of Chiapas state. Ten days after the floods began their destruction, many coastal communities remained cut off from overland aid deliveries, and the Government's helicopter airlift has been slowed by rain and a lack of supplies.  A3</p>
        <p>An Opposition Party for China  Dissidents in China have applied to register local branches of an opposition organization, the China Democratic Party, rights groups said.

        <p>Typhoon Hits Northern Japan  Typhoon Stella struck central and northern Japan with 65 m.p.h. winds, triggering floods and landslides, stalling 1,600 trains and killing at least four people. Another 25 people were injured as the typhoon, Japan's fifth of the season, cut its way through northern Japan to the Pacific Ocean. In 24 hours, the storm dumped up to 14 inches of rain on areas still recovering from severe flooding caused by a Typhoon Rex last month. Sixteen deaths were attributed to that storm. (AP)</p>
