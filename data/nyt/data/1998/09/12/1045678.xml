        <p>A Federal judge yesterday warned two police officers accused of brutalizing Abner Louima at a Brooklyn station house in 1997 that there was a risk they might not get the best possible defense if they kept their lawyers because of ''actual or potential conflicts of interest'' that the lawyers have in the case.</p>
        <p>But the judge, Eugene H. Nickerson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, said he would permit the officers to keep the lawyers if the officers convinced him at a hearing next week that they fully understood the risk and were willing to accept it.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A Federal judge yesterday warned two police officers accused of brutalizing Abner Louima at a Brooklyn station house in 1997 that there was a risk they might not get the best possible defense if they kept their lawyers because of ''actual or potential conflicts of interest'' that the lawyers have in the case.</p>
        <p>But the judge, Eugene H. Nickerson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, said he would permit the officers to keep the lawyers if the officers convinced him at a hearing next week that they fully understood the risk and were willing to accept it.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the lawyers, when retained to represent the officers in August 1997 -- shortly after Mr. Louima says he was assaulted and tortured by a group of officers who arrested him in a Brooklyn street brawl -- were with separate law firms but have since become partners in a new firm.</p>
        <p>Further adding to the actual or potential conflicts, the judge said, was that the new firm obtained a $10 million, two-year contract with the city police officers' union under which the firm, since May 1, has been representing all of the union's members in court cases stemming from their actions while on duty.</p>
        <p>''Don't take this lightly -- this is a serious matter,'' Judge Nickerson told the two officers, Charles Schwarz and Thomas Bruder, as they stood before him while he explained to each of them that ''the fact that your attorney has a law partner representing another defendant'' in the same case ''may cause him to hesitate to exercise his independent judgment on your behalf.''</p>
        <p>The judge was echoing the view of the prosecutors in the case, from the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn, who first raised the conflict issue in May, saying that the risks posed by a single law firm representing co-defendants in a criminal case included ''the possibility that one partner will forgo viable defense strategies beneficial to his client but which may conflict with the strategy of his partner.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutors are wary of any situation that might let officers in the case -- in which four officers are charged with violating Mr. Louima's civil rights -- appeal a conviction using the argument that their lawyers' conflicts kept them from receiving the most effective defense.</p>
        <p>Judge Nickerson directly discussed this possibility yesterday, telling Officers Schwarz and Bruder that if they chose to keep their lawyers -- Stephen C. Worth for Officer Schwarz and Stuart London for Officer Bruder -- ''you should understand you have no ground to complain about it if there's a conviction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Worth and Mr. London have repeatedly held that there are no conflicts that require their removal from the case, whether the issue involves their representation of two officers charged in the Federal criminal case or their representation of police officers generally through their contract with the union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>Officers Bruder and Schwarz are among five members of the force  being prosecuted in the case, with the three others -- Officers Justin A. Volpe and Thomas Wiese and Sgt. Michael Bellomo -- represented by lawyers who are not partners with Mr. London and Mr. Worth or with one another.</p>
        <p>All except Sergeant Bellomo are charged with violating Mr. Louima's rights. Prosecutors say that the four officers beat Mr. Louima in a police car on the way to the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush after he was arrested in the brawl.</p>
        <p>Officer Volpe is also accused of later ramming a stick into Mr. Louima's rectum and then his mouth in a station house bathroom, causing major internal injuries, while Officer Schwarz allegedly held Mr. Louima down.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Bellomo is charged with trying to cover up the beating. The five officers say the charges are untrue.</p>
