        <p>Coverage of the independent counsel's report to Congress on President Clinton forced CBS yesterday to pre-empt the first two sets of Martina Hingis's semifinal victory over Jana Novotna at the United States Open.</p>
        <p>CBS News broke into the men's doubles final several times for special reports on Kenneth W. Starr's findings and later cut into the Hingis-Novotna match from 1:45 to 3:10 P.M. before returning after the first game of the third set. CBS never asked the USA Network, which has been carrying the tournament on cable television, to take over the match because of uncertainty about the length of the pre-emptions.</p>

        <p>''There were no rules about when they'd get on and off,'' said Gordon Beck, senior vice president of the USA Network. ''They were playing it by ear. They needed to make a definitive decision to pre-empt for us to take it.''</p>
        <p>LeslieAnne Wade, a CBS Sports spokeswoman, said, ''CBS has a responsibility to carry breaking national news.'' The network did carry the second women's semifinal, between Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams, with minor interruptions for news reports.</p>
