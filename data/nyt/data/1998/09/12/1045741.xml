        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, Sept. 7) criticizes Democrats in the New York Assembly for being ''perplexingly quiet'' during the controversy over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's policy to end remediation at the City University of New York's senior colleges.</p>
        <p>I am appointed by Speaker Sheldon Silver to deal with CUNY and have held nearly 200 meetings and 2 public hearings on the matter. I have testified at two other hearings held by the New York City Council. I have  quizzed CUNY officials at the Legislature's financial hearings and have given dozens of interviews.</p>
        <p>I wrote the news release presented by the Speaker when several dozen Assembly Democrats joined in denouncing the Mayor's policy. In these efforts, members of the black and Hispanic caucus have been fully supportive and frequently participants.</p>
        <p>EDWARD C. SULLIVAN  Albany, Sept. 9, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is chairman, Assembly Committee on Higher Education.</p>
