        <p>Mirjana Lucic, who said last week that she had left her father/coach, Marinko, because he physically abused her and tampered with her prize money, did not let her family problems interfere with her United States Open assignment.</p>
        <p>Last night, Lucic, a 16-year-old from Croatia, sped through the first round by dismantling Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands, 6-3, 6-2.</p>
        <p>Lucic then confirmed that she, her mother and four siblings intend to remain in the United States indefinitely while she trains at the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton, Fla.</p>
        <p>''This was last year my new beginning, my first Grand Slam, and hopefully this year will be the same; for the first time in my life I'm really enjoying tennis,'' said Lucic, who gained entry into the main draw last year because of a stunning rookie season in which she became the youngest player to win a tour title since Jennifer Capriati in 1990.</p>
        <p>At 15 in Bol, Croatia, Lucic won her first pro event. This year, the 53d-ranked Lucic endured chickenpox that prevented her from defending her Bol title and caused her to miss the French Open; the illness was complicated by family stress that escalated at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>According to Lucic, a disagreement with her father at Wimbledon turned violent, and she and her mother, Angelka, decided a break from him was the only way to salvage her career and future.</p>
        <p>Marinko Lucic, who has denied using ''excessive physical force'' to discipline his daughter or wrongfully taking money, was left behind in Zagreb in July when the rest of the family came to the United States.</p>
        <p>''There was a time when mentally and physically I just couldn't handle it anymore and I had to quit,'' said Lucic, who added that abuse of many other young players is ''still going on.''</p>
        <p>Lucic has received support from Iva Majoli, who was her Fed Cup teammate, and Martina Hingis, who has been a friend and training partner. Hingis, who was host to Lucic and her father last year in her home in Switzerland, endorsed Lucic's decision to move. ''It's a very good solution; under that pressure, nobody really can understand what happened there,'' Hingis said. ''They made a very good move.''</p>
