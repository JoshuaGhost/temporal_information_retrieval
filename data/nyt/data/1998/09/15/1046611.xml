        <p>Unhappy Marriage of Plants</p>
        <p>GENETIC engineering may be enough to push a plant to promiscuity. And that's bad news for the scientists who have been counting on crop plants' propensity to keep themselves to themselves when it comes to reproduction.</p>
        <p>When genetic engineers slip a gene for herbicide resistance into a crop, they hope that the domesticated plants won't pass it around. If the wild plants can't get the gene for resistance, they can be wiped out with the herbicide.</p>
        <p>No one wants to see a generation of untamed interlopers with a gene that lets them thumb their metaphorical noses at the weedkiller.</p>
        <p>That wasn't thought to be much of a danger because most crop plants are self-fertilizing. But when Dr. Joy Bergelson of the University of Chicago and two colleagues looked at genetically engineered Arabidopsis -- a self-fertilizing mustard plant -- they saw inhibitions against mating with wild relatives melting away.</p>
        <p>And it seems to be gene splicing,  not just the herbicide resistance, that is the cause, the researchers reported in the Sept. 3 issue of the journal Nature. Nonengineered plants with a mutant gene for herbicide resistance showed nowhere near the level of erosion of family values.</p>
        <p>Root of a Waste Problem</p>
        <p>Plant behavior is also causing trouble for scientists working on ways to store nuclear waste.</p>
        <p>When a small amount of radioactive material from the Three Mile Island accident was buried in an experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, scientists expected to see some radioactivity leaching out -- but down, not up. When radioactivity turned up on the surface, they had to figure out why.</p>
        <p>Researchers led by Dr. William Sanford of Colorado State University  reported in the Journal of Environmental Radioactivity that plant roots probably drank in radioactive molecules in water and ferried them to the surface.</p>
        <p>Not All Clocks Are in Synch</p>
        <p>Whether plant or animal, slowpoke or speedster, organisms across a wide swath of biology may use the same basic mechanism for timing daily cycles. But that doesn't mean that all biological clocks evolved from the same ancestral clock, and a study in the Sept. 4 issue of the journal Science indicates that they probably didn't.</p>
        <p>The circadian clock, that self-winding marvel, appears to tick away with swings of a molecular pendulum. The level of a molecule builds until a braking mechanism is triggered; the level falls as the pendulum swings back.</p>
        <p>But researchers from Nagoya University report that the circadian molecules used by blue-green algae are different from those used by mammals and fruit flies, indicating a separate evolutionary origin.</p>
        <p>The clocks all do a remarkable job for their disparate masters. As Alexander Pope said, '' 'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none go just alike, yet each believes his own.''</p>
        <p>Even Birds Need Practice</p>
        <p>Timing is just one of the problems of a young zebra finch trying to learn to sound like one. A study in the Sept. 3 issue of Nature says the syrinx, the source of bird song, is a more complicated instrument than it appears.</p>
        <p>Researchers at Bell Laboratories and the California Institute of Technology looked at the acoustic properties of the isolated syrinx and found the organ is capable of producing a  variety of sounds all on its own, free of muscle control and neural input.</p>
        <p>So a young finch yearning to sound like an adult one day has a tough instrument to master -- more like taking up the French horn than fooling around with a harmonica.</p>
