        <p>The Dreyfus Corporation unit of the Mellon Bank Corporation said yesterday that it had named Grace &amp; Rothschild in New York to handle its account, with billings estimated at $12 million to $15 million. The account had been handled for three years by Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco, which parted ways with Dreyfus in April.</p>
        <p>Richard Roth, president at Richard Roth Associates in Chappaqua, N.Y., who helped manage a three-month review to select a new agency, said that the competition had been narrowed to Grace &amp; Rothschild and two other finalists in New York: Angotti, Thomas, Hedge, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Partners &amp; Shevack, part of Wolf Group. Grace &amp; Rothschild was a dark horse in the review because it  had replaced a finalist -- Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York, also owned by Interpublic -- that withdrew because of a conflict.</p>
