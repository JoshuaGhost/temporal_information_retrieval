        <p>A Federal judge in New York yesterday issued a ruling that pushed back a scheduled teamsters election by almost two months, ordering that the ballots be mailed out on Nov. 2 and returned by Dec. 3.</p>
        <p>The judge, David N. Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan,  ordered the new schedule after a deadlock over how to pay for the election delayed the mailing of the ballots, which had been scheduled for this month.</p>
        <p>Judge Edelstein supervises the International Brotherhood of Teamsters under a 1989 consent decree that provides for Federal supervision of the union. The funding deadlock developed after Congress and the union both refused to provide any of the estimated $8 million needed to finance the election for the teamsters presidency.</p>
        <p>Under the schedule set by Judge Edelstein, notice of the election will be posted on Oct. 2. To prevent union newspapers from improperly influencing the elections, Judge Edelstein temporarily suspended teamster publications beginning on Oct. 12.</p>
