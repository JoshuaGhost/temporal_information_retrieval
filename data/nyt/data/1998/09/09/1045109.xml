        <p>JACKSONVILLE</p>
        <p>The Jaguars defensive end Jeff Lageman, a 10-year veteran, will undergo surgery to repair a torn right biceps muscle and might miss the rest of the season, the team said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The loss of Lageman, who was hurt while tackling the Bears running back Edgar Bennett in the first quarter of Jacksonville's 24-23 victory on Sunday, leaves the Jaguars without two of their top defensive players for this weekend's game against the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
        <p>Defensive end Tony Brackens, who missed the game with an ankle sprain, may be out another couple of weeks for the Bears.</p>
        <p>Lageman, 31, was re-signed by the Jaguars after last season, during which he had 56 tackles and five sacks while also forcing three fumbles. (Bloomberg News)</p>

        <p>A week after ending a holdout in return for a $3 million tender offer, defensive end Joe Johnson signed a five-year, $22 million contract with the Saints.</p>
        <p>Johnson, designated as the Saints' franchise player, was a no-show throughout training camp and at one point said he no longer wanted to play for the team. He reported last week, accepting the tender offer with the understanding that negotiations would continue. On Sunday, during the Saints' 24-17 season-opening victory against the St. Louis Rams, he scored his first National Football League touchdown after scooping up a fumble.</p>
        <p>The contract includes incentives that could increase the value to as high as $26 million, and could allow Johnson to void the fifth year, said the Saints' salary-cap consultant, Terry O'Neil, who negotiated the contract.</p>
        <p>Johnson made a career-high eight and a half sacks. (AP)</p>
