        <p>Giving a brilliant performance in his New York debut, Shane Mosley kept pounding Eduardo Morales of Argentina until Morales sagged into the corner and had to be saved by the referee in the fifth round last night at the Theater in Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>The referee Arthur Mercante Jr. stopped the fight at 2 minutes 6 seconds of the round, and it was not a second too soon for Morales (26-1), who was knocked down twice in the fight and lost for the first time. Mosley (29-0), arguably one of the top five fighters in the world, retained his International Boxing Federation lightweight title before a crowd of 4,062. In the co-feature bout, Angel Manfredy was given a tough fight by John Brown of Atlantic City but still managed to win a unanimous 12-round decision to retain his World Boxing Union super featherweight championship.</p>

        <p>Giving a brilliant performance in his New York debut, Shane Mosley kept pounding Eduardo Morales of Argentina until Morales sagged into the corner and had to be saved by the referee in the fifth round last night at the Theater in Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>The referee Arthur Mercante Jr. stopped the fight at 2 minutes 6 seconds of the round, and it was not a second too soon for Morales (26-1), who was knocked down twice in the fight and lost for the first time. Mosley (29-0), arguably one of the top five fighters in the world, retained his International Boxing Federation lightweight title before a crowd of 4,062. In the co-feature bout, Angel Manfredy was given a tough fight by John Brown of Atlantic City but still managed to win a unanimous 12-round decision to retain his World Boxing Union super featherweight championship.</p>
        <p>Mosley floored Morales in the third round with a left hand that looked like a jab followed by with a left to the body that sat Morales on the bottom rope. Mosley got his second knockdown with a left-right combination early in the fifth round, then sent Morales reeling into the corner with a left to the body.</p>
        <p>Mercante could see that Morales had had enough.</p>
        <p>''I knew the kid was kind of strong,'' Mosley said. ''I knew it was going to take a little time. But I knew I was better than him. He was trying hard. He caught me in the first round and I was like, 'Uh-oh!' He was heavy handed. I thought he was ready to go in the fourth. I knew I could weaken him down.''</p>
        <p>According to CompuBox statistics, Mosley landed 84 of 111 power punches while Morales landed a total of only 21 punches during the bout. ''He hit me in the ribs and that really hurt me,'' Morales said. ''He's the toughest guy I've fought in my career. I fought my best. I did all I possibly could.''</p>
        <p>Manfredy may have taken Brown lightly, and it took everything he could muster to score the unanimous decision. ''He's tough,'' Manfredy said. ''He head-butted too much. The referee didn't do a good job.</p>
        <p>''He kept using his head. He held onto one of my hands all night long. I could only throw one hand. He did get a couple of good shots in, but I took them. I absorbed them. My experience won the fight.''</p>
        <p>Referee Wayne Kelly said both Manfredy and Brown were coming in with their heads down, and that all the butting was accidental. Brown staggered Manfredy late in the eighth with a straight right that caught Manfredy flush on the face. Until that point, Brown's punches seemed to be bouncing off of Manfredy's body as if he were wearing armor.</p>
        <p>In the 10th round, after repeated warnings, Kelly took a point away from Brown for a low blow. Manfredy opened a cut over Brown's left eye in the final round. The judges Steve Weisfeld and Paul Herman scored it, 115-112, and Melvina Latham scored it, 116-111, all for Manfredy.</p>
        <p>''It's politics that they gave it to him,'' Brown said.</p>
        <p>On the undercard, Louis Del Valle of the Bronx (28-2) won an eight-round unanimous decision against Tyrone Armstead of Evansville, Ill. (9-7-2). It was Del Valle's first fight since he lost a World Boxing Association lightweight title against Roy Jones Jr. at the Garden on July 18. Del Valle took this fight on 10 days' notice. Besides the short notice, Del Valle was plagued by the flu leading up to the fight and was injured in a car accident.</p>
        <p>Also on the undercard, Danell Nicholson (31-3) scored a knockout at 2:58 of the first round against James Haynes of Corbin, Ky. (10-9-1). Masibulele (Hawk) Makepula of East London, South Africa (14-0) won the World Boxing Union junior flyweight championship after he hit Rafael Torres of Santiago, Puerto Rico (15-8) with an accidental low blow in the fifth round. Under New York State boxing rules if the fighter is not able to continue after a five-minute rest, which Torres was not, then it goes to the scorecards and Makepula was ahead by 40-36 on all the judges' scorecards.
