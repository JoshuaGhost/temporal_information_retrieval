        <p>Patrick Ewing of the Knicks said yesterday that there was no progress between the owners and players toward ending their labor dispute, which enhanced the possibility of a regular-season work stoppage.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he believed the season would start as scheduled on Nov. 3, Ewing replied: I really don't know. All we can do is hope.</p>
        <p>Ewing, the president of the players association, spoke at the Brae Burn Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., before departing for Charlie Ward's celebrity golf classic, which benefits Big Brothers Big Sisters of Family Service of Westchester.</p>
        <p>The owners delivered a new proposal to the players last Friday, their first since May 27. It came on the heels of the league's canceling the first week of preseason games and indefinitely postponing training camp last Thursday. League officials are now considering canceling the entire preseason.</p>
