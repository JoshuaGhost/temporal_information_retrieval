        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Solomon should have checked his sources before writing the article ''Inanimate Selves, Alternate Realities'' [Sept. 6].</p>
        <p>He quotes the Book of Genesis, writing, ''And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.'' Yet this is not comparable to Mr. Solomon's definition of ''what puppeteers do, using humble materials to model their own images, and then breathing finite life into those figures.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Solomon should have checked his sources before writing the article ''Inanimate Selves, Alternate Realities'' [Sept. 6].</p>
        <p>He quotes the Book of Genesis, writing, ''And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.'' Yet this is not comparable to Mr. Solomon's definition of ''what puppeteers do, using humble materials to model their own images, and then breathing finite life into those figures.''</p>
        <p>While a man's soul lives forever, a puppet, unlike plants and animals, will never be alive, nor will it be made of dust.</p>
        <p>A ''shaman'' -- Mr. Solomon's word -- is a wizard or conjurer who can influence good and evil spirits. To imply that a priest is like a shaman and a puppeteer, ''who, before the eyes of his congregation, transforms the inanimate wafer and wine into the living flesh and blood of Jesus Christ,'' demonstrates ignorance.</p>
        <p>The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' states: ''It is not man that causes the things offered to become the Body and Blood of Christ, but he who was crucified for us, Christ himself. The priest, in the role of Christ, pronounces these words, but their power and grace are God's.''</p>
