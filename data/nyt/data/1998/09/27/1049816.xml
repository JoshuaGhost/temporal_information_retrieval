        <p>JAMES IVORY boasts about the fact that in the many movies he has made about authors, he has almost never shown one writing. ''I never even for one second thought of him writing,'' said Mr. Ivory of his latest character, the novelist James Jones, in the new film ''A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.'' The image of the miserable outsider, an alcoholic tormented by writer's block, facing a forbidding black Remington portable in a seedy hotel room, is a commonplace of films about writers, and Mr. Ivory has always strived to avoid it.</p>
        <p>In fact, there is a long tradition of movies about writers, and they present directors with a number of technical and artistic challenges -- not the least of which is, how do you depict what is essentially an interior, solitary, intellectual process in a visual medium like film?</p>
        <p>The difficulty in portraying a writer's life, Mr. Ivory said, is that ''there is nothing to be seen.'' The typical writer's activities are limited, at best. ''Would his eyes narrow, then he leans forward?'' Mr. Ivory asked. ''Then he is not satisfied and he tears it up?'' Or, ''There's some dramatic thing he witnesses? He flies into action. He tears his hair out.'' Sometimes, for the sake of action, the director shows the writer reading his work out loud to people. ''My experience is writers would rather die than do that,'' Mr. Ivory said.</p>
        <p>Yet directors are obviously drawn to these characters: There are literally dozens of movies about writers, including ''The Life of Emile Zola,''  ''Henry and June,'' ''Tom &amp; Viv,''  ''Barton Fink,'' and ''The Shining.''</p>
        <p>And now there is ''Permanent Midnight,'' with Ben Stiller as a heroin-addicted television writer. Woody Allen's latest comedy, ''Celebrity,'' which opened the New York Film Festival on Friday, centers on a grasping, confused writer played by Kenneth Branagh. Then, ''Shakespeare in Love,'' with a script by Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard, about Shakespeare as a young man with writer's block, is due to be released Dec. 4.</p>
        <p>If anything, the figure of James Jones, played by Kris Kristofferson in ''A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' which was based on Kaylie Jones's novel about her father and opened earlier this month, is atypical of the form. Jones is apparently untroubled by self doubt and creative blocks, and cares as much about his family as his work. Though, like most writers on screen, he definitely drinks.</p>
        <p>The stereotypical writer in movies, said Morris Dickstein, Distinguished Professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University, ''is a person who stays at home a lot and never goes off to the office, and becomes very moody at unexpected times.''</p>
        <p>Maybe the lack of action in most authors' lives is one reason filmmakers seem to choose alcoholic writers as subjects -- and, of course, there has been no shortage of boozing writers to portray. F. Scott Fitzgerald in the 1959 movie ''Beloved Infidel,'' for instance, and Dorothy Parker in ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' are only two among many who stagger across the screen. Drinking makes for ''a much better scene -- whether a cliche or not,'' said Mr. Ivory.</p>
        <p>In most films about writers, the artist, by definition a subversive figure, is somehow punished by failure, both sexual and commercial, for his outsider status -- something of a German Romantic notion. ''Henry and June'' (1990) is based on a love triangle involving the writer Henry Miller, his bisexual wife, June, and another writer, Anais Nin. Miller, living in Paris in dire poverty, watches, sometimes with tears streaming down his face, as June makes love to other men, and women.</p>
        <p>''It does have something to do with the status of intellectuals in our culture,'' said Robert Sklar, professor of cinema studies at New York University and the author of ''Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies.'' In a society that values enterprise and making money, he said, ''Just living the life of the writer is a critique of social values.  He becomes an ambiguous figure.''</p>
        <p>In ''Barton Fink,'' John Turturro, playing a Clifford Odets-like character, goes to Hollywood to earn money to support his grand ambitions to found ''a living theater of, about and for the common man,'' as he puts it. Barton is assigned to write a wrestling movie. ''Big men in tights, you know the drill,'' the producer tells him. Barton seeks the advice of the girlfriend of a Faulkner-like novelist who is also toiling in the Hollywood fields. ''Bill's wrestling scenarios are morality tales,'' the woman, played by Judy Davis, tells Barton. ''He'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot man-child.'' Finally, Barton gets something down on paper and he phones his producer. ''I think it's really big -- and important!'' he cries, words most writers have uttered at one time or another.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickstein, who is writing a book on the 30's, when many novelists were lured to Hollywood, said that these films often take the form of ''the revenge movie, where the writer has been called to Hollywood and isn't properly used and appreciated, despite the gigantic amount of money he receives.'' The writer character seems a surrogate for the director who, too, has inevitably been humiliated by Hollywood. He plays out the director's own struggle between art and commerce.</p>
        <p>''There's always a sense of failure or opportunism if you go to Hollywood,'' said Robert Sklar. ''It's a reciprocal disdain.'' In the 1950 movie ''In a Lonely Place,'' Humphrey Bogart portrays a writer-turned-Hollywood-hack who is so bitter that when he is asked to write a screenplay based on a book, he hires a young girl to read the book to him out loud -- and the girl is murdered.</p>
        <p>INDEED, in almost all movies about writers, Hollywood is a metaphor for a writer's hell. In ''Barton Fink,'' Barton works in a dingy hotel room with the wallpaper oozing and peeling ominously off the walls as he types. At one point, John Goodman, the devil disguised as an insurance salesman, appears in Barton's doorway literally engulfed in flames.</p>
        <p>The primary punishment for the writer in hell, be it Hollywood or some other place, is writer's block. ''In 'The Shining,' writer's block leads to insanity,'' said Mr. Dickstein. The writer in the film, played by Jack Nicholson, who has taken a job as the caretaker of an immense, empty hotel, goes mad and types the same sentence over and over again.</p>
        <p>''Writer's block often seems to be implicitly about impotence,'' Mr. Dickstein added. And release from writer's block is often concurrent with sexual release. In ''Beloved Infidel,'' based on the book by the gossip columnist Sheilah Graham about her love affair with Fitzgerald, it only takes a few chaste kisses from her before Fitzgerald is typing away madly.</p>
        <p>It could be the technical difficulties of showing what writers do, or the self-seriousness of the practitioners, but movies about writers are often littered with unintentional howlers. ''An artist should remain poor,'' Cezanne (Vladimir Sokoloff) says solemnly to his friend, Emile Zola (Paul Muni), in ''The Life of Emile Zola.''  ''Otherwise his talent, like his stomach, grows fat and stuffed. I'm sorry, Emile, but I had to say it.''</p>
        <p>''They say an author reveals himself subconsciously in his writings,'' the Sheilah Graham character, played by Deborah Kerr, says in ''Beloved Infidel.''</p>
        <p>In ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,'' Dorothy Parker recites her poetry to the camera in an incomprehensible drawl, meant to emphasize her dissoluteness and depression. ''Oh, do you enjoy Swinburne?'' she asks someone at what is supposed to be a typical literary cocktail party.</p>
        <p>But some of the best howlers of all are in ''Total Eclipse,'' the 1995 film about the love affair between the French poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rimbaud as a bratty teen-ager with grandiose ambitions. ''I want the sun! I want the sun!'' he cries to Verlaine, played by David Thewlis. ''Do you understand me! I want the sun!''</p>
        <p>The most successful of movies about writers are those that make fun of the form's cliches, like ''The Shining.''  ''I'm outlining a new writing project,'' Mr. Nicholson says, with a smile that is a mixture of the bland and the mad. ''And five months of peace is just what I need.'' Every writer, of course, longs for time to write. And, of course, the audience senses that it's going to be five long months of horror.</p>
        <p>EVENTUALLY, ''The Shining'' becomes a dark parody of films about the domestic lives of writers. ''I'm really into my work!'' Nicholson snarls at his wife when she timidly interrupts him. She ends up paying for her timorous demands on him -- in a big way -- when he axes her to death.</p>
        <p>The forthcoming ''Shakespeare in Love'' mocks cliches that abound in writer films. Shakespeare, played by Joseph Fiennes (Ralph Fiennes's younger brother), writes frantically with his quill, scratches his ear while he tries to drum up inspiration and falls asleep over his desk. ''Where is my play!'' Shakespeare's producer demands. ''As soon as I find my muse,'' Shakespeare replies. ''We're at least four acts short, Will, a recipe for disaster!'' the producer tells him.'' What writer hasn't heard some version of those words?</p>
        <p>When Shakespeare goes to his ''weekly confession'' with an astrologer-apothecary, he lies down on the couch and complains as his ''therapist'' says, ''Interesting, interesting,'' and sand trickles through the hourglass marking the time. ''Words, words, words,'' Shakespeare moans. And what writer hasn't said that?</p>
        <p>FILM  Correction:  October 4, 1998, Sunday  An article last Sunday about film portrayals of writers referred incorrectly to a character in ''The Shining.'' The wife of the writer played by Jack Nicholson survives; she is not axed to death by her husband.</p>
