        <p>By authorizing a narrowly defined investigation of whether Harold Ickes committed perjury in Senate testimony about the 1996 election campaign, Attorney General Janet Reno is trying to buy some time and relieve the intense Congressional pressure for an unfettered inquiry into President Clinton's fund-raising. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees, which will interview Ms. Reno today, will not be satisfied with this latest baby step. But they may regard the Ickes inquiry as a sign that Ms. Reno is beginning to yield to the righteous demands from Congress and her own Justice Department that she appoint an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's determination to block an unrestricted inquiry into the Clinton fund-raising machine has been a disaster for the rule of law. Both the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the former chief prosecutor for campaign finance, Charles La Bella, have told her she is defying the Independent Counsel Act by failing to step aside in favor of a prosecutor who does not answer to Mr. Clinton. Her defense of soft-money contributions and expenditures directed by Mr. Ickes and Mr. Clinton guts the Federal Election Campaign Act.</p>

        <p>By authorizing a narrowly defined investigation of whether Harold Ickes committed perjury in Senate testimony about the 1996 election campaign, Attorney General Janet Reno is trying to buy some time and relieve the intense Congressional pressure for an unfettered inquiry into President Clinton's fund-raising. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees, which will interview Ms. Reno today, will not be satisfied with this latest baby step. But they may regard the Ickes inquiry as a sign that Ms. Reno is beginning to yield to the righteous demands from Congress and her own Justice Department that she appoint an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's determination to block an unrestricted inquiry into the Clinton fund-raising machine has been a disaster for the rule of law. Both the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the former chief prosecutor for campaign finance, Charles La Bella, have told her she is defying the Independent Counsel Act by failing to step aside in favor of a prosecutor who does not answer to Mr. Clinton. Her defense of soft-money contributions and expenditures directed by Mr. Ickes and Mr. Clinton guts the Federal Election Campaign Act.</p>
        <p>In a final report before moving to another post, Mr. La Bella urged his boss to authorize the comprehensive investigation by an independent prosecutor. Today the Judiciary Committees will continue their efforts to see the La Bella report and to prod Ms. Reno into action. She is certain to resist because that report will amount to a scorching indictment of her refusal for 18 months to let Federal law enforcement answer fundamental questions about the integrity of the electoral process.</p>
        <p>Looking at a small aspect of Mr. Ickes's testimony about an alleged favor to the teamsters or at the question of whether Vice President Gore lied about his telephone solicitations will not provide those answers. Only a broad examination of illegal foreign contributions, alleged Chinese Government meddling in the election and the possible peddling of White House favors in return for soft-money contributions can restore public confidence and politicians' respect for campaign laws.</p>
        <p>The 90-day preliminary inquiries into Mr. Ickes and Mr. Gore could eventually lead to the appointment of a special counsel by the panel of Federal judges that administers the Independent Counsel Act. But the La Bella report is said to argue that there is ample evidence for a broader, faster inquiry. So far, Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Henry Hyde, chairmen of the two judiciary committees, have treated Ms. Reno with courtesy and more patience than she has earned. Now that she has inched two small steps in the right direction, it is time for them to persuade her to quit sitting on the La Bella report and on the Federal investigators who can do the job she is shirking.</p>
