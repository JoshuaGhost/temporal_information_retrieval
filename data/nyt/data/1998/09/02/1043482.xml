        <p>A three-woman team that was led by Stephanie Wondolleck of San Francisco won the United States women's sailing championship last week on the Fern Ridge Reservoir near Eugene, Ore.</p>
        <p>The event, also known as the Adams Cup, was organized in 1924. This year, it included nine teams that qualified from various regions. Winds were mostly moderate at 6-12 knots. The four-day regatta ended last Saturday. Crews competed in Santana 20 sloops for the nine-race series. Wondolleck and her teammates, Vicki Sodaro and Karina Vogen, represented the San Francisco Yacht Club.</p>
