        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno today ordered an investigation into whether Harold M. Ickes, a former deputy White House chief of staff, committed perjury last year when he testified before a Senate committee examining Democratic campaign fund-raising abuses.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno today ordered an investigation into whether Harold M. Ickes, a former deputy White House chief of staff, committed perjury last year when he testified before a Senate committee examining Democratic campaign fund-raising abuses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno said she had begun a 90-day review that could lead to the appointment of an independent counsel. She said her decision was based on a report by the Senate panel, the Governmental Affairs Committee, that accused Mr. Ickes of misleading the committee about his dealings with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</p>
        <p>The report said evidence and testimony uncovered by the committee contradicted Mr. Ickes's statements that he had been unaware of some White House efforts to intervene on behalf of the Teamsters in a labor dispute with a California company. At the same time, Democrats were trying to enlist the union's support for the re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>The committee concluded in a widely publicized report issued in March that Mr. Ickes himself had asked Administration officials to help settle the dispute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ickes's lawyers issued a statement today saying Mr. Ickes had not broken the law. ''Mr. Ickes has been called upon to testify some 20 times as a result of his three years years of White House service,'' said Robert S. Bennett and Amy Sabrin. ''He has testified truthfully on all occasions.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton said in a statement released on his trip to Russia that Mr. Ickes ''has been a trusted adviser and a dedicated public servant,'' adding, ''I am confident that investigators will find he acted lawfully and appropriately.''</p>
        <p>After 18 months in which she has repeatedly refused Republican demands to refer campaign finance issues to a prosecutor, Ms. Reno's decision indicated that the Justice Department could be shifting its approach. Her decision marked the second time in less than a week that she took a step toward such an appointment for a fund-raising issue.</p>
        <p>Last week, she ordered a three-month inquiry into whether Vice President Al Gore lied to investigators about his fund-raising telephone calls from the White House. Mr. Gore's aides have said his phone calls were proper.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's decision today came on the eve of a potentially pivotal day in Ms. Reno's own tenure. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to confront lawmakers who have denounced her refusals to refer the entire tangle of fund-raising issues to an outside prosecutor. The lawmakers have demanded that she produce a report by Charles G. La Bella, a former top aide who urged her to seek an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>The report by Mr. La Bella, who headed the Justice Department's campaign finance unit, also concluded that Ms. Reno should review Mr. Ickes's activities. Officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Mr. La Bella had uncovered additional evidence against Mr. Ickes. Mr. La Bella is expected to accompany Ms. Reno to the Congressional meeting.</p>
        <p>Today, Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee and has urged Ms. Reno to seek the appointment of an independent counsel, suggested that her inquiry of Mr. Ickes was too narrow. He said the preliminary investigation ''should be followed by a broad-based request for an independent counsel to investigate the entirety of the Democratic campaign finance scandal.''</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials denied that the timing of her decision was an effort to ease the antagonism against her in Congress. These officials said that the decision on launching the review of Mr. Ickes was nearly settled last week, but Ms. Reno delayed the decision until today by asking for more legal analysis.</p>
        <p>The decision suggested that for the first time Ms. Reno had allowed political factors to enter in to her thinking. Until now, Ms. Reno had bluntly dismissed the increasingly exasperated Republican requests for her to invoke the discretionary part of the law, which permits her to seek an outside prosecutor if the subject of an allegation, in this case Mr. Ickes, poses a personal, financial or political conflict of interest. Today Ms. Reno acknowledged for the first time that the case posed such a conflict.</p>
        <p>The statements made by Mr. Ickes that are at issue occurred at a deposition and in a combative appearance before the Senate panel on Oct. 8, 1997. A lawyer and one of the chief designers of the huge fund-raising machine set up in behalf of President Clinton's re-election, Mr. Ickes testified that ''we did what the law allowed,'' saying that he had abided by the letter of the law in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ickes denied that he knew of a plan in which the Democrats were to swap money with the re-election campaign of Ron Carey, then the president of the teamsters' union. Mr. Ickes denied that he knew of any efforts by the White House to help settle a strike at Diamond Walnut Growers, a large food cooperative based in California. The panel's report, though, said internal teamsters' memorandums obtained by the panel showed that Mr. Ickes had asked Mickey Kantor, the former United States Trade Representative, to intervene with a senior Diamond Walnut executive to settle the dispute.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Ickes told the committee that Mr. Ickes had asked her to follow up his conversation with Mr. Kantor to determine whether he had made contact.</p>
