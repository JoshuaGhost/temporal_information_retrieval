        <p>Fox Sports experienced no problem switching from the Braves-Mets game in time to show Mark McGwire's 60th home run yesterday, but it nearly missed showing McGwire's second at-bat.</p>
        <p>The Fox broadcast was in a local commercial break on Channel 5 when it abruptly joined McGwire's second at-bat by jettisoning its last commercials, by which time the count was 2-0. McGwire eventually struck out. Fox joined McGwire's last two at-bats in plenty of time.</p>

        <p>Before the pitch that McGwire hit off the Reds' rookie pitcher Dennis Reyes for his 60th home run, the analyst Tim McCarver said that McGwire had hit eight home runs off rookie pitchers this season. Joe Buck, the play-by-play announcer, noted that McGwire had not hit a home run against the Reds all season.</p>
        <p>''They can't say it anymore,'' Buck said as McGwire swatted Reyes's third pitch to left field. ''Sixty!''  BASEBALL</p>
