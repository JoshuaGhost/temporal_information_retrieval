        <p>High hopes.</p>
        <p>Each National Football League team that kicks off the season today is unbeaten. Each thinks it can win its division. The playoffs dance in each team's head and visions of Super Bowl glory tingle each team's spine.</p>
        <p>And then reality strikes. They have to play the games. And one by one, all but two teams slip, slide and crash. It is a high-stakes dance of huge egos clashing, of old rivalries renewed and new ones created.</p>
        <p>The result is a new order.</p>
        <p>Soon the dominant teams of this decade will give way to that new order. Sweeping change -- franchises moving to new cities, free agency being put in place, a new collective bargaining agreement, $17.6 billion in new television contracts, new coaches, new star players -- have already occurred this decade. And new powerhouses are on the way while old stars begin to fade.</p>
        <p>Among the teams on an immediate upswing are the Baltimore Ravens, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Seattle Seahawks and the Tennessee Oilers in the American Conference, and the Arizona Cardinals, the Minnesota Vikings and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the National Conference.</p>
        <p>These teams are fighting deep water: the Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers in the A.F.C., and the Chicago Bears, Philadelphia Eagles and St. Louis Rams in the N.F.C.</p>
        <p>The league's marquee franchises of the 90's, the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers, face huge obstacles to retaining their lofty stature. Both are older and more injury prone, depleted by free agency losses and in transition from changes in coaches (Dallas) and management (San Francisco).</p>
        <p>After 13 consecutive Super Bowl losses, the A.F.C. finally toppled the N.F.C. when Denver won in January. And the A.F.C. is in position to put together its own string with a more bountiful crop of young, skilled quarterbacks and young, athletic teams.</p>
        <p>Four coaches will face inordinate pressure as the 1998 season unfolds. Dave Wannstedt has little chance to survive in Chicago. Norv Turner is in trouble if his Washington team does not make the playoffs. Dennis Erickson has all the tools to win in Seattle and must. And Ray Rhodes appears at the end of his rope in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>There is a solution for all of them. Get to Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31 at Pro Player Stadium in Miami. And win it. Today's start is exhilarating. But it's all about the finish.</p>
        <p>THE STADIUM GAME During this decade, N.F.L. executives saw that too many of their stadiums were crumbling before their eyes.</p>
        <p>Several have been upgraded to include luxury boxes and suites. Two teams will play in brand-new stadiums, the Ravens and the Buccaneers. The Ravens open their new digs in downtown Baltimore today when they play host to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Buccaneers will wait until they entertain the Chicago Bears on Sept. 20.</p>
        <p>And the Oilers, after having played last season in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, will play at Vanderbilt Stadium near downtown Nashville. Their first game there is Sept. 13 against the Chargers. Next season they move again, into a permanent home, a new stadium in downtown Nashville.</p>
        <p>THE LONG GAME The tendency in the passing game has been to use quicker quarterback drops and quicker throws and shorter passes to offset blitzing defenses. Is this the season that offenses begin to respond with more long passes? It could be.</p>
        <p>It would require more pass protection, keeping in both backs and a tight end to block or a one-back, two-tight end set. A fleet receiver with a dynamic burst is needed. So is a strong-armed quarterback.</p>
        <p>The critical ingredient is a play-caller who has the backbone to make the call and the moxie to know when to make it, catching a defense off stride. One who recognizes a matchup mismatch. The short passing game remains the standard. But there is room for more bombs. So bombs away.</p>
        <p>GOTCHA! One of the amusing and yet infuriating aspects of free agency is signing away other teams' top-notch free agents, especially doing it within your own division, when you can bolster your own squad and weaken a rival. Amusing for the receiver. Infuriating for the giver.</p>
        <p>The Jets did this to the New England Patriots. Running back Curtis Martin left the Patriots to return to his old boss, Bill Parcells, and it added fuel to an already red-hot rivalry among the franchises. Both teams reside in the A.F.C. East.</p>
        <p>Another example was receiver Yancey Thigpen moving from the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Oilers, both of the A.F.C. Central. Steelers players say they will miss Thigpen's big plays and leaping, twisting catches. The Oilers say he gives them a go-to-guy in the passing game.</p>
        <p>Another byproduct of this type of signing is that it gives a team an understanding of the inner workings, in scheme, philosophy, style and preparation, of a divisional opponent. In both of these cases, the receivers (Jets, Oilers) are chasing the more powerful givers (Patriots, Steelers). Used correctly, this ploy is an invaluable asset.</p>
        <p>DEUCES WILD Three duos on three clubs will be worth watching in '98.</p>
        <p>In Buffalo, an unhappy Bruce Smith saw Ted Washington, his mate along the defensive line, sign during the off season for more money than Smith. Smith was hot -- he had signed a new deal last year and now wanted another one, bigger than Washington's. Buffalo refused. Smith said he will play, but not with a smile. It seems that much of the joy of playing is gone for him because of the contract situation.</p>
        <p>Fans see this as arrogant and selfish and stupid. Smith does not understand that. It all falls in the lap of the new head coach, Wade Phillips, who has to get Smith ready to play football.</p>
        <p>In Cincinnati, the Bengals' players are fond of quarterback Jeff Blake. Too bad. Coach Bruce Coslet has named Neil O'Donnell the starter. The players believe in one guy and the coach chooses another. How is this going to play out?</p>
        <p>And in Washington, two huge defensive tackles, Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson, will attempt to plug the Redskins' soft middle. They were a $57.4 million investment for Washington, and Redskin fans are expecting them to provide better defense than the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>IMPACT ROOKIES These are the players most likely to have a sudden impact and win rookie of the year honors:</p>
        <p>*Randy Moss, Vikings, wide receiver -- So many teams passed on him in the draft. He is intent on proving it was a huge mistake. And he is quite capable of doing that.</p>
        <p>*Ryan Leaf, Chargers, quarterback -- He gets off to a faster start than Peyton Manning. He has warm weather in San Diego that will help the passing game and a passing offense more tailored for his skills.</p>
        <p>*John Avery, Dolphins, running back -- He may finally give the Dolphins' ground game gusto. He is quick and runs fluidly in the open field and displays desire.</p>
        <p>*Charles Woodson, Raiders, cornerback -- So talented. Starts immediately. Makes plays.</p>
        <p>*Ahman Green, Seahawks, running back -- Ricky Watters is the featured running back in Seattle, but look for Green to play a spirited role on third-down plays and as a receiver from the backfield.  ON PRO FOOTBALL</p>
