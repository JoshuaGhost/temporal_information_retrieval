        <p>IN 1842 when the old Croton Aqueduct first opened, two men actually traveled the length of the eight-and-a-half-foot-high masonry tunnel in a tiny rowboat. The trip, not for the claustrophobic, took 22 hours. These days, the tunnel is dry, but it is a historic landmark, and many people walk the land above it. Known as Old Croton Trailway State Park, it is a continuous 26.2-mile path, only 6 or so feet wide, which wends from Cortlandt to the Bronx border.</p>
        <p>The landscape, of course, has changed considerably in the last 150 or so years. There are many twists, turns and details to the trail. To guide hikers and strollers along the path, there is now a colorful map and brochure produced as a labor of love by Robert Romagnoli, a professional map maker from Manhattan, for the Friends of the Old Croton Aqueduct, a volunteer organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romagnoli was walking along the trail one day several years ago when he stopped to chat at the site manager's office. ''He discovered I was a map maker, and we began to talk and I realized I could be of help,'' he recalled. He contacted Fred Charles, a photographer who was president of the Friends, and other members of the organization, and began to work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romagnoli first walked the entire trail slowly, taking notes on all of the uneven terrain, the highway intrusions and the many points of historical and architectural interest. Then he translated all the information into bytes in his computer:</p>
        <p>''This is easily the most complex map I've ever done,'' he said. The result is a colorful, informative and highly detailed map, which, given its complexity, is surprisingly easy to read. It shows both the pipe itself and the trail over it and the streets along the way. The brochure also includes descriptions of many points of interest and gives a history of the aqueduct.</p>
        <p>The aqueduct, according to the literature, was built ''in response to the fires and epidemics that repeatedly devastated New York City, owing in part to its inadequate water supply and contaminated wells.'' In 1837 construction began on the elliptical tube, 8 1/2 feet high and 7 1/2 feet wide, brick lined with a coating of hydraulic cement at bridge crossings and outer walls of hammered stone. It was designed on principles dating from Roman times -- the tube is gravity fed, dropping 13 inches a mile, so that a steady stream of water could flow through the tunneled rock.</p>
        <p>''Typically it is partly buried,'' the literature goes on, ''with a telltale mound encasing it; as one learns to read the 'clues,' an understanding of how the tunnel engages the landscape deepens the trail experience.''</p>
        <p>In 1968, the state bought the land and the structures around it from New York City. The route became  Old Croton Trailway State Park and is now a favorite path for walkers, joggers and sightseers.</p>
        <p>As people hike, they people can see ventilators -- strange-looking cylindrical stone towers placed at one-mile intervals to relieve pressure in the system and keep the water fresh. There are also weirs, large masonry structures occurring on the trail at major stream crossings. Until its closing in the late 1800's, these weirs were used to divert flood and waste water from the main flow.</p>
        <p>Also of interest is the large double arch weir in Ossining. Tourists can descend into the tunnel itself (tours are by appointment; call 693-5259). They can see the old brick, feel the dampness and darkness and learn how water traveled through the aqueduct. Other landmarks on the trailway are not directly connected to the processing of water. Among them are the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, built in 1685; Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, founded in 1849; among the famous buried there are Washington Irving, Samuel Gompers and Andrew Carnegie. Also along the trail are Sunnyside, Washington Irving's estate; Villa Lewaro, the neoclassical mansion, which was built by the first self-made female millionaire in the United States, Madame C. J. Walker, and Lyndhurst, the neo-Gothic mansion designed by Alexander Jackson Davis and once owned by the railroad magnate Jay Gould.</p>
        <p>''We feel that by providing this map, we are fulfilling our mission -- to preserve and promote the culture, geography and history of the river communities,'' Mr. Charles said. ''A lot of people refer to 'the aqueduct,' but not everyone knows exactly what it was and what it is.''</p>
        <p>On a more somber note, Paul J. Feiner, Supervisor of the town of Greenburgh, said he is asking the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to install emergency call boxes along the trail. Mr. Feiner said this summer six women were assaulted at various points on the trail. He said he thinks the call boxes are important, especially in secluded stretches; he has not asked for lights because, he said, the call boxes are sufficient.</p>
        <p>Friends of the Croton Aqueduct can receive one map free. For those who wish to buy one, the cost is $4.50, plus 75 cents shipping and handling. Check or money order can be sent to Friends of the Old Croton Aqueduct, Overseer's House, 15 Walnut Street, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. 10522, or one can call 693-4117.</p>
