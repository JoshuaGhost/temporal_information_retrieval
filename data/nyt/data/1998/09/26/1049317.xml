        <p>Bomb Suspect's Associate Sought Uranium, U.S. Says  Federal authorities said a person they described as a senior deputy to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected in last month's bombings of American embassies in Africa, tried to obtain enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in 1993.

        <p>Bomb Suspect's Associate Sought Uranium, U.S. Says  Federal authorities said a person they described as a senior deputy to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected in last month's bombings of American embassies in Africa, tried to obtain enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in 1993. In court papers unsealed in Manhattan, the Government also asserted that Iran, Sudan and Mr. bin Laden had entered into a formal three-way agreement to work against the United States, Israel and the West.

        <p>Yeltsin Appointment Raises Ire  President Boris N. Yeltsin chose a new Finance Minister, ending a search that held world financial markets and national politics in its thrall. But his choice, Mikhail Zadornov, a 35-year-old free-market advocate, prompted a key minister to walk out, and the head of Russia's securities commission resigned. A4</p>
        <p>Shuttle Diplomacy, at Home  Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is preparing to open a round of shuttle diplomacy on American soil, traveling between Washington and the United Nations headquarters in New York, to try to make progress in talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Clinton Administration officials said. A7</p>
        <p>Compromise on Persecution Bill  A bill requiring the Government to punish countries that stifle religion is likely to become law this year, after a compromise was reached to give the President more flexibility. A7</p>
        <p>Election Results in Bosnia  Election results issued by international officials confirmed the victory of an extreme nationalist, Nikola Poplasen, as president of the Serbian half of Bosnia. But results in most other races showed a trend toward moderate politicians, officials said. A6</p>
        <p>Rushdie Expresses Relief  Salman Rushdie said at a news conference that he was confident that the long campaign against his life was over and that nine years of living under a death sentence had clouded his every thought. What he longed for most, he said, was the simple freedom to open his front door and stroll down the street. A7</p>
        <p>German Campaign Nears End  Gerhard Schroder wound up his campaign to replace Helmut Kohl as German Chancellor in tomorrow's national elections, with opinion polls suggesting a very close race. In a speech in Berlin, Mr. Schroder spoke in generalities about his economic plans while trying to appeal to the disenfranchised people of the former East Germany. A6</p>
        <p>A Transatlantic Swim  A 31-year-old Frenchman who set out to swim the Atlantic 71 days ago completed his 3,400-mile journey, coming ashore near Quiberon on the Brittany coast of France. The swimmer, Benoit Lecomte, who now lives in Austin, Tex., set out from Hyannis, Mass. He swam six to eight hours a day in two-hour blocks, stopping to eat and rest on a sailboat. (AP)</p>

        <p>More Americans Losing Health Care Coverage  The number of people without health insurance rose sharply last year, to 43.4 million, and the proportion of Americans lacking coverage reached the highest level in a decade, 16.1 percent, the Census Bureau said. Medicaid rolls are down, and some employers have said they are cutting back health benefits. A1</p>
        <p>Clinton Takes the Offensive  President Clinton, encouraged by polls that suggest a backlash against Congressional Republicans for a seeming preoccupation with the Lewinsky scandal, criticized them for a lack of action on spending bills and other legislation. A1</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones and for President Clinton may reach agreement in the next few days to settle her sexual misconduct lawsuit against him, advisers said. A1</p>
        <p>Democratic Party leaders said a backlash against Republicans was helping to energize supporters, displace apathy and raise money. A11</p>
        <p>House Rejects Fast-Track Bill  The House rejected legislation to give expanded trade negotiating authority to President Clinton. A9</p>
        <p>Storm Pummels Florida Keys  Hurricane Georges, which left nearly 300 people dead in the Caribbean, struck the Florida Keys with winds of over 100 miles per hour, causing flooding and extensive damage but apparently no deaths. Officials extended evacuation directives to a total of 1.4 million people, as the storm moved into the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center forecast that Georges would strengthen later today and a hurricane watch was issued for parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida's gulf coast. A1</p>
        <p>The death toll in the Dominican Republic rose to more than 210, and at least 800 people were missing. In Haiti, 87 bodies were recovered, with the death toll expected to rise. A8</p>

        <p>Relief Effort for Haiti  Haitian immigrants in New York City are scrambling to put together a relief effort for Haiti in the aftermath of Hurricane Georges, and some have expressed dismay at what they see as the slow response of the Giuliani administration. B3</p>

        <p>Hedge Fund's Risks Studied  Long-Term Capital Management, the big hedge fund rescued with a $3.5 billion infusion by a consortium of Wall Street banks this week, made complex bets on international financial markets with a total value considerably higher than previously estimated, said financiers who studied its books. They said that at the end of August the firm had about $2.2 billion in capital. But it borrowed money from banks to purchase securities with a total value of $125 billion, a degree of leverage considered unusually high in the hedge fund world. The financiers said the fund used those securities as collateral to enter into speculative financial contracts valued at $1.25 trillion. A1</p>
