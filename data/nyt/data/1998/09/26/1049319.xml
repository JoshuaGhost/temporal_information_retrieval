        <p>As F.B.I. agents continue their investigation into the bombing of the American Embassy in Kenya last month, they have returned to a fashionable, two-story white house with a red tile roof in this Nairobi suburb, which they combed over after the first suspects were captured.</p>
        <p>On Thursday agents walked around the backyard and examined the two-car garage, talking among themselves about whether it was large enough for a pickup truck, people who were present said today. Small trucks were used in the embassy bombing here and the one in Tanzania on the same day, according to the indictments handed down in New York.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. is intensely interested in the house because in the weeks before the bombing, the tenant was one Haroun Fazil, according to neighbors and the landlady. Mr. Fazil, a citizen of the Comoros, has been charged with having orchestrated the Aug. 7 bombing in Nairobi, which killed 258 people, including 12 Americans.</p>
        <p>The indictment of Mr. Fazil says that he operated out of a ''villa in the vicinity of Nairobi,'' and that it was in the villa that the bomb was built. The indictment does not further identify the villa, but it is in New Runda Estates, a five-year-old development on the edge of Karura Forest about eight miles north of the American Embassy in downtown Nairobi. Most of the residents in the 243 houses are expatriates, working for various agencies of the United Nations, which has its compound on the other side of the forest.</p>
        <p>Judging by his accounts of his activities at the house in the week of the bombing, Mr. Fazil is a man with proverbial nerves of steel. Two days after driving away with his wife and family, he apparently used the same vehicle to lead the bomb-laden vehicle to the embassy. Then after the attack he returned to supervise the cleaning of the house, which had little in it, except for a television.</p>
        <p>But the house, with hardwood floors and a family room that opens through sliding glass doors to a well-kept garden, may not have been cleaned well enough. The F.B.I. found ''large amounts of gray powder,'' which is similar to aluminum power used in bombs, the indictment says.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said young Arab-looking men came and went from No. 43, and that two stayed in the servants' quarters, two small, concrete-floor rooms, with tiny windows, behind the garage.</p>
        <p>One of the men was Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, according to neighbors who identified him from photographs that have appeared in the newspapers and on television here. Mr. 'Owhali has been indicted in connection with the bombing, and has admitted that he drove in the vehicle carrying the bomb to the embassy, and then threw a grenade at the guard before fleeing on foot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazil moved into the house in May, with his wife and their 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son, neighbors recalled. They kept to themselves.</p>
        <p>''They tended to hide,'' said Omega Wycliffe, the night watchman at a property across the street, who said  he had been interviewed by the F.B.I. ''He refused to even let people stand there,'' he said, pointing to the black gate, suspended between white pillars, which opens on to the property. He said the mosque did not want people to see his wife. She was fully covered in black, except for her eyes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazil said his work was ''of the mosque,'' said John Simide, who earned $4 a day as a gardener for Mr. Fazil. ''He didn't seem to want anyone in the house.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazil drove a white Datsun pickup, neighbors said.</p>
        <p>One day, Mr. Fazil said to his gardener, ''I'm going, my work is finished.''</p>
        <p>Then he loaded his wife, two children and ailing father-in-law into the Datsun, drove down the short hill, turned right, right again, up a hill and out of the suburb. That was Wednesday, Aug. 5, Mr. Simide said.</p>
        <p>Two days later Mr. Fazil drove a white pickup truck toward the American Embassy, showing the way for the bomb-laden vehicle that followed, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>The blast at 10:30 that Friday morning was heard in New Runda, though the residents had no idea what it was.</p>
        <p>By noon Mr. Fazil was back at the house and asked Mr. Simide to find a woman to help clean the house.</p>
        <p>While the woman, Pauline Wambui, was sweeping and dusting, Mr. Fazil turned on the television. The news had pictures of the carnage and destruction downtown.</p>
        <p>'' 'It seems there was a bomb in town which destroyed buildings and killed people,' '' Mr. Simide recalled Mr. Fazil saying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazil said he did not have money to pay Mr. Simide. He gave him the television.</p>
        <p>Then he got back in the white pickup and drove off.</p>
