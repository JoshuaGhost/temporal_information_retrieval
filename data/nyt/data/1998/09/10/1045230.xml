        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright hit back today at a former United Nations arms inspector and other critics who have accused her of trying to scuttle inspections of Iraq's weapons sites.</p>
        <p>In a speech to members of the American Legion, Ms. Albright again held out the possibility that the United States would use military force against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein continued to refuse to allow additional weapons inspections.</p>
        <p>''The critics are sincere,'' Ms. Albright said. ''We are, after all, on the same side. But they are sincerely wrong when they blame America for the world's failure to uncover the full truth about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright did not mention by name the former arms inspector, William Scott Ritter Jr., an American, who resigned last month and has accused the Administration of undermining the inspection system.</p>
        <p>But her remarks, in a speech in New Orleans to a convention of the  veterans' group, were clearly a rebuttal to remarks by Mr. Ritter, who testified on Capitol Hill last week that the United States had scuttled the arms inspections in Iraq through ''interference and manipulation, usually coming from the highest levels of the Administration's national security team,'' notably Ms. Albright.</p>
        <p>''In recent weeks, some in Washington have suggested that the United States has not done enough to support the U.N. inspectors -- it has even been suggested that we have tried to prevent Unscom from doing its job,'' Ms. Albright said, using the acronym for the United Nations Special Commission, which is charged with finding and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>''In fact, the United States has been by far the strongest international backer of Unscom,'' she continued. ''We have provided indispensable technical and logistical support. We've pushed and pushed and pushed some more to help Unscom break through the smoke screen of lies and deceptions put out by the Iraqi regime.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Ms. Albright say she is dismayed over the damage that may have been done to her reputation as a result of the controversy created by Mr. Ritter's resignation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright gained early notoriety in the Clinton Administration when, as the American representative to the United Nations, she led efforts to maintain tough economic sanctions on Iraq despite flagging international resolve on the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, has said that the Administration made at least seven efforts since last November to stymie investigations by the Special Commission.</p>
        <p>Last month, Ms. Albright acknowledged that concerns about creating a deep split in the United Nations Security Council had prompted her to question the timing of certain inspections of suspected weapons sites in Iraq.</p>
        <p>In confronting Iraq, it is best ''to be able to choose your own timing and terrain,'' she said today. ''Saddam's tantrums have a political purpose: to spark a reaction, divide the Security Council, isolate the United States and diminish support for sanctions. We have not taken any option off the table, including military force.''</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Ritter has criticized Ms. Albright and others in the Administration, he has faced criticism himself from his two former bosses at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week Richard Butler, the chief United Nations arms inspector for Iraq said Mr. Ritter's testimony on Capitol Hill was often inaccurate in chronology and detail and had damaged the commission.</p>
        <p>And in an interview today, Mr. Butler's predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, who is now Sweden's ambassador to the United States, said Mr. Ritter had sometimes lacked an understanding of the ''big picture'' of dealing with Iraq.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to denigrate him at all, because he's a very, very solid person,'' Ambassador Ekeus said. ''But he's not in a position to know all of the considerations that go into decision making on the commission.'' He said that in his dealings with Ms. Albright, ''I had always found her to be a strong supporter of Unscom.''</p>
        <p>In testimony today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Martin Indyk, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, said Mr. Ritter's allegations against the United States ''had profoundly undermined the perception that Unscom is independent -- and that will make it harder for Unscom to do its job.''</p>

        <p>Warning on Iraq A-Arms</p>
        <p>JERUSALEM, Sept. 9 (Agence France-Presse) -- Iraq is hiding three ''technologically complete'' nuclear bombs that lack only the fissile material to make them operational, Scott Ritter, the former United Nations arms inspector, was quoted today as saying in the newspaper Haaretz.</p>
        <p>Haaretz said Mr. Ritter made the disclosure at a recent closed-door meeting of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ritter was quoted as saying that the United Nations inspections committee knew where the three nuclear devices were being hidden and had information on how they were concealed and which officers were guarding them, but had not received an order to inspect the site.</p>
        <p>He described the bombs as ''technologically complete'' and needing only the fissile nuclear material to become operational. Haaretz made no mention of whether Ritter believes Iraq has obtained any such nuclear material.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ritter, an American citizen, quit the United Nations inspection team in Iraq last month, saying it was no longer carrying out its task  aggressively enough.</p>
        <p>He said the United States wanted to avoid new confrontations with President Saddam Hussein and had intervened to keep the United Nations teams from carrying out surprise inspections.</p>
