        <p>Editorial pays tribute to Akira Kurosawa, Japanese movie director who recently died; says he opened way for Western audiences to consider seriousness of Japanese cinema (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In his autobiography, the director Akira Kurosawa recalled the battles with his producer over the making of ''Rashomon.'' From the outset, the producer complained that audiences would never accept its story about four accounts of a rape and murder, with no hint of which one was correct. Many years later, however, when the film was hailed as one of the greatest of all times, Kurosawa caught that same producer taking full credit for its success. ''I had the feeling I was back in 'Rashomon' all over again,'' the director declared.</p>
        <p>The body of work left by Kurosawa, who died Sunday, is as powerful and influential as that of any other creator in film. He took a cliched Japanese form of the samurai drama and mixed in story lines from Noh theater, Shakespeare, Russian literature, popular detective fiction like Ed McBain's and other sources, using them to reflect on character and choice. His epics were populated by vagabonds, heroes, liars, cheats and cowards fighting or railing at fate. But all the movies are best remembered visually -- the shadowy forests of ''Rashomon,'' the graphic battle scenes in ''Seven Samurai'' or the blasted heath and castle ramparts of ''Ran.''</p>

        <p>Not always popular or understood in his own country, Kurosawa opened the way for Western audiences to consider the seriousness of Japanese cinema. The irony was that many of his films, aimed as homage to Western genres, were remade by Hollywood. Film students will long talk about Kurosawa as a man who changed the nature of movies. But audiences will always respond emotionally to stories that, for all the strangeness of their setting, are as immediate as any ever filmed.</p>
