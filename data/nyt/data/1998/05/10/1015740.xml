        <p>Leora Tanenbaum letter on Kim France April 26 review of Letters to a Young Feminist by Phyllis Chesler (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kim France writes that Phyllis Chesler, the author of ''Letters to a Young Feminist'' (April 26), fails in her mission to pass on the wisdom of second-wave feminists to third-wave feminists because Chesler dwells on the lack of freedoms for women today. France worries that Chesler thereby ''runs the risk of alienating the scores of young women who believe that they have never known anything but freedom'' and says that ''she might as well be writing in Urdu.''</p>
        <p>But it is precisely the young women -- and men -- who smugly shrug away the feminist movement as a relic of the past who need to heed Chesler's message: that despite numerous feminist gains, women continue to face sexual harassment, glass ceilings, double standards, salary discrepancies, deadbeat fathers, domestic violence, evanescent abortion rights and sexist media portrayals of girls and women. If sugarcoating these truths constitutes writing in English, then we should all learn Urdu.</p>
