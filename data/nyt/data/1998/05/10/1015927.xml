        <p>THE first works representing scenes of the New World by European explorer-artists were watercolors. Thus, the art of watercolor painting has a formidable history in America that goes  back to the late 16th century. But not until the mid-1800's was the medium appreciated for its esthetic value and accepted as a means to create an independent work of art rather than to achieve documentation.</p>
        <p>There has always been something magical about watercolor painting. The artist uses what seems to be so little to capture colorful and translucent effects with each carefully placed stroke. At the same time, it is a rather unforgiving medium that does not offer much opportunity to make changes. Nonetheless, contemporary artists continue to be fascinated with and challenged by watercolors.</p>

        <p>THE first works representing scenes of the New World by European explorer-artists were watercolors. Thus, the art of watercolor painting has a formidable history in America that goes  back to the late 16th century. But not until the mid-1800's was the medium appreciated for its esthetic value and accepted as a means to create an independent work of art rather than to achieve documentation.</p>
        <p>There has always been something magical about watercolor painting. The artist uses what seems to be so little to capture colorful and translucent effects with each carefully placed stroke. At the same time, it is a rather unforgiving medium that does not offer much opportunity to make changes. Nonetheless, contemporary artists continue to be fascinated with and challenged by watercolors.</p>
        <p>The Perkins Center for the Arts here and the Hopkins House Gallery in Haddon Township currently have separate watercolor exhibitions with a total of 128 works by 104 artists, calling attention to the diverse talent in the South Jersey-Philadelphia region. Artists were invited to submit a maximum of two works for each show. At Perkins, a broad definition of water media included acrylic; the Hopkins House show accepted mixed materials as long as watercolor dominated. Judi Betts was the guest juror here at Perkins, which has not had a watercolor exhibition for 11 years. Homer Johnson selected the works in the sixth annual watercolor exhibition sponsored by the Camden County Cultural and Heritage Commission. Both jurors are celebrated watercolor artists who hold elected membership in the prestigious American Watercolor Society, founded in 1866.</p>
        <p>Ms. Betts formed a handsome exhibition of 77 paintings without accepting more than one work from any of the 166 artists. Mr. Johnson made his choices from a smaller group of entries to select 51 works by 36 artists. Nine painters are represented in both shows.</p>
        <p>Doree Loschiavo of Philadelphia has the distinction of receiving awards from both jurors. ''Walk in Jazz,'' chosen for the Camden County purchase prize, is a vibrant rendering of a musical combo performing in a Bourbon Street club. At Perkins she received one of 10 cash awards for ''Venetian Overpass,'' a scene that avoids being a sentimental travel souvenir in favor of depicting the hustle of activity in Venice on a raw November morning. Her fluid washes of color convey the directness and spontaneity of both scenes.</p>
        <p>With its attention to detail, ''Lun Chong Grocery,'' by James Toogood of Cherry Hill, is a virtuoso demonstration of brush control, using watercolor to suggest the illusion of a photograph of a Chinatown market in Philadelphia. Unlike the camera lens, the artist manipulates reality so that reflections are heightened and only selected words are legible. Along with his captivating technical display, Mr. Toogood's spatial composition has all the classic qualities of a Poussin painting. A markedly different approach is the painterly application of acrylic in ''Spring Orchard,'' by Louis Pontone of Princeton. The brush strokes like individual petals create a patterned design of color and dappled light. The decorative effect almost camouflages the foreground birds, bringing to mind a landscape as it might have been painted by Vuillard.</p>
        <p>Lois Lewis Schumm of Cherry Hill created a richly saturated painting called ''Starry Night,'' one of the funkiest pictures in the Perkins show. Framed on three sides by houses reminiscent of a shtetl, the sky is filled with calligraphic designs of various body parts, animals and geometric shapes inspired by a diverse range of sources. The artist creates extraordinary constellations, and her accents of acrylic in fluorescent and metallic colors heighten the dramatic impact of the celestial realm.</p>
        <p>In a different technical direction, Sally Brandenburg of Holmdel works with wrinkled and moistened Japanese rice paper glued over the watercolor paper to create a delicate, abstract still life. Ms. Brandenburg's process produces a soft-focus image of colors absorbed by the layers of paper, giving it the look of batik-dyed fabric.</p>
        <p>O NLY eight miles away is the smaller exhibition at Hopkins House, where many images are delightful scenes of narrative charm. Picturesque views, like ''Riverton Flags,'' by Arleen B. Potter of Cherry Hill, or ''Monhegan'' by Julie Zahn of Philadelphia, reflect traditional watercolor painting. The former emphasizes the Victorian character of Riverton, Burlington County, without any hint of the 20th century, while the latter is a view of the island off the Maine coast, an attractive summer destination for artists since the late 1800's.</p>
        <p>In addition to the purchase award to Ms. Loschiavo, Mr. Johnson selected four cash prizes, which were ranked rather than equally disbursed like those at the Perkins show. The first prize was an inspired choice given to William M. Hoffman Jr., an art professor at Rutgers University-Camden. ''Geranium and Trumpet Vine'' is a cropped view of Mr. Hoffman's backyard in Woodlynne. The potted geranium plant is set against a tapestry of variegated greens of the sprawling trumpet vine, accented by its delicate orange blossoms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's other decisions are somewhat capricious. Sherman C. Ward Jr. of Haddonfield received a fourth prize for ''Twilight,'' whose very Turneresque sky overwhelms the lower portion of the marine subject. On the other hand, Mr. Ward's ''Spring Snow'' is a more fully realized and intriguing piece that looks like a Japanese print, not a painting. It is unfortunate that Grace Bracegirdle was overlooked, for she definitely deserved recognition. Both her still lifes are exquisite images that reveal solid technical competency along with a strong sense of compositional design. In fact, ''Persimmons and Parasols'' at Hopkins House is as good as, if not better than, ''All Stars,'' for which she received an award at Perkins.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these two South Jersey shows offer a rich regional survey of watercolor painting. What might seem effortless just adds to the allure, and no other medium is so well suited for springtime enjoyment. Here, the phrase watered down is given a good name.</p>

        <p>ART REVIEW  Correction:  May 17, 1998, Sunday  A picture caption last Sunday with a review of two watercolor exhibitions in South Jersey misidentified the gallery exhibiting ''Walk in Jazz,'' by Doree Loschiavo. It is the Hopkins House in Haddon Township, not the Perkins Center for the Arts in Moorestown.</p>
