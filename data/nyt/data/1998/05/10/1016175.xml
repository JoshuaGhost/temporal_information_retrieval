        <p>Letter from Rachel Moore and Michael Taussig, relating to May 4 article on problems with cacao trees, says only since pesticides were introduced have plagues devastated chocolate crop</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Contrary to the statement that ''little is known about how best to grow'' cacao trees (front page, May 4), peasant farmers have long been replicating rain-forest conditions on small farms. Runaway slaves were doing just that in Colombia's Cauca Valley since around 1800. Their descendants maintained that diversity without pesticides until the 1960's, when sugar plantations financed by the United States and Colombian governments rebuilt the region's agriculture. Only since then have plagues devastated the chocolate crop. That the peasants now turn out to have been right all along should be acknowledged. And not just so biologists can figure out a way to take advantage of the peasant wisdom that remains.</p>
        <p>RACHEL MOORE  MICHAEL TAUSSIG  New York, May 6, 1998</p>
        <p>The writers are, respectively, a film scholar and a professor of anthropology at Columbia University.</p>
