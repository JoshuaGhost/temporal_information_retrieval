        <p>As writers reach into their memories and imaginations, New Jersey turns up in a variety of guises. Here are excerpts from a variety of books that appealed to editors of this section.</p>
        <p>In the novel ''Election'' by Tom Perrotta,  a student-body election goes haywire.</p>
        <p>ALL I ever wanted to do was teach. I never had to struggle like other people with the question of what to do with my life. My only dream was to sit on the edge of my desk in front of a room full of curious kids and talk about the world.</p>
        <p>The election that turned me into a car salesman took place in the spring of 1992, when Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were still fresh in everyone's mind, and Gennifer Flowers was the momentary star of tabloids and talk shows. All year long my junior Current Events class returned again and again to a single theme, what the media liked to call ''The Character Issue'': How are private virtue and public responsibility intertwined? Can you be an adulterer and a good President? A sexual pervert and an effective, impartial member of the judiciary?</p>
        <p>It's fair to say that these questions interested me more than my students. Like most American adolescents, the kids at Winwood High didn't pay too much attention to the Supreme Court or the race for the White House. Their concerns were narrower -- school, sports, sex, the unforgiving politics of the hallway and locker room.</p>
        <p>But we also had the Glen Ridge rape case to discuss. My students were fascinated by this sad and sordid story, and it became the nexus where their concerns linked up with those of the larger democracy. The case had not yet gone to trial at this point, but the kids at Winwood knew the details inside and out. A group of high school athletes -- the golden boys of Glen Ridge -- had been charged with luring a retarded girl into a basement, forcing her to commit a variety of sexual acts, and then penetrating her vagina with a broomstick and a baseball bat. None of the defendants denied the event had occurred. Their defense was that the girl had consented.</p>
        <p>We had developmentally disabled kids at Winwood, and we had football heroes, too; the gap between them was immense, almost medieval. It wasn't too hard to imagine how a lonely, mildly retarded girl might consider it a privilege of sorts to be molested and applauded by the jock royalty of her little world. They were the ones with the power of conferring recognition and acceptance. If they saw you, you existed.</p>
        <p>Given the similarities between Winwood and Glen Ridge -- we were only separated by a couple of exits on the Parkway -- it didn't really surprise me that the overwhelming majority of my class, girls included, sided with the defendants and their right to a good time. If a girl, even a retarded girl, was dumb enough to join a troop of red-blooded boys in a basement, then who could blame the boys for taking advantage of this windfall?</p>
        <p>I had my own opinion of the defendants -- I wanted to see them convicted and sent to prison, where they could find out for themselves what it meant to be scared and weak and lonely -- but I kept it to myself in the classroom, opting instead for the more neutral roles of moderator and devil's advocate.</p>
        <p>''They were strong and she was weak,'' I pointed out. ''So don't the strong have a responsibility not to hurt or humiliate the weak?''</p>
        <p>Lisa Flanagan ventured the first response. She was exactly the kind of kid I was trying to reach, a smart, unhappy girl who wanted nothing more than to be accepted by the jock/cheerleader aristocracy at Winwood and had no idea -- how could she? -- of how relieved she was going to be to find a different world in college, more charitable standards of value.</p>
        <p>''Mr. M.,'' she said helpfully, as if cluing me in to the true nature of the world, ''That's not how it works. The strong take what they want.''</p>
        <p>I raised my eyebrows.</p>
        <p>''Might makes right, Lisa? Is that what you're trying to tell me?'' I pointed at Dino Mikulski, the steroid monster in our midst, a 285-pound brick of zits and muscle who already had major college football coaches drooling over their playbooks. ''If you're correct in your analysis, then I move that Dino be declared President of the United States. I have no doubt that he could take George Bush in a fair fight and therefore deserves to be our leader.''</p>
        <p>Lisa got my point. Her face tightened with dismay as Dino and his lackeys exchanged high fives, celebrating his sudden ascension to the leadership of the Free World. I was pleased to see Paul Warren's hand shoot up.</p>
        <p>''Those Glen Ridge guys are scum,'' he declared, silencing the room with the force of his judgment. ''That girl didn't deserve what they did to her.''</p>
        <p>If I had to stick a pin in the map of the past and say, There, that's where it all started, I guess I'd choose that moment.</p>
