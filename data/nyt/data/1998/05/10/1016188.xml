        <p>Major league baseball and ESPN are in a standoff over September games that could land in court.</p>
        <p>Baseball officials do not want Sunday night games in September shifted to ESPN2 from ESPN, which acquired the full Sunday night package of National Football League games. ''Obviously, we're very concerned,'' said Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner.''The Septmber games are very meaningful to us. We're in the midst of a revival, and these are very important.''</p>
        <p>Baseball officials do not want to see potential pennant-race games moved from ESPN, which is available in 74 million households, to ESPN2, available in 57 million households. Lawyers for ESPN and baseball, negotiating since the N.F.L. deal in January, have not worked out a solution, and the correspondence between them has heated up in recent weeks. ESPN's deal with baseball expires in 2002.</p>
        <p>ESPN said it did not the view the planned shift of the games to ESPN2 as a problem. By September, ESPN2 will be in 60 million homes and is a major player on the sports scene, said Chris LaPlaca, an ESPN spokesman.</p>
        <p>The New York Post reported yesterday that baseball might take its cable deal to Turner Sports, which has room on TNT in September with the loss of its half-season N.F.L. package to ESPN.</p>
