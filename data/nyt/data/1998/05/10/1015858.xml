        <p>AT Caramoor in Katonah, Mother's Day is being observed today starting at 2 P.M. with the opening of an exhibition of costumes from the collection of Lucie and Walter Rosen, the original owners of the estate. Then at 3 P.M. the singer-pianist Larry Woodard offers a cabaret show of ''Songs for Mothers and Others.'' After the musicale, listeners are promised a lavish tea amid ''the regal splendor'' of the Italian Pavilion. Admission is fairly regal, too: $50, $25 for children under 16.</p>
        <p>More modestly appointed recitals are also on today's schedule. At 1 P.M. the Meridian String Quartet brings music by Schumann, Shostakovich and Juan Arriaga, the precocious Spanish composer who died in 1826, 10 days before his 20th birthday, to Lyndhurst in Tarrytown. Later in the afternoon the young Chinese pianist Ren Zhang plays at the Sundays at 5 series at Wainwright House in Rye, offering works by Scarlatti, Schubert, Liszt and Godowsky.</p>
