        <p>Is Warren E. Buffett selling part or all of his huge position in zero-coupon Treasury bonds? That is the question bond traders across Wall Street are asking, as huge sell orders pour in on the same long-term Treasury issues that Mr. Buffett owns.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Buffett's policy not to comment on any trades he may be making. And one trader reports that Mr. Buffett's people say they are not selling any of the roughly $20 billion in zero-coupon bonds purchased last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Mr. Buffett's investment company. But such a response would be typical for any large investor interested in keeping his strategies under wrap.</p>

        <p>Is Warren E. Buffett selling part or all of his huge position in zero-coupon Treasury bonds? That is the question bond traders across Wall Street are asking, as huge sell orders pour in on the same long-term Treasury issues that Mr. Buffett owns.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Buffett's policy not to comment on any trades he may be making. And one trader reports that Mr. Buffett's people say they are not selling any of the roughly $20 billion in zero-coupon bonds purchased last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Mr. Buffett's investment company. But such a response would be typical for any large investor interested in keeping his strategies under wrap.</p>
        <p>Zero-coupon bonds are obligations of the United States Treasury that pay no interest but are bought at a deep discount to their value at maturity, or so-called face value. The bonds inch up in price as they get closer to maturity. But their prices also move much more rapidly than interest-bearing bonds when interest rates change.</p>
        <p>Bond traders are speculating that Mr. Buffett may be selling because of the size of the trades and the particular issues involved. In the last couple of weeks, some $5 billion face value of the 2020 and 2021 maturities that Mr. Buffett owns have been sold, an enormous amount to be concentrated in just a couple of issues.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to keep the trades quiet, perhaps, bond traders say the sell orders are going to only one Wall Street firm, Credit Suisse First Boston. Spreading the trades to firms up and down the Street would draw attention.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Buffett is getting out of bonds, he is not alone. Bond traders have seen waves of selling in recent days as pension funds, insurance companies and money managers fret about a possible rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
        <p>David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said that although the Fed is holding steady at the moment, the longer-run picture looks bearish for bonds.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's report of a historically low unemployment rate in April and Thursday's report on productivity and unit labor costs both indicate that wage pressures are building in the United States.</p>
        <p>Employment costs are an inflation signal that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, watches closely.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter productivity rose only two-tenths of 1 percent, versus 1.4 percent in the last quarter of 1997. Unit labor costs rose 3.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buffett certainly has enormous profits in his zero-coupon trade.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning of the year, long-term bonds have risen in price around 50 basis points, or one-half of one percentage point.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Buffett has sold one-quarter of his position in the last three weeks, as one bond trader suspects, then his profits for the last few months could exceed $100 million. Not a bad trade for a man who until recently was famously bond averse.</p>
