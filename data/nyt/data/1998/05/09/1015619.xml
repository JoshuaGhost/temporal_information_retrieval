        <p>Bowing to the wishes of consumers, the Government announced today that it would not allow food to be labeled ''organic'' if it was genetically engineered, irradiated or grown in soil fertilized with sewage sludge.</p>
        <p>The action came in response to comments from tens of thousands of consumers concerned about the purity of their food and the integrity of the organic label.</p>
        <p>Producers and consumers of organic food rejoiced at the decision. ''It's a delightful surprise,'' said Katherine T. DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association, which represents 800 companies that grow and sell organic food products.</p>
        <p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said biotechnology, irradiation and sludge fertilizer were safe and had ''important roles to play in agriculture.'' But, Mr. Glickman said, ''they neither fit current organic practices nor meet current consumer expectations about organics.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, he said, food produced with these techniques ''will not be allowed to bear the organic label.''</p>
        <p>Growers had asked Congress to regulate organic food to preserve the integrity of the organic label, which they said was used so promiscuously it had begun to lose some of its meaning.</p>
        <p>In addition, organic growers wanted national standards because they were subject to conflicting state standards.</p>
        <p>Organic foods have become a large industry, with more than $3.5 billion in sales last year. Sales have soared in the last decade as baby boomers seek food produced with natural techniques.</p>
        <p>In December, the Agriculture Department proposed rules setting the first Federal standards for organic food, covering everything from inspection procedures to compliance testing. But it took no position on whether food produced with biotechnology, radiation or sewage sludge would qualify as organic, inviting public comment on those matters. It received more than 200,000 comments, overwhelmingly opposing the use of the organic label on such foods.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glickman said today that the department would revise its proposals and invite public comment again before issuing final rules with the force of law.</p>
        <p>Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, said: ''This is a tremendous victory for consumers. The department listened to consumers instead of agribusinesses that wanted to blur the distinction between organic foods and conventional food. I can't remember any case in which the department made such an abrupt turnabout.''</p>
        <p>Explaining the fierce public reaction, Mr. Cook said: ''Organic food stores are no longer just little co-ops with tofu and bean sprouts. These are major companies. They alerted their customers, and the customers rejected the proposed rules.''</p>
        <p>The rules were intended to carry out a 1990 law, the Organic Foods Production Act. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, a co-author of the law, said the Agriculture Department had ''fumbled badly'' on the first try in issuing the proposed rules.</p>
        <p>''Consumers need to have confidence that the organic label means what they think it means,'' Mr. Leahy said today.</p>
        <p>The period for public comment ended on April 30. Andrew I. Solomon, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, said Mr. Glickman moved swiftly to announce his decision on the ''big three'' issues because ''we wanted to send a signal to the public and to the organic community that we will end up with rigorous, credible standards.''</p>
        <p>More than half of the public comments were form letters and cards, Mr. Solomon said. But many were heartfelt pleas.</p>
        <p>In a typical letter commenting on the proposed rules, Douglas White of Seattle, wrote: ''As a consumer of organic foods, I would like to register my distress as to the possible inclusion of bioengineered, irradiated and sludge-grown foods to be labeled as organic. These are the very types of foods I'm trying to avoid by buying organic.''</p>
        <p>Another consumer, Wendy Matheisen of California, complained that the rules were not strict enough. ''I may no longer be able to discern whether my organic produce is truly what I have come to expect it to be -- free of genetic engineering, hormones, pesticides and irradiation,'' she wrote.</p>
        <p>William R. Knudsen, chairman of Smucker Quality Beverage, a unit of the J. M. Smucker Company of Orrville, Ohio, welcomed today's decision. But, he said, it is unfortunate that the Government took so long to realize that irradiation, genetic engineering and sludge are ''not properly part of organic agriculture.''</p>
        <p>Smucker buys organic products -- grapes, apples, apricots, peaches -- from certified growers and turns them into fruit juices, jams and jellies. Organic products often sell for higher prices because they cost more to produce, Mr. Knudsen noted.</p>
        <p>In the proposed rules, the Agriculture Department noted that ''there has been an increase in the incidence of food-borne illness.'' Irradiation is used to kill potentially harmful bacteria and parasites and to increase the shelf life of food, but many consumers said it was not compatible with organic farming.</p>
        <p>''Consumers expect organic to mean 'produced naturally,' '' said Mike Menchetti of the Puget Consumers Co-op in Washington State.</p>
