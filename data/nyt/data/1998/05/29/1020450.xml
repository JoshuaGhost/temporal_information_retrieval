        <p>Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' always sounds strange. Its voice -- the voice of the soloist who declaims elegantly crafted nightmare poems in a manner between speech and song -- comes from somewhere unfamiliar, a place known only to this piece. The voice speaks of sexual obsession, cruelty and blasphemy, of lurid visions and black practical jokes. It does not seem to have heard of normal behavior, nor does it take the bizarre events and feelings it describes entirely seriously. A psychiatrist might want to describe it as the voice of a paranoid; and contrary to popular belief, there are not too many authentic psychotics among the characters presented to us by music and opera.</p>
        <p>If this is madness, though, there is method in it. On Tuesday evening at the Pierpont Morgan Library, in a performance conducted by James Levine, the accompanying music for mixed quintet sounded as weird as it has to, but also lustrous and suave a lot of the time. Schoenberg's sense of instrumental character and color was very much in evidence, whether in Rafael Figueroa's grand phrases on the cello or Mike Parloff's cool flute tones and spiky piccolo. The performance also had the special benefit of Peter Serkin at the piano, crisp and crystalline in the high register to which Schoenberg often resorts at the mention of moonlight or glass in the poems, rock hard, enclosed and solid in the bass.</p>

        <p>Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' always sounds strange. Its voice -- the voice of the soloist who declaims elegantly crafted nightmare poems in a manner between speech and song -- comes from somewhere unfamiliar, a place known only to this piece. The voice speaks of sexual obsession, cruelty and blasphemy, of lurid visions and black practical jokes. It does not seem to have heard of normal behavior, nor does it take the bizarre events and feelings it describes entirely seriously. A psychiatrist might want to describe it as the voice of a paranoid; and contrary to popular belief, there are not too many authentic psychotics among the characters presented to us by music and opera.</p>
        <p>If this is madness, though, there is method in it. On Tuesday evening at the Pierpont Morgan Library, in a performance conducted by James Levine, the accompanying music for mixed quintet sounded as weird as it has to, but also lustrous and suave a lot of the time. Schoenberg's sense of instrumental character and color was very much in evidence, whether in Rafael Figueroa's grand phrases on the cello or Mike Parloff's cool flute tones and spiky piccolo. The performance also had the special benefit of Peter Serkin at the piano, crisp and crystalline in the high register to which Schoenberg often resorts at the mention of moonlight or glass in the poems, rock hard, enclosed and solid in the bass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serkin's playing also helped bring out how much method Schoenberg displayed in filling the music with cross-references of theme and motif, quite outside the couple of movements written in strict polyphonic forms. Mr. Levine was with him in this. Because the movements were made to flow together, with barely a beat of a pause from one to the next, they bounced off each other. Without intermittent completions, the music stayed alive. And its textures were alive as well as beautiful.</p>
        <p>The voice above and within them was that of Christine Schafer, the outstanding Pierrotiste of the moment. She did not have much need of the score in front of her. Sometimes she seemed to be making it up as she went along, thinking a phrase before uttering it. There was immediacy, too, in her use of a huge range of vocal timbres, from barely tuned speaking to almost song. Yet she was true to the music throughout, and true to this performance of it, to the delicacy and the Rococo flourishes Mr. Levine had his players discover.</p>
        <p>The performance was given as part of the imaginative series ''The Collection in Concert,'' with which scores from the library's holdings are brought to life. And this was the strangest moment of all, to walk out of the recital room and see Schoenberg's manuscript, very neatly laid out and with the markings he made as conductor of the first run of performances, the pages looking so ordinary.
