        <p>Following are excerpts from a petition filed with the Supreme Court by the independent counsel's office seeking a quick review of a White House appeal of a Federal court decision that compelled grand jury testimony by two Presidential aides who had sought to invoke executive privilege:</p>
        <p>1.  This case is of high moment. It is strongly in the nation's interest that the case be resolved quickly so that the grand jury's investigation can move forward at the earliest practicable date. If the decision below were to proceed through the normal processes of appellate review, important portions of this investigation would be substantially delayed. The need for expedition of this aspect of the United States' investigation has been widely acknowledged, including by respondents.</p>
        <p>This case presents a direct challenge by the Office of the President to the ability of a Federal grand jury to obtain relevant evidence of possible criminal activity by executive branch officials. In cases presenting issues of similar significance, this Court has granted a writ of certiorari before final judgment in the court of appeals ''because of the public importance of the issues presented and the need for their prompt resolution.'' Immediate consideration by this Court would not sacrifice any benefits of intermediate appellate review. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit have heretofore considered and ruled on the main legal issues presented for review. In addition, the district court's opinion thoroughly analyzes the relevant issues.</p>
        <p>2.  The principal legal issues in this case are resolved either directly or by necessary inference from this Court's decision in United States v. Nixon. But the President disagrees. As with Nixon, therefore, this case is exceedingly important.</p>
        <p>In particular, because the President has invoked executive privilege to prevent Messrs. Lindsey and Blumenthal from testifying, this litigation involves fundamental constitutional issues arising out of the doctrine of separation of powers. The invocation of executive and other privileges in this context also presents a question of overriding concern to the full and impartial administration of justice: the circumstances under which the executive branch may withhold information from a Federal grand jury investigating allegations of misconduct against the President, other executive branch officials and various private individuals.</p>
        <p>3.  In United States v. Nixon, this Court held that the applicability of executive privilege turns on the nature of the proceeding and the substance of the information sought. ''Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets,'' the President's ''generalized interest in confidentiality cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.'' Thus, in a criminal investigation, executive privilege simply does not justify withholding of information outside the realm of documents or communications that implicate military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets.</p>
        <p>The Office of the President has previously argued that, notwithstanding Nixon, the prosecutor and grand jury cannot obtain relevant information from the Office of the President without demonstrating a critical need for the information. The standard proposed by the Office of the President is flatly inconsistent with the decision in Nixon. In any event, any standard of heightened relevance is abundantly satisfied on the facts of this case, as the district court correctly concluded.</p>
        <p>The executive privilege claim in this case also fails at a more basic and threshold point. Under Nixon, executive privilege applies only to conduct and communications made in furtherance of a President's Article II duties. Executive privilege is, by its nature, a governmental privilege that stems from the President's powers under Article II. It cannot and should not be asserted to deny the grand jury evidence of communications about private conduct, particularly in the absence of a showing that the communications about private conduct were in furtherance of a specified Article II function. The communications at issue in this case -- discussions relating to or arising out of a private civil case involving the President in his personal capacity -- fall outside that ambit.</p>
        <p>4.  The Office of the President also has advanced claims of governmental attorney-client and work product privilege. The Office of President contends that it can assert such privileges against a Federal grand jury to the same extent as a corporation. No constitutional provision, statute, rule, regulation or case supports that bold assertion. But the Office of the President has refused to acquiesce, persisting month after month in resisting grand jury subpoenas on this basis.</p>
        <p>These common-law privilege claims are flawed for at least two reasons. First, Congress has spoken.  Section 535(b) of Title 28 requires that ''any information, allegation or complaint received in a department or agency of the executive branch'' be ''expeditiously reported'' to the Attorney General or other designated official. Section 535(b) trumps any common-law privilege asserted under Rule 501. Second, even apart from 535(b), this Court's decision in Nixon contravenes any governmental attorney-client privilege in Federal grand jury proceedings. In Nixon, the executive privilege for Presidential communications -- a privilege that is constitutionally based, historically rooted and ''fundamental to the operation of Government,''  -- was overcome by the need for relevant evidence in criminal proceedings. It is untenable to say that communications that fall within the executive privilege are less worthy of protection in criminal proceedings than are communications between a Government employee and Government attorney. The district court correctly concluded that a governmental attorney-client or work product privilege can be no broader than executive privilege.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>The petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment should be granted.</p>
