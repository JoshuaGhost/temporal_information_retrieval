        <p>What disturbs me about ''The Most Religious Century'' (Op-Ed, May 24) is the sophistry of Michael Novak's arguments. Norman Mailer and Vaclav Havel are turning to religion, so it must follow that if unlikely cultural and political icons are doing it, well, the rest of us wouldn't want to be left behind.</p>

        <p>Mr. Novak writes: '' 'There must be more to it than this!' is the essential cry of the human heart.'' Of course. Every society has created religions to satisfy that need. These religions, strangely enough, haven't always been successful in preventing the ''unspeakable abuses against humanity'' to which Mr. Novak refers.  Religion is a belief in belief. Anyone who needs it should have it, made to order. The history of the world has been shaped by the intolerance of believers toward those who believe differently, or who choose not to believe at all.</p>
