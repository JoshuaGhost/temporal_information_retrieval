        <p>''We jazz June.''</p>
        <p>-- Gwendolyn Brooks,</p>
        <p>''We Real Cool'' (1960)</p>
        <p>June is the month for buying air conditioners, finishing school, getting married and, ah, spotting June bugs. It's also the month for jazz in New York City, and this year two of the biggest American jazz events, the JVC Jazz Festival and the Texaco New York Jazz Festival, have for the first time arranged themselves in sequential order, so concertgoers don't have to miss good music while festival promoters wrestle for pre-eminence. It's a welcome break from last year, when the simultaneous scheduling was a no-win situation.</p>

        <p>''We jazz June.''</p>
        <p>-- Gwendolyn Brooks,</p>
        <p>''We Real Cool'' (1960)</p>
        <p>June is the month for buying air conditioners, finishing school, getting married and, ah, spotting June bugs. It's also the month for jazz in New York City, and this year two of the biggest American jazz events, the JVC Jazz Festival and the Texaco New York Jazz Festival, have for the first time arranged themselves in sequential order, so concertgoers don't have to miss good music while festival promoters wrestle for pre-eminence. It's a welcome break from last year, when the simultaneous scheduling was a no-win situation.</p>
        <p>Banking on the hunch that tourists in town for Texaco (Monday through June 14) and JVC (June 15 through 27) will seek out even more acts beyond the festivals' confines, jazz clubs have booked splendid weeks of music. And if that weren't enough, an upstart festival on the Lower East Side from June 24 through Aug. 16 has materialized at the last possible moment.</p>
        <p>(Coincidentally, a separate festival, the Lower East Side Festival for the Arts, will offer jazz performances, among many other events, this weekend.)</p>
        <p>All in all, it's a mind-bogglingly rich array of jazz, which by festival-promoter definitions includes Cuban music, Brazilian music, soul and experimental jazz-based improvising.</p>
        <p>It's so much the better for the non hairsplitters of New York who know good music when they hear it.</p>
        <p>You may have to go beyond what you know, but you'll find a great concert every night in June.</p>
        <p>Here are my recommendations: a suggested calendar of jazz.</p>
        <p>Monday</p>
        <p>McCOY TYNER TRIO,  TriBeCa Hall. Mr. Tyner is the living mainline of jazz, the definer of modern jazz harmony, the course that developing players must pass through. Despite some lackluster recent albums, he's worth hearing in performance; he is still the music's deepest colorist and gets a great thunderous ring out of his piano.</p>
        <p>Tuesday</p>
        <p>DEWEY REDMAN PROJECT,  Knitting Factory. The tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman contributed some riveting solos to Tom Harrell's new album, like communications from the dark, the shadowy end of the saxophone language. Mr. Harrell will return the favor by playing with Mr. Redman in a quartet likely to offer a stunning performance, with the drummer Matt Wilson, the pianist Charles Eubanks and the bassist John Mehegan.</p>
        <p>Wednesday</p>
        <p>MARK DRESSER WITH MIYA MASAOKA AND IKUE MORI,  Knitting Factory, Old Office. Texaco is presenting  a few mini-series within its series, built around a single musician-composer. One is the bassist Mark Dresser, a pan-stylist whose profoundly resonant bass tones and rhythmic virtuosity increases the value of whatever band he joins. This one performs on the first of four consecutive nights of Dresseriana.</p>
        <p>Thursday</p>
        <p>M-BASE FOCUS: STEVE COLEMAN AND FIVE ELEMENTS; GREG OSBY FOUR; GRAHAM HAYNES AND TONES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY; M-BASE COLLECTIVE,  Knitting Factory, Main Space. M-Base, the collective of improvisers founded in 1983, was the brainchild of Steve Coleman. Typically, the music that came out of the collective fused funk and hard-blowing jazz, putting them in curiously compelling rhythm schemes. It was a new direction, and Mr. Coleman doesn't seem likely to give up in his pursuit of more new directions.</p>
        <p>Greg Osby's sound on alto saxophone is related to Mr. Coleman's in its brightness and purity, and its easy familiarity with funk time, but in performance he plays his ideas as fast as Bud Powell, Charlie Parker or any of the other fast be-boppers. For the moment, Graham Haynes has turned his attention away from jazz and toward ambient music in multimedia presentations; he's a talented cornetist, and it's hard to predict his latest turn.</p>
        <p>June 5</p>
        <p>CHUCHO VALDES,  Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South. After a few false starts, an agreement was sealed in January that one of the world's great virtuosic pianists, Chucho Valdes, would play two consecutive weeks at the Village Vanguard. This is important, because Mr. Valdes has never brought his musicians from Cuba for a stretch in a major American jazz club, and the slowly seeping influence he has had on New York musicians during his brief visits might now take on the force of a gusher. Expect the crowd to be thick with musicians as he and his quartet play their cross of jazz and Cuban song forms. June 2 to June 7; June 9 to June 14; $20; a $10 drink minimum.</p>
        <p>June 6</p>
        <p>JOHN ZORN-MILFORD GRAVES DUO; SUN RA SUPER SET ARKESTRA,  Hudson Tent. This is a double bill of mystical and gestural improvising. Mr. Zorn and Mr. Graves haven't collaborated before, but there's reason for high expectations. Both are hyper-alert and forceful abstractionists on their instruments. Mr. Zorn plays alto saxophone, and Mr. Graves a battalion of percussion and his own chanting voice.</p>
        <p>Since the death of its leader in  1997, the Sun Ra band hasn't been able to play many spaces big enough to brandish its full complement of dancers and percussionists. Here it will have the works: 24 pieces playing Africanized Disney-movie music and cheery odes to the solar system.</p>
        <p>June 7</p>
        <p>GEORGE CLINTON AND P-FUNK,  Hudson Tent. PEACOCK-MOTIAN-BLEY,  Main Space, Knitting Factory. Best to hear P-Funk when you can. The band used to celebrate decadence and deep grooves, but in these times of electronic funk, it simply celebrates the sacrament of ecstatic live performance. Returning to the Apollonian world, a trio that gave rise to some of Keith Jarrett's small-group concepts and directly or indirectly to an enormous amount of subsequent jazz, also performs.</p>
        <p>Gary Peacock, Paul Motian and Paul Bley's collective art is incredibly subtle, like trying to rearrange particles in the air. Yet it's full of personality, not at all vapidly meditative; the trio can connote frustration and earthy humor as well as the stellar flux.</p>
        <p>June 8</p>
        <p>MEDESKI MARTIN &amp; WOOD WITH DJ LOGIC,  Hudson Tent. Further proof that jazz is in a curious period: the recent signing by Blue Note Records of Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, who play long, funky, messy instrumental jams. They'll be performing with the turntablist DJ Logic. Expect slow-boil, get-in-touch-with-yourself music; the fresh air will suit it.</p>
        <p>June 9</p>
        <p>MYRA MELFORD'S SAME RIVER, TWICE,  Main Space, Knitting Factory. It's about time this pianist and composer got a prime festival slot. Eight years since she made her first album, her work keeps improving, with strong melodies and a compulsion toward restless exploration of timbre. This quintet, which includes the trumpeter Dave Douglas and the reed player Chris Speed, is her best group yet.</p>
        <p>June 10</p>
        <p>VU-TET,  the Independent. There are few trumpeters in downtown music who play with as much authority as Cuong Vu. His compositions for this quintet, with their skillfully written sequential episodes through patches of wooliness and calm, are fast gaining pace with his strong tone and improvisational skill.</p>
        <p>June 11</p>
        <p>ABBEY LINCOLN AND TRIO,  Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, STEVE LACY TRIO,  Iridium, 48 West 63d Street. Here's a good chance to catch up on the world outside the festival, at the middle of two weeklong runs. Ms. Lincoln's riveting wail will expunge all false emotion from the Blue Note; an excellent band will help her, including the pianist Marc Cary and drummer Alvester Garnett. Shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M.; admission, $30. Meanwhile, Steve Lacy, still the soprano saxophonist to beat in this world, builds his musical house of cards at Iridium with the bassist Jean-Jacques Avenel and the drummer John Betsch. Neither of these first-rate headliners has emitted a corny note for much of this century's second half. Shows are at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M.; cover, $20 weekdays, $25 weekends; minimum, $10 at all times.</p>
        <p>June 12</p>
        <p>HENRY THREADGILL SOCIETY SITUATION DANCE BAND; BUTCH MORRIS HOLY GHOST,  Hudson Tent. This is a natural double bill. Friends for more than two decades who've often shared sidemen, Mr. Threadgill and Mr. Morris both create a nonindigenous and highly magical world music. Though Mr. Threadgill's intricately structured dirges and Mr. Morris's conducted-but-not-composed happenings might reflect travelers' sensibilities -- Mr. Threadgill lives half the year in India, and Mr. Morris spends much of his time in Berlin, Istanbul and Tokyo -- the music is more about their odd-bird sensibilities and is richer for it. Mr. Threadgill's 19-piece unit and Mr. Morris's 20-piece orchestra are both making New York premieres.</p>
        <p>June 13</p>
        <p>CARAVAN: AN ADVENTURE WITH THE LATIN JAZZ GENIUS OF DUKE ELLINGTON AND JUAN TIZOL,  Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street. Presented by the Duke Ellington Society, this concert is a rare spotlighting of Ellington's trombonist Juan Tizol; of course, it will include ''Caravan,'' but also premieres of Tizol's music found in the Library of Congress. Steve Turre and Britt Woodman play the trombone parts; elsewhere in the band are the pianist Stanley Cowell, the saxophonist Frank Wess and the drummer Victor Lewis. The show is at 9:30 P.M.; tickets, $25.</p>
        <p>June 14</p>
        <p>RAVI SHANKAR; RAVI COLTRANE; ALICE COLTRANE,  Town Hall. This is one of a few cheeky Texaco bookings, where continuity between acts is more literal than musical, established by a name or a word. But it's also a stroke of inspiration. Mr. Coltrane, John Coltrane's son, was named after the sitarist Mr. Shankar, but hadn't met him until a few weeks ago. This may not be the all-jamming-together extravaganza of your dreams -- Alice Coltrane is only slated for a piano-playing cameo during her son's set -- but if the Music of the Spheres is found, all bets are off.</p>
        <p>June 15</p>
        <p>YOUR FEET'S TOO BIG: MUSIC OF FATS WALLER,  Kaye Playhouse. It's hard to think of a composer who inspires better tributes than Waller, because he wrote only a few super-famous songs and because even as a historic figure he's too vigorous to become frozen in myth. Eleven musicians, including the rarely seen pianist Ralph Sutton and the indefatigable Clark Terry, play Waller tunes.</p>
        <p>June 16</p>
        <p>TO HERB ELLIS WITH LOVE,  Kaye Playhouse. Guitarists can get a little  cultish; frequently unrecognized amid all those bright-burning saxophones and trumpets in jazz, they tend to protect their own. This is an evening in appreciation for Oscar Peterson's longtime guitarist, and it gathers some of the best pickers in the world: Tal Farlow, John Abercrombie, Charlie Byrd, Joe Diorio, Andy Summers, Mundell Lowe and 11 others.</p>
        <p>June 17</p>
        <p>BRIAN BLADE FELLOWSHIP; ELVIN JONES JAZZ MACHINE,  Blue Note. Mr. Blade, a splendid young drummer who's involved in a wider array of high-level music than most of his peers (he'll be just back from a West Coast tour with Joni Mitchell), makes a premiere this week with his quintet, which includes two saxophones and a pedal steel guitar. Mr. Jones, Mr. Blade's greatest inspiration, opens the set.</p>
        <p>June 18</p>
        <p>HAROLD ARLEN IN JAZZ,  Kaye Playhouse. ''I don't like highbrows who arch their eyebrows when a jazz tune is played,'' went Jack Yellin's words to an early Arlen song, ''Sweet and Hot.'' No surprise that he'd become one of the jazz standard's best sources, a composer whose elegant songs had so much to do with jazz from the beginning that it's been natural for improvisers to inscribe them. The pianist Barbara Carroll and the singer Carol Sloane headline this tribute; musicians include Clark Terry and Bill Charlap.</p>
        <p>June 19</p>
        <p>JOAO GILBERTO,  Carnegie Hall. Mr. Gilberto, the father of bossa nova, averages a New York concert every 10 years; nearing 70, he's still capable of wrenchingly beautiful performances, his quiet, intriguingly phrased syllables bouncing against strange guitar rhythms. He will perform alone; it will be a chance to experience that rare late-20th-century opportunity, a lasting art form as practiced by its source.</p>
        <p>June 20</p>
        <p>MARIA BETHANIA,  Carnegie Hall.  For 30 years, Ms. Bethania has been a favorite singer in Brazil, a dusky-throated earth mother whom the country has adopted as one of its primary voices. She's playing a well-plotted retrospective program, heard on her recent album, ''Imitacao da Vida,'' full of elegant music by the great songwriters of Brazilian popular music and poetry by the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa.</p>
        <p>June 21</p>
        <p>A TRIBUTE TO CANNONBALL  ADDERLEY,  Schomburg Center for  Research in Black Culture. Really it's a gig by Cannnonball's brother, Nat, who has a longstanding band worth hearing in its own right, with the fire-breathing saxophonist Vincent Herring in the Cannonball role.  The Schomburg's comfortable theater has great sound; this is one of the few festival events where you can count on the right listening conditions.</p>
        <p>June 22</p>
        <p>SAM NEWSOME AND GLOBAL UNITY,  Knitting Factory, Alterknit Theater. Mr. Newsome, a soprano saxophonist, is working on an internationalist, rhythm-based idea of jazz that includes a glowing sense of humor, poetry and sparse swing. His lean band can be a thrill. The show is at 9 P.M.; admission, $7.</p>
        <p>June 23</p>
        <p>CASSANDRA WILSON,  Carnegie Hall. This will be this singer's opportunity to one-up her run of Lincoln Center concerts last winter, and chances are she'll do it. There was no word on the group at press time, but after December's confused concerts,  it would be wise to stick to her usual rhythm-based small group, where her oaky voice attracts more attention. The cornetist Olu Dara opens with his stretched-out-on-the-sofa, purring brand of the blues.</p>
        <p>June 24</p>
        <p>BRAZILIAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE,  Avery Fisher Hall. An assemblage of major talent, and one hopes the result will be more than the sum of the parts: Joao Bosco, the guitarist and composer, who digs into his country's dance-rhythm traditions as well as, more recently, the sounds of Andalusia; the Lebanese-Sicilian-Brazilian guitarist Egberto Gismonti, whose natural internationalism extends to classical music, jazz and pop; Leny Andrade, a jazz-scatting matriarch of Brazilian popular music, and Toninho Horta, an excellent guitarist who helped Milton Nascimento make some marvelous recordings.</p>
        <p>June 25</p>
        <p>DAVE DOUGLAS,  Tonic. John Zorn, the saxophonist, composer and executive producer of two record labels, works quickly. On a recent Thursday, he heard about Tonic, a new 150-foot-long space in a former kosher winery on the Lower East Side, and went to inspect it. On Friday, he got on the telephone. By Monday, he had booked a 40-night series there, from June 24 through Aug. 16. On June 25, the trumpeter Dave Douglas plays in a quick-reflexes duet with the drummer Joey Baron at 9 and 10:30 P.M. Admission is $10.</p>
        <p>June 26</p>
        <p>LOS VAN VAN, CUBANISMO,  Hammerstein Ballroom. Van Van, the headliners of this all-Cuban show, are often called the best dance band in the world; fronted by the bassist Juan Formell, they've been making crowds explode for 30 years. The band Jesus Alemanys Cubanismo is  a throwback to 50 years ago, but no less strong, given its leader's clean and battering tone.</p>
        <p>June 27</p>
        <p>THE LATIN JAZZ JAM,  Carnegie Hall. This brings together some of the last great headliners in Latin music, the singer Celia Cruz and the timbalero Tito Puente. They know how to throw a party.</p>
        <p>June 28</p>
        <p>DEREK BAILEY AND SUSIE IBARRA,  Tonic. Two expert free improvisers, Derek Bailey on guitar and Susie Ibarra on drums, will cruise through their inventions; there will be few repetitions and plenty of imagination. June 28 at 9 and 10:30 P.M. Tickets, $10.</p>
        <p>June 29</p>
        <p>GEORGE GRUNTZ CONCERT JAZZ BAND,  Knitting Factory. This group has always been one of Europe's best big bands, filled with controlled, precise arrangements and a rawness. Its rare shows here are occasions. At 8 P.M.; admission, $8.</p>
        <p>June 30</p>
        <p>URI CAINE,  Knitting Factory. This pianist will play his interpretations of Mahler with a group, reprising a recent album, Primal Light, that has been extremely successful in Europe. It's knotty, intelligent music. At 8 P.M.</p>
        <p>Trombones to Tributes: JVC Jazz Festival Lineup</p>
