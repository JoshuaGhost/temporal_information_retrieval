        <p>The expiration date of the offer is May 28, but it may be extended by SPX, which is based in Muskegon, Mich. SPX is also an auto parts maker.</p>
        <p>Echlin has been fighting the hostile bid since February and has asked shareholders to wait until its board makes a recommendation on the offer. The company said the board would make a recommendation within 10 days.</p>
