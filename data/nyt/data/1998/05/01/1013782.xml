      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Webster L. Hubbell's memoir, published last year, was called ''Friends in High Places.''</p>
        <p>But the help he got from some of his friends in high places, especially the more than $500,000 he earned from clients who were steered to him by influential Clintonites, led to a new indictment that was returned today against Mr. Hubbell, his wife and two financial advisers by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbell's friends included  President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who took him to Washington with them and ensconced him in a top post at the Justice Department. Members of the Clinton inner circle, including the White House adviser Thomas F. McLarty 3d and the Washington lawyers Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Mickey Kantor, helped Mr. Hubbell find clients after he resigned from the Justice Department in the spring of 1994 after a messy billing dispute with his former Arkansas law firm was disclosed. In December 1994, Mr. Hubbell pleaded guilty to tax evasion and to bilking more than $300,000 from his law firm and clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr has displayed a keen interest in the consulting business Mr. Hubbell started after his resignation. Why would some of the United States' best-known companies, including Revlon Inc., hire a disgraced former Government official?</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Starr said Mr. Hubbell ''performed little or no work'' for some of the payments he received from 15 clients, including $62,775 from Revlon and $100,000 from Hong Kong China Limited, a company controlled by the Riady family of Indonesia. Mr. Starr has been investigating whether associates of the President steered business to Mr. Hubbell to buy his silence and hinder Mr. Starr's investigation of the Whitewater land deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbell has denied that the consulting fees were hush money. In testimony before the Senate Whitewater committee, Mr. Hubbell said,  ''I have a wife and four children, and I needed work. There wasn't anything improper with it, and nobody's promised me a damn thing.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton has also said there were no improper motives behind the help his friends gave to Mr. Hubbell.</p>
        <p>''They were people who were genuinely concerned that there was a man who was out of work, who had four children. And as I understand it, they were trying to -- to help him for no other reason than just out of human compassion,'' he said last year.</p>
        <p>The charges brought against Mr. Hubbell's wife, Suzanna, intensify the pressure on Mr. Hubbell. In his book, he repeatedly expressed his love and gratitude to his wife, who has supported the family since his imprisonment and faced rejection by  friends and family members for standing by him.</p>
        <p>Appearing before reporters today outside their home in northwest Washington, the couple vowed to fight the new charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr would still like to know  more from Mr. Hubbell, who was one of the Clintons' closest friends. Besides looking into Mr. Hubbell's consulting work, Mr. Starr has been investigating legal work done by Mrs. Clinton at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Mr. Hubbell was also a senior partner. They both may have done legal work on Castle Grande, one of the land deals Mr. Starr has been scrutinizing. Mrs. Clinton did legal work on some controversial business matters for Seth Ward, Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hubbell was released from prison in 1997, he said that he had already given truthful testimony to Mr. Starr and that he would no longer cooperate. In his statement today, Mr. Hubbell vowed to resist ''any attempt to get me to lie about the President of the United States.''</p>
        <p>The past four years have seen Mr. Hubbell fall from the dizzying heights of power in Washington -- he was one of the most influential officials in the Justice Department -- to a marginal existence. During the first years of the Clinton Administration, Mr. Hubbell, a former college football hero, judge and once-respected lawyer, often traveled back to Arkansas on Air Force One with the President. He often joined Mr. Clinton on the golf course.</p>
        <p>Since his release from a halfway house in February 1997, Mr. Hubbell has worked at a small nonprofit group in Alexandria, Va., where he earns about $900 a month. The group, the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives, helps seek release for elderly and nonviolent prisoners.</p>
        <p>The Hubbells once lived in a grand house in Little Rock. In his book, Mr. Hubbell wrote about his expensive tastes. He said his family's expenses, including private schools for his children and his penchant for the high life, caused him to live beyond his means and skim expense money from his law firm. The new indictment charges that the Hubbells continued their profligate spending, avoiding paying taxes while earning more than $1 million from 1994 to 1997.</p>
        <p>The Hubbells now live with their youngest daughter in a rented townhouse here, their expenses partly subsidized by Mrs. Hubbell's sister. Mrs. Hubbell earns $66,000 as a special assistant at the Interior Department. A spokesman for the department said Mrs. Hubbell could remain in her job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbell has also earned money from book-writing. He commanded a $400,000 advance for ''Friends in High Places,'' although several individuals in the publishing business said the book, published by Morrow, failed to recoup the advance, in part because it had no bombshell revelations about the Clintons.</p>
        <p>Michael Carlisle, Mr. Hubbell's agent, said he had been working with Mr. Hubbell on two new book proposals, and trying to interest movie-makers in ''Friends in High Places.'' But, Mr. Carlisle noted, ''he is so vilified in one corridor it's hard to find someone who's not scared.''</p>
        <p>Today, few of Mr. Hubbell's old friends in high places wanted to talk about him. Michael Cardozo, a Democratic lawyer who helped Mr. Hubbell find office space after his resignation from the Justice Department, said, ''I've never seen or spoken to him since he's been released from prison.''</p>
        <p>In an interview last year, Mr. Hubbell said he understood why he was a pariah, noting that his former friends would risk being subpoenaed  by Mr. Starr if they contacted him.</p>
