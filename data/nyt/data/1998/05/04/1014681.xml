        <p>A year ago, Mark Martin saw his chance to win the inaugural California 500 in Fontana disappear when he had to make a late stop for gas. Yesterday, he had more than enough to put away the rest of the field for his third victory of the season.</p>

        <p>The winner took the lead for the final time on Lap 206, during the final round of green-flag pit stops, and beat the new series points leader, Jeremy Mayfield, to the finish line by 1.287 seconds -- about 15 car lengths.</p>
