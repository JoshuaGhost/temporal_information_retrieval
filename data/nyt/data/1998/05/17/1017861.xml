        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>3-15</p>
        <p>Indonesian Leader Sees Different Reality  President Suharto of Indonesia faces some agonizing choices in responding to the snowballing movement against him. Yet one reason for the turmoil is that the perceptions that frame his decision-making are a world apart from those that invigorate his opponents.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto said he would reshuffle his Cabinet. But analysts said he must make deeper changes if he is to survive in office.</p>

        <p>New Political Stance in India  India's nuclear tests have forced it to reset its political as well as its philosophical compass -- turning a nation that had long preached the gospel of peace into an international pariah.</p>

        <p>Clinton Finds Few Takers  President Clinton kept up his criticism of India for its nuclear tests. But his yearned-for web of constraining international relationships appeared to be no match yet for competition among national interests.</p>

        <p>The leaders of eight major countries, meeting in Britain, turned their attention to other issues, including international crime and helping the world's poorest countries.</p>

        <p>Rights of Patients A Big Election Issue  Public anger over the state of managed care has burst into this year's election campaigns as a major issue, with Democrats and a few Republicans seizing on consumer complaints and calling for a sweeping ''patients' bill of rights.'' The candidates' assault on H.M.O.'s marks a striking shift in public sentiment from the time when the insurance industry and the Republican-controlled Congress beat back the President's sweeping effort to overhaul the health care system.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Microsoft Talks Collapse  Settlement talks between Microsoft and state and Federal justice officials collapsed, apparently after its chairman, William H. Gates, ordered lawyers to withdraw earlier concessions, and Justice Department officials said that they intended to file a sweeping antitrust suit tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Pilots Fighting Age Limit  At a time when Americans are living longer than ever, the Federal Aviation Administration is still forcing airline pilots to retire at age 60. Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will announce whether it will hear the appeal of a group of pilots who say that the regulation violates the Federal law barring age discrimination.</p>

        <p>Jury Gets Bribery Case  A Houston jury has begun deliberations in the Federal trial of a lobbyist and several former and current City Council members, who are accused of bribery and conspiracy in connection with a development project. The defendants say they were victims of entrapment by zealous Government agents.</p>

        <p>Hazardous Sidewalk Fare  Street corner food vendors deliver a sidewalk smorgasbord as varied as the city itself, but with their diverse fare, many vendors are serving up a heightened risk of sickness, according to safety experts, city health records and tests of sidewalk food. Roughly 40 percent of New York's vendors handle foods that can be hazardous, according to city figures.</p>
