        <p>The Brazilian Congress has dealt President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's plans for social security reforms their most significant defeat, rejecting a constitutional amendment earlier this month that would have raised the minimum age for retirement.</p>
        <p>The amendment would have required men to work until they turned 60 and had been employed for 35 years in order to qualify, while women would have to be at least 55 and to have worked for 30 years.</p>
        <p>Labor unions and opposition parties complained that the changes would have penalized unskilled laborers, who tend to enter the work force at younger ages and would therefore be required to work still more years until they reached 60.</p>
        <p>The Cardoso administration contended, however, that the change, a cornerstone of its plan to overhaul Government pensions, would save social security about $100 million a month. Finance Minister Pedro Malan has warned that the system's debt would reach $9 billion this year, up from $1 billion in 1996.</p>
        <p>This week the Government recovered somewhat, after the President publicly attacked early retirees as ''vagabonds'' and personally lobbied Congress. On Wednesday the House approved a transitional retirement age of 53 for men and 48 for women for those already in the social security system. Men would still have to put in 35 years, and women 30, to collect full pensions by those ages.</p>
        <p>While officials are pledging to reassess the minimum age requirements after national elections in October, the unexpected defeat two weeks ago signaled a surprising decline in Congressional support for the President's economic agenda. The day before the vote, a series of Government bills affecting the civil service ranks were largely thrown out.</p>
        <p>The downturn in support came a few weeks after two of Mr. Cardoso's key political allies, Sergio Motta, the 56-year-old Communications Minister, and Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, the Government's 43-year-old deal-maker with Congress, died within 48 hours of each other, one from chronic lung disease and the other from a heart attack.</p>
        <p>''With each day, the reforms become more politically expensive and more unlikely,'' Representative Augusto Carvalho, former leader of the opposition Popular Socialist Party, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Economists and international investors consider the changes necessary to streamline the economy, reduce debt and save the social security system from insolvency.</p>
        <p>But for many voters, the proposed changes mean eliminating job protection and extending the number of years they must work.</p>
        <p>A constitutional amendment on civil service reform has been passed by both houses of Congress, but accompanying laws detailing how the reforms will be carried out have not been passed.</p>
        <p>A social security overhaul has cleared the Senate once, and the President hoped that the lower house would spare it further votes by approving the project in its entirety. As it became clear that blanket approval was unlikely, the Government risked separating the various articles of the bill into individual votes.</p>
        <p>The vote on retirement age fell one short of the 308 needed to approve a constitutional amendment, with 148 votes against and 8 abstentions.</p>
        <p>This week Government officials pledged to reintroduce the minimum age for retirement next year as a law --which requires only a simple majority to pass -- instead of a constitutional amendment.</p>
        <p>While Brazil's Government has made important progress privatizing state mining and electrical companies and establishing a legal framework for the privatization of the oil industry, it has lagged behind on structural changes needed to put the nation's finances in order.</p>
        <p>Election politics is a factor in slowing the pace of change. For the first time, all politicians except mayors are up for re-election this October. Few members of Congress, Mr. Carvalho said, would be willing to risk angering their constituents by voting to cut jobs or increase the retirement age.</p>
        <p>The death of Mr. Magalhaes caught the Government unprepared.</p>
        <p>Official attention has also been consumed by a severe drought in the northeast, affecting 10 million people. Without Government help, people have been surviving on wild muskrats and cactus, and some have taken to looting Government food stocks and supermarkets.</p>
        <p>But under fire from judges, the Roman Catholic Church and the news media -- all of which noted that under Brazilian law, thefts committed out of a ''state of necessity'' are not criminal offenses -- the President seemed to backtrack. He began distributing food stocks and moved up a trip to the drought region.</p>
        <p>Alexandre Barros, an economic consultant here, said that while international investors celebrated the economic opening of the Brazilian market, executives in industries like retailing are beginning to feel a creeping pessimism, uncertain of how the Government's proposed reforms would affect them and fearing that the severest measures and the worst unemployment were yet to come after the elections.</p>
        <p>''I've heard people say, 'I don't care that these guys died. I want to know what's going to happen to my business,' '' Mr. Barros said.</p>
        <p>''What people are feeling is a Government paralysis -- really, for the first time under Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration.''</p>
