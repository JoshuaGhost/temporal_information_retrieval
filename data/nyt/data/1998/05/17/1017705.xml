        <p>MANY an artist worked from sun to sun to construct the exhibition ''A Woman's Work Is Never Done.'' The exhibition, an end-of-the-century assessment of women's roles in American culture, will begin on Wednesday and continue through June 21 at Hudson Square, a sprawling commercial expanse on Hudson Street that was once home to a furniture showroom.</p>
        <p>The project is described as a ''living museum'' by Merry Conway and Noni Pratt, the artists primarily responsible for this show. It is part vaudeville, part installation and inspired by a fun-house or carnival atmosphere. (Ms. Pratt is shown at left performing in one exhibit.)</p>
