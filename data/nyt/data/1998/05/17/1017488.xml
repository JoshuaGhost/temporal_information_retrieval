        <p>Ellen Dudley letter on issues raised in April 26 article on property-tax reform in Vermont to make financing of public schools more equitable from town to town; contends poor have been footing the bill in Vermont for years, and now it is time for rich to pay up</p>

        <p>Mary Barrosse is not, nor will she ever be, a ''Vermonter'' (''Don't Tread on My Tax Rate,'' by Elinor Burkett, April 26). As people here like to say, ''Just because the cat had her kittens in the oven don't make 'em biscuits.'' The vitriol and antagonism coursing through Vermont in the wake of Act 60 has been simmering for a long time and comes, in part, from the influx of those like Barrosse who bring money and yuppie expectations to the state and price the working folk out of their own communities.</p>

        <p>It's pretty hard to hang on to property when real-estate values are jacked up by people who think $200,000 is a modest price for a house and you make $15,000 a year as a clerk. In many ways, the poor have been footing the bill for the rich up here for years, and now it's time for the rich to pay up.</p>
        <p>Act 60 should make things more equitable.</p>
