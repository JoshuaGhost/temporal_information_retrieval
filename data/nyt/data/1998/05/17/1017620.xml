        <p>WITH school districts presenting their proposed 1998-99 budgets to communities on Tuesday, in most places parents, school board members and other supporters of public education have spent the last few days reminding their neighbors to vote.</p>
        <p>Not so in the beleaguered Greenburgh Central 7 School District, where not even all the school board members are in favor of the $36.8 million budget, which would require a projected tax-rate increase of 14.9 percent, although the increase in actual spending for school programs is more modest. The proposed budget was approved by a 5-to-4 school board vote. And unlike recent years, when budgets were defeated by relatively close margins on the second or third attempt, few district residents expect this budget to be approved. Residents will also be asked to vote on three propositions.</p>
        <p>''I feel there is 0 percent possibility that this budget will pass,'' said Doris Stark, a vice president of the P.T.A. Council in Greenburgh Central 7, who has three children attending schools in the district. ''It's a shame, but people feel they are voting against the administration.''</p>
        <p>For some residents, the vote on Tuesday offers an opportunity to express their frustration with the way the district has been managed in recent years. Some parents, who in the past had grudgingly supported the budget, have written letters to the local paper and talked to their neighbors at community events about their decision to vote no. Still others are frustrated that, largely because of changes in state education law, the high tax rate will go into effect despite defeat at the polls. Under those changes, districts whose budgets are rejected twice have to adopt an austerity budget, which includes teaching salaries, supplies, transportation, sports and extracurricular activities and any contract services, like those provided by the Board of Cooperative Educational Services.</p>
        <p>In previous years, the district had been able to use part of its fund balance to offset some expenses. According to the Greenburgh district, other factors have contributed to the high tax rate. Besides the loss of assessments, the district's fund balance that had been used in previous years to help reduce the tax rate is no longer available.</p>
        <p>''For the last four years, the tax-rate increase has averaged 2.5 percent,'' the district's clerk, Liz Weinberg, said. ''It has been so low because the district has had a fund balance, and we could put money into the budget without having to ask taxpayers. We knew the fund balance was coming to an end. This year, there definitely is a high tax-rate increase. Hopefully, after this year, our rates will be closer to other districts. Unfortunately, the community was not willing to support the schools even in years when the rate was lower.''</p>
        <p>For many in the community, the school budget has become a lightning rod for tension and discontent. Proposals to reduce the district's financial support for its early childhood program, as well as discussion to have busing provided by a private company, have prompted protests and demonstrations in front of some school board members' homes and heated debates at budget hearings.</p>
        <p>''The community will respond to increased taxes if it feels that the administration is sensitive to its needs,'' said the Rev. Wilbert Preston, pastor of Christ Temple in Greenburgh. ''But there's frustration that the administration is not sensitive to their needs. The budget is a hot item, and there's a lot of controversy. The community has always said it wants to keep busing as part of the budget. People feel that privatizing the transportation will affect the continuity people have with busing.'' At Tuesday night's meeting, the Greenburgh board voted against hiring a private company for its transportation services.</p>
        <p>Such passions have led to what some residents perceive as a pitched battle between the administration and parents.</p>
        <p>''People are very dissatisfied,'' said Carol DeLucia, a member of the school board who voted against the proposed budget. ''I'm not supporting the budget. There are lots of questions I have about the financials of the district, and the administration has lots of questions to answer. We're being given general information, but where is the money going?</p>
        <p>''This is a referendum against the Superintendent. A lot of the recommendations we were given, I felt, were improper and inaccurate. We find ourselves repeating the same mistakes. Our school district is like a triage system. Wherever the crisis is, that's our management style.'' The superintendent, Dr. Anthony L. Mazzullo, did not return several phone calls.</p>
