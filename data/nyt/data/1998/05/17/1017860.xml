        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reacted furiously yesterday to a union leader's refusal to sign an agreement to avert the layoffs of 900 city hospital workers, saying the leader's obstinacy would cost his members their jobs.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reacted furiously yesterday to a union leader's refusal to sign an agreement to avert the layoffs of 900 city hospital workers, saying the leader's obstinacy would cost his members their jobs.</p>
        <p>''He has a right to do that, and then we have a right to fire his people, which we're going to do -- lay them off,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>The union leader, James H. Butler, said later that he would sign the agreement ''over my dead body'' and acknowledged that layoffs were the likely result.</p>
        <p>''We're at war with Giuliani, and when you're at war, everyone doesn't come back,'' said Mr. Butler, president of Local 420 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</p>
        <p>The Mayor and labor leaders reached an oral agreement two weeks ago to postpone the layoffs for a 30-day ''cooling-off period'' while officials tried to find other city jobs for the workers. Under the agreement, the city agreed to pay the workers' salaries during the 30-day job search.</p>
        <p>But at the time of the agreement, the Mayor was firm that the workers were not needed by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. Mr. Butler insists that the workers are needed in the hospitals and that health care for the poor will suffer without them.</p>
        <p>City officials have said that if Mr. Butler does not back down, layoffs will begin tomorrow for the roughly 650 hospital workers who have not yet been put in other city jobs.</p>
        <p>''If he doesn't agree to what the other unions agreed to,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''then the people represented by Mr. Butler, unlike the others, will be laid off or fired.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler said his members would rally Wednesday afternoon at Harlem Hospital Center, which faces the most layoffs. He said the union also planned protests at City Hall and at Gracie Mansion, the Mayor's residence. Mr. Butler said demonstrators would follow Mr. Giuliani if he made out-of-town speeches to Republican audiences, as he has several times in recent months.</p>
        <p>''Our message will be that the Mayor is not concerned about health care for poor people and uninsured people,'' Mr. Butler said.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said that Mr. Butler had ''done a very bad job of handling this.''</p>
        <p>''For some reason, he doesn't want to live up to the agreement that we made,'' Mr. Giuliani said. He added: ''Unlike the other unions, where people have been redeployed and we've found other jobs for them, his people will have to be laid off and fired because he wants to be obstinate. Maybe he can explain that.''</p>
