        <p>HOUSE playoff money. That's what the Knicks were playing with this weekend, and that's what they lost yesterday to a couple of guys who were practically raised inside Madison Square Garden and another who has the audacity to think of it as home.</p>
        <p>Chris Mullin of Flatbush, Brooklyn, tapped a fatal rebound to the former Knick Mark Jackson of St. Albans, Queens, who rerouted the ball to Reggie Miller, who now, more than ever, believes he owns the expensive real estate in front of Spike Lee's front-row seat.</p>
        <p>''I had the shot but I couldn't take it, seeing as this is Reggie's home court,'' Jackson later joked.</p>
        <p>More to the point, Reggie Miller's resort hideaway, from where he launched 3-point bombs in playoffs past that earned him the reputation as a rooftop terrorist who stalks the Knicks. Miller sure knew where to camp when the Pacers were down to one possession and 19.3 seconds with which to erase a 3-point deficit and set back a Knicks post-season that was suddenly and startlingly beginning to inflate.</p>
        <p>Miller went behind the 3-point line, out on the left wing, one unused bullet left in a gun he had promised to empty in the Pacers' fourth-quarter huddle.</p>
        <p>''We were set up for 3 -- me on the right side, Mark straight out and Reggie to the left,'' Mullin said after the Pacers stole the road game they came for, 118-107 in overtime, in exactly the way New York has grown accustomed to seeing them win.</p>
        <p>Set up for 3, but settling for 2, when Miller was forced to surrender the ball to Rik Smits, who took the ball into the lane. Smits missed, and Patrick Ewing knocked the ball out to where Mullin and John Starks were closest to the ball.</p>
        <p>What we have long known about Mullin and Jackson -- onetime St. John's teammates and Final Four opponents of Ewing at Georgetown -- is that they are children of the playground who never played above the rim but always understood the angles of the game. They are spiritual cousins of their coach, Larry Bird, a man blessed with two of the most penetrating and peripherally trained eyes the sport has seen.</p>
        <p>So, Mullin wisely did not try to grab the ball, inside the 3-point line, with time winding down. He touch-passed it with his right hand, out to Jackson.</p>
        <p>''Of course I'm thinking wide-open 3,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Out of the corner of my eye, I see Mark out there.''</p>
        <p>When Jackson got the ball, he also knew where he'd find Miller, who was waving, yelling ''Hey, hey,'' then clapping his hands.</p>
        <p>Chris Childs -- the polar opposite of Mullin and Jackson; a player who consistently commits himself to the most vulnerable of positions -- was in no man's land. Back foolishly turned to Miller, whom he'd successfully guarded for most of the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Given the choice of scrambling back or pursuing the ball, Childs ran at Jackson.</p>
        <p>Jackson's choice was made easier, though he admitted this wasn't much choice at all.</p>
        <p>''If I'm hot and he's cold, I still would rather him take the shot,'' said one of the last of the pure point guards.</p>
        <p>Jackson delivered the pass. Spike Lee, on his feet behind Miller, frantically trying to direct a misfire, was sadly reminded that like another famous Reggie, Miller often picks the most propitious moments to hit home runs.</p>
        <p>''Off Patrick's hand, off my wrist, off Mark's hip -- nothing but net,'' Mullin said of the play that shocked the Knicks into overtime collapse. ''Just like Larry's commercial.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to those playful hamburger spots Bird used to do with Michael Jordan, in effect mocking the notion that anything of the sort could have possibly been planned. Yes, luck played a role in this most heartbreakingly familiar Knick defeat.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were also offensively inept as the Pacers rallied from 8 points behind in the last five minutes, and Jeff Van Gundy coached as if Ewing's injury never happened, benching his best player, Allan Houston, for 10 fourth-quarter minutes.</p>
        <p>It would be unfair to harp on any of this if the Knicks, as expected, lose a series they trail by 3-1 with Game 5 on Wednesday in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>A month ago, people just hoped they could make the playoffs, win a round. The organization's goals were to generate a few post-season dollars for sweating Garden executives.</p>
        <p>With four games of playoff revenue banked, this was, again, house money they were playing with. Knick supporters can't have it both ways; expectations can't be re-created just because the Knicks were seconds away from sending the Pacers back home in a 2-2 war.</p>
        <p>As Yogi said, and Reggie proves, it ain't over till it's over.</p>
        <p>Not when the opponent brings players who were so much at home in New York's house. Knicks versus Hicks? Mullin and Jackson, who combined for 34 points, 19 assists, 11 rebounds and 6 steals, also distributed roughly 55 tickets for yesterday's game.</p>
        <p>''I had about 50,'' Mullin said.</p>
        <p>''I had about five,'' Jackson said. ''I don't have too many friends.''</p>
        <p>Certainly not after his 3-pointer and lane floater gave the Pacers a 5-point overtime lead, sending Jackson into a timeout sprint toward his bench as he repressed his urge to showboat, to the point where he ''practically had a seizure.''</p>
        <p>The crowd booed.</p>
        <p>Jackson didn't care.</p>
        <p>He and Mullin had made their points, and combined for one classic city-game assist.</p>
        <p>They had what they'd come home for, and weren't planning on coming back.</p>
