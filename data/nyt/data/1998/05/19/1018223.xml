        <p>Fax for Freedom</p>
        <p>DEWI SUKARNO, the third and last official wife of the founding president of Indonesia, wishes she were there. ''I would like to be one of those students on the street, and I would like to shout for freedom,'' Sukarno's 57-year-old widow said from her apartment on the East Side.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mrs. Sukarno went by the numbers. She had faxed a seven-point statement in advance -- No. 1 called for President Suharto's resignation; No. 5 called for Mr. Suharto to permit peaceful demonstrations; No. 6 called for Mr. Suharto to surrender his wealth, ''generated from years of abuse of power,'' and so on.</p>

        <p>Fax for Freedom</p>
        <p>DEWI SUKARNO, the third and last official wife of the founding president of Indonesia, wishes she were there. ''I would like to be one of those students on the street, and I would like to shout for freedom,'' Sukarno's 57-year-old widow said from her apartment on the East Side.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mrs. Sukarno went by the numbers. She had faxed a seven-point statement in advance -- No. 1 called for President Suharto's resignation; No. 5 called for Mr. Suharto to permit peaceful demonstrations; No. 6 called for Mr. Suharto to surrender his wealth, ''generated from years of abuse of power,'' and so on.</p>
        <p>As for No. 1, ''One head of a state should never stay more than one decade.'' Never mind her husband's 22 years. Mrs. Sukarno said 22 years was not too long because ''he was too popular.''</p>
        <p>No. 2 on Mrs. Sukarno's list was elections, ''free elections, not something out of the election machine.'' She said she believed that Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sukarno's daughter and a leading opposition figure, could win. ''Suharto has $50 million and Megawati has nothing,'' Mrs. Sukarno said. ''But she is trusted, and she is clean.''</p>
        <p>Baritones Collide</p>
        <p>For the first time since the invention of the telephone, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is on the cover of the Manhattan Yellow Pages. Yesterday Bell Atlantic's deep-voiced spokesman, JAMES EARL JONES, presented the original illustration to PHILIPPE de MONTEBELLO, the director of the Met and owner of the voice that launched a thousand taped museum tours.</p>
        <p>''I never thought my voice would be reduced to a mouse's squeak,'' he said of appearing with Mr. Jones, ''but the day of reckoning arrives for everyone.'' (Talk about one-way intimidation: Mr. Jones said that Mr. de Montebello has ''a very, very pleasant baritone.'')</p>
        <p>As for the Yellow Pages cover, the 500th by the illustrator MARY LYNN BLASUTTA of New Paltz, N.Y., don't look for it with the Monets.</p>
        <p>''It will go in the museum archives,'' Mr. de Montebello declared.</p>
        <p>Little Tin Box</p>
        <p>There is still a place for the corrupt politician's favorite deposit box. That place was onstage last night at the 92d Street Y, where former Mayor EDWARD I. KOCH sang the unofficial anthem of bribe-seeking officeholders, ''Little Tin Box,'' from the 1959 musical ''Fiorello.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch, who now presides over ''The People's Court'' on television, harmonized, sometimes tunefully, at a tribute to the long-running ''Lyrics and Lyricists'' series at the Y. He appeared with SHELDON HARNICK, who wrote the song's lyrics, and TONY RANDALL.</p>
        <p>''There may be high-tech graft now, but in my day the corrupt ones didn't need a tin box,'' Mr. Koch said. ''They made do with a sock, and they went to jail for it.''</p>
        <p>Soon the performers began comparing their ages with that of the 124-year-old Y -- favorably, since Mr. Koch is 73, Mr. Harnick is 74 and Mr. Randall is 78. ''I'm the ingenue,'' said the mistress of ceremonies, ANGELA LANSBURY. ''I'm a babe of 72.''</p>
        <p>Nuptial Semifinals</p>
        <p>TONY MEREDITH and MELANIE LaPATIN, the dance champions featured in the new Vanessa Williams film ''First Dance,'' were cha-cha-ing as only dance champions can, doing slinky maneuvers with practiced precision. ''Yeah, right, I'll be doing this at my wedding,'' grumbled JENNIFER MEYER, one of 17 prospective brides huddled with their would-be bridegrooms at one end of the Bloom Ballroom, at 48 West 21st Street.</p>
        <p>The idea was to teach the couples to dance at their receptions. But even the box step left stepped-on toes. ''We're hopeless,'' declared Ms. Meyer's fiance, TERENCE NELAN. ''We're going to have to find out if Kenneth Cole makes armored wedding shoes.''</p>
