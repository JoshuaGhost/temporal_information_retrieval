        <p>Lloyd: What Happened</p>
        <p>A Novel of Business.</p>
        <p>By Stanley Bing.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 416 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Crown Publishers. $25.95.</p>
        <p>BACK in 1885, the dean of American letters, William Dean Howells, got very upset with his fellow novelists because of their theatrics. So he published ''The Rise of Silas Lapham,'' a rags-to-riches book about a pretty unexciting guy and his thoroughly ordinary friends. ''Silas Lapham'' is probably the most famous boring novel ever written on these shores.</p>
        <p>Though Stanley Bing, a columnist for Fortune, probably did not set out to write an explicitly dull novel when he conceived ''Lloyd: What Happened,'' the very nature of the project virtually assured that he would end up with a ''Silas Lapham''-like yawner. ''Lloyd,'' described as ''a novel of business,'' is a 416-page account of a year in the life of a senior executive at a large multinational corporation. Frankly, 150 pages would have done the trick.</p>
        <p>Whatever else he may be, Lloyd is not a riveting character. He has a generic job (upwardly mobile executive). He has generic co-workers (go-getters, hotshots, backstabbers, rats). He has a generic family (the kid plays soccer, the missus looks good for 40). He has generic opinions (coffee bars and micro-breweries are annoying). He has a generic affair (with a co-worker, Mona, who has ''perfect'' legs and a ''luscious bottom,'' but when was the last time a femme fatale didn't?). He is not the kind of guy you can build a 416-page novel around. Even Howells brought in ''Silas Lapham'' under 400, figuring anything longer might be pushing it.</p>
        <p>Technically speaking, ''Lloyd'' is a satire, complete with witty graphs and flow charts entitled ''Percent of Lloyd's Bosses Displaying Insane Behavior'' and ''The Battle for Lloyd's Soul.'' This is by far the funniest material in the book. Which is not to say that Bing is incapable of creating a conventionally entertaining scene, as when Lloyd has a cellular-phone conference call while trapped in an elevator. The problem is: he doesn't write that many of them, and when he does, the scenes usually go on for too long.</p>
        <p>Bing is most effective when he is satirizing business-speak, like grown men's inexplicable use of such terms as ''The Rickster'' and ''Que pasarino?'' or when a fired colleague named Ron Lemur wails: ''But this job, this job is my life, Lloyd. It can't be replaced by another job. This is my whole . . . frame of reference.'' Even more inspired is a graph depicting ''Ron's Executive Behavior Since 1990,'' with columns quantifying his capabilities at ''Talking the Talk,'' ''Walking the Walk'' and doing both at the same time. But graphs and charts inserted in a novel are a sleight-of-hand trick, and if you're going to use magic tricks, you'd better use a lot of them, like the young Kurt Vonnegut, and they'd better be really good, like the young Kurt Vonnegut's.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest problem with ''Lloyd'' is the very notion of satirizing the business community. Executives, like rock stars, are a self-satirizing demographic group; it's hard to make them sound more mush-mouthed than they already are. Worse, much of Bing's satire has a moldy aroma. The chart reading ''Things That Corporate Capitalism and Chinese Communism Have in Common,'' which compares Wendy's founder, Dave Thomas, with Lenin, would have been a lot funnier if Spy magazine hadn't already done this kind of stuff in 1987. And if Lenin had been Chinese.</p>
        <p>Similarly, when Bing goes off on a short riff about the middle-aged, middle-class American's aversion to exotic cuisine, he's merely retooling material that Joseph Wambaugh used in ''The Choirboys'' 20 years ago. In the end, ''Lloyd: What Happened'' may try to do in prose what ''Dilbert'' does in pictures. Unfortunately, as is often the case, a picture is worth a thousand words. Especially a thousand of these words.</p>
