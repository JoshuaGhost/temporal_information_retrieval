        <p>DON SNYDER still wants in.</p>
        <p>As president of the Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming Corporation, Mr. Snyder announced in 1996 that his company was set to break ground on a $500 million, 1,000-room, 100,000-square-foot casino hotel in Atlantic City's marina district. Since then, an unending series of legal problems has prevented him from beginning construction on a casino that was to open at the end of this year.</p>
        <p>''One thing that's true in this business: something always happens to change your plans when you say you want to build,'' said Mr. Snyder, who is to speak about the city's future on Thursday at the Rutgers University Gaming Symposium at the Convention Center. ''We've seen that in every market we've gone into.''</p>
        <p>Boyd Gaming owns 11 casinos, two of them on riverboats, in Las Vegas (the Fremont and the Stardust), Louisiana, Illinois and Missouri. It manages a casino on a Choctaw Indian reservation in Mississippi.</p>
        <p>For the last decade -- ''since the regulatory atmosphere improved in New Jersey,'' Mr. Snyder said -- his company has wanted to build a casino on or near the Boardwalk. ''The Atlantic City marketplace happens to sit in a very attractive location near major population centers,'' he said. ''What interests us now hasn't changed from 1996. We still want to be part of the opportunity to redefine that marketplace.''</p>
        <p>This redefinition is the heralded Second Wave, a multi-billion-dollar series of developments that, by this year, was supposed to give Atlantic City enough hotel rooms, entertainment diversity and family-oriented regional tourist attractions to transform a day-tripper's gambling town into a major destination resort city on a par with Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla.</p>
        <p>Some of the Second Wave has washed in: many woefully dilapidated buildings and vacant lots have been replaced by the new convention center, a new bus terminal, a new firehouse, a new public safety building, and improved landscaping along the Missouri and Arkansas Avenue entrance corridor. More hotel rooms, gambling areas, retail and convention space at six casinos have either been completed or are expected to be by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>But the anticipated critical mass has yet to form, largely because of competition from casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut and racetrack slot machines in Delaware, lawsuits involving land acquisition for casino development, and lawsuits seeking to stop the construction of a proposed automobile tunnel that would connect the center of the city to the marina district.</p>
        <p>Stephen A. Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, had specified that he would not break ground on a $2 billion, 7,000-room, three-casino complex on 155 acres of city-owned land there until construction on the tunnel had begun. Mr. Snyder, whose casino was to be one of the three, thought it was prudent to wait. Construction has still not begun.</p>
        <p>In January, citing higher-than-anticipated development costs, Mirage decided to use the entire 155-acre parcel for one vast casino resort and severed its partnership with Boyd Gaming and Circus Circus, which had planned to build the third casino. Those two companies sued Mirage for breach of contract; Mirage countersued. Wall Street gaming industry analysts who had previously trumpeted began to ask if doing business here was worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>Mr. Snyder declined to say how much such troubles have cost Boyd Gaming so far but said, ''We think it's worth whatever it takes to be part of the market.'' Buying and renovating an existing Atlantic City casino ''just isn't worth the cost because everything that's currently in Atlantic City is out of date,'' he said. ''It's all 70's architecture and a way of doing business based on what gaming was like before the Las Vegas Strip redefined the product.</p>
        <p>''What makes Las Vegas so exciting was the way the gaming companies have learned to link their properties together and create that critical mass,'' he said. ''What makes Atlantic City so exciting to us is possibility of redefining the product once again.''</p>
        <p>While his company is still in litigation with Mirage, Mr. Snyder said negotiations were proceeding ''so we expect to be able to build an even bigger and more interesting attraction with Mirage'' and Boyd's 2,000-room, $800 million casino could be open as early as spring 2002.</p>
        <p>''It'll be worth the wait,'' he said.</p>
