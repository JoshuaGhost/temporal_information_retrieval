        <p>When Ed Gibstein started his own investment partnership last year, his golf game suffered. Gibstein, 40, of Locust Valley, N.Y., vowed he would return to his form of 1994, when he reached the quarterfinals of the United States Amateur and the semifinals of the United States Mid-Amateur.</p>

        <p>When Ed Gibstein started his own investment partnership last year, his golf game suffered. Gibstein, 40, of Locust Valley, N.Y., vowed he would return to his form of 1994, when he reached the quarterfinals of the United States Amateur and the semifinals of the United States Mid-Amateur.</p>
        <p>Yesterday in the 50th Richardson Memorial, Gibstein defeated the rising junior Andreas Huber by 7 and 5 in the match-play final at the Seawane Club in Hewlett Bay, N.Y., giving Gibstein his second Richardson title.</p>
        <p>Gibstein, who never trailed in four rounds of match play, eliminated Greg Rohlf by 2 and 1 in the morning semifinal before the easy victory over the 18-year-old Huber, whose mother, the actress Susan Lucci, cheered him on.</p>
        <p>Huber beat Casey Alexander in the other semifinal, 7 and 5, but was admittedly anxious against Gibstein. His double bogey on the par-4 first hole set the tone for a long afternoon under clear skies after a rainy morning.</p>
        <p>''I played really well in every round,'' said Gibstein, who flew to Ireland last night to play in the Irish Amateur.</p>
