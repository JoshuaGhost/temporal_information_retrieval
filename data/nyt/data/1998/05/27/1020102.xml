        <p>South Korea's economic crisis, which seemed to be receding only a few months ago, worsened today with the beginning of a nationwide strike and a deepening weakness in the stock market to an 11-year low.</p>
        <p>The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of South Korea's two umbrella labor organizations, went ahead with a two-day strike to press its demands that the Government take better care of workers whose job security is at risk from the nation's economic problems. As many as 100,000 workers could strike, the union said.</p>

        <p>South Korea's economic crisis, which seemed to be receding only a few months ago, worsened today with the beginning of a nationwide strike and a deepening weakness in the stock market to an 11-year low.</p>
        <p>The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of South Korea's two umbrella labor organizations, went ahead with a two-day strike to press its demands that the Government take better care of workers whose job security is at risk from the nation's economic problems. As many as 100,000 workers could strike, the union said.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the increased tension, South Korea's stock market fell for the third consecutive day. The market's main index dropped 19.91 points, or 6 percent, on Tuesday, to 311.99, the lowest level since February 1987. It was off 9 more points, or 2.9 percent, this afternoon as workers at the Hyundai Motor Company and other plants laid down their tools.</p>
        <p>Spreading worries about labor unrest, the regional effect of the Japanese yen's declining value and a slowdown in the pace of changes requested by the International Monetary Fund have combined to help create the setback in South Korea. ''The financial markets have lost patience with the lack of pace of the restructuring,'' said Dan Harwood, Northeast Asia director of ABN Amro Securities in Seoul.</p>
        <p>A main reason for worker unrest has been the fear of large-scale layoffs. Although no company has undertaken such layoffs, unemployment has risen to 6.7 percent, more than double the average rate last year because of bankruptcies among scores of smaller companies.</p>
        <p>The Japanese yen's slide against the dollar to seven-year lows has raised concerns that South Korean exports will have more difficulty competing with Japanese products.</p>
        <p>Concerns about the high levels of corporate debt and its effect on the banking system are also growing.</p>
        <p>Yet South Korean banks keep lending to strapped companies, and the Government has waffled in its commitment to stop them. Last Thursday, banks extended an additional $416 million in emergency loans, also known as ''cooperative financing,'' to the Dong Ah group, South Korea's 10th-largest conglomerate.</p>
        <p>The renewed sense of uncertainty in South Korea has also hurt the investor appetite for the country's bonds, which have fallen in price.</p>
        <p>The South Korean Government was able to float $4 billion worth of new bonds in early April, a reflection of investor optimism about the nation's prospects after it successfully repackaged about $22 billion in short-term loans owed to foreign banks.</p>
        <p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, one of the lead underwriters on the bonds, was unable to provide information on how the bonds are performing.</p>
