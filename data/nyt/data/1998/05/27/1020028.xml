        <p>BRIDAL gifts usually have a certain durability, even permanance: the Limoges, the Waterford, the Calphalon. They're important, expensive. But, hey, these are the 1990's, and marriages aren't what they used to be.</p>

        <p>BRIDAL gifts usually have a certain durability, even permanance: the Limoges, the Waterford, the Calphalon. They're important, expensive. But, hey, these are the 1990's, and marriages aren't what they used to be.</p>
        <p>And apparently neither are some wedding presents.</p>
        <p>Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the best fancy-food shops in the country, has a new bridal registry. Couples who prefer to stock the pantry instead of the china cabinet can register for extra virgin olive oils (a matched set of five costs $150), rare German vinegars ($100 to $145 a bottle), pasta and sauces (one set is $48), or a collection of basic items, including sea salt, peppercorns, Spanish paprika and Mexican hot chocolate ($50 to $220). The bridal registry is also available through the Zingerman's catalogue, which can be sent to wedding guests for consideration. Information: (888) 636-8162.</p>
        <p>Recently, a couple from Seattle registered for a grab bag of nonperishables: oil, vinegar, honey, salt and pasta sauce. No, gifts like this do not last as long as a silver bowl from Aunt Tillie, but maybe it's just as nice to have some great olives to put in the bowl.</p>
