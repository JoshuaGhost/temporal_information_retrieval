        <p>Following are the text of a letter from Thomas B. Ross, vice president of Government Relations at Loral Space and Communications, to Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, and the text of a memorandum for the President prepared by Mr. Berger; Larry Stein, the White House Congressional liaison, and Daniel K. Tarullo, then assistant to the President for international economic policy. The memorandum, which was declassified on Thursday, was dated Feb. 12 and dealt with a Presidential national-interest waiver for the Chinasat 8 communications satellite project by Loral. The letter from Mr. Ross was dated Feb. 13.</p>
        <p>FROM THE MEMORANDUM</p>
        <p>Purpose</p>
        <p>To decide whether to waive Tiananmen sanctions to permit the licensing of communications satellites and related technology and equipment for export to China by Space Systems/Loral.</p>

        <p>Following are the text of a letter from Thomas B. Ross, vice president of Government Relations at Loral Space and Communications, to Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, and the text of a memorandum for the President prepared by Mr. Berger; Larry Stein, the White House Congressional liaison, and Daniel K. Tarullo, then assistant to the President for international economic policy. The memorandum, which was declassified on Thursday, was dated Feb. 12 and dealt with a Presidential national-interest waiver for the Chinasat 8 communications satellite project by Loral. The letter from Mr. Ross was dated Feb. 13.</p>
        <p>FROM THE MEMORANDUM</p>
        <p>Purpose</p>
        <p>To decide whether to waive Tiananmen sanctions to permit the licensing of communications satellites and related technology and equipment for export to China by Space Systems/Loral.</p>
        <p>Background</p>
        <p>The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1990 and 1991, passed in the wake of the events of Tiananmen Square, suspended the licensing of exports of certain items to China, including defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List and U.S.-origin commercial satellites for launch on Chinese vehicles. These suspensions can be waived if the President reports to Congress that it is in the national interest to do so.</p>
        <p>The Department of State, with the concurrence of the Department of Defense and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, recommends that you waive the legislative restriction on the export to China of the communications satellites and related equipment for the Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) Chinasat 8 project, worth approximately $60-65 million in U.S. content. Since 1993, you have issued 11 such waivers for U.S.-China commercial space projects, which have benefited several U.S. companies, including Loral, Iridium and Hughes, and supported our broader engagement strategy with China.</p>
        <p>In this particular instance, however, the Criminal Division of the Justice Department has cautioned that a national-interest waiver in this case could have a significant adverse impact on any prosecution that might take place, based on a pending investigation of export violations by SS/L. Justice is investigating SS/L's unauthorized transfer of defense services to the Chinese during their joint inquiry into an explosion of a Chinese launch rocket carrying an SS/L satellite in 1996 -- a transfer that could have contributed to the Chinese ballistic missile program. SS/L acknowledges that an unauthorized transfer of technical information took place, but Justice has not decided whether it will take criminal action against SS/L. Justice believes that a jury would not convict once it learned that the President had found SS/L's Chinasat 8 project to be in the national interest. We will take the firm position that this waiver does not exonerate or in any way prejudge SS/L with respect to its prior unauthorized transfers to China. Nevertheless, if Justice's is correct on this matter, the proposed waiver might be criticized for letting SS/L off the hook on criminal charges for its unauthorized assistance to China's ballistic missile program.</p>
        <p>In any case, we believe that the advantages of this project outweigh this risk and that we can effectively rebut criticism of the waiver. On fairness grounds, we believe it is inappropriate to penalize SS/L before they have even been charged with any crime, especially since we have had no problems with two subsequent launches of Loral satellites. In addition, the investigation deals with a transfer which took place in connection with a launch failure, an unusual occurrence, and we have since clarified for all U.S. satellite companies their obligation to obtain a separate U.S. Government license for any discussions related to a Chinese launch failure.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the project is in the national interest because the development of China's civil communications infrastructure will promote access by Chinese citizens in remote areas to people and ideas in democratic societies. As noted below, we have routinely approved similar national-interest waivers for satellite projects using this justification and noting that the projects assist U.S. exporters. The current project also will help maintain the competitiveness of U.S. satellite exporters in a most important satellite market.</p>
        <p>We could respond to criticisms of the proposed waiver on the following grounds:</p>
        <p>*The Chinasat 8 project involves civilian comsat technology and will not contribute to Chinese military capabilities.</p>
        <p>*There were no problems with unauthorized transfers of defense services in connection with two subsequent Chinese launches of Loral satellites, and State and Defense are satisfied that the technology assistance agreement proposed for Chinasat 8 will guard against unauthorized transfers in this project.</p>
        <p>*The investigation of SS/L's unauthorized transfers is at an early stage (not yet before the grand jury, much less subject to an indictment); SS/L is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.</p>
        <p>*If the investigation indicates that SS/L knowingly engaged in unauthorized transfers of defense services, State can impose administrative penalties (debarment and fines) even if Justice concludes that criminal prosecution would be futile.</p>
        <p>*If the evidence leads to such a conclusion before the Chinasat 8 project is completed, the project could be blocked by withholding or withdrawing the necessary export licenses.</p>
        <p>On balance, we believe that these factors support a national-interest waiver for this satellite project. As with earlier waivers, we may be criticized by some members of Congress who are concerned about China's human rights and proliferation record. In that event, we are prepared to provide briefings that explain our reasons for approving the project.</p>
        <p>Recommendation</p>
        <p>That you approve the waiver and sign the letters at Tab A reporting to Congress that it is in the national interest to permit the licensing of communications satellites and related equipment for export to China in connection with the Chinasat 8 project.</p>
        <p>Approve [Backward check mark was marked here]</p>
        <p>Disapprove [Nothing marked]</p>
        <p>TEXT OF LETTER</p>
        <p>I recognize that you are bearing more than the usual load of responsibilities at this time, and I would not be raising this issue if it were not time urgent for us.</p>
        <p>We are told that the request for a waiver to permit Loral to use the China Long March rocket for a satellite launch is in the West Wing, perhaps on the President's desk. If a decision is not forthcoming in the next day or so, we stand to lose the contract. In fact, even if the decision is favorable, we will lose substantial amounts of money with each passing day.</p>
        <p>Bernard Schwartz had intended to raise this issue with you at the Blair dinner, but missed you in the crowd. In any event, we would greatly appreciate your help in getting prompt decision for us.</p>
