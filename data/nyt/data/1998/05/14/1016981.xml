        <p>Decisions. Decisions. Decisions.</p>
        <p>That is what a new children's computer game is asking its players to make. My City, an interactive CD-ROM game, looks like a cross between ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' and Sim City. It is for children 9 to 14 years old who are thrust into the seat of power as mayors of cities that are literally of their own making.</p>
        <p>Unlike other virtual you-build-'em games, My City is less concerned with building skyscrapers, highways and ramparts than with building consensus and citizenship. The point, said the game's developer, Gary Schwartz, is to ''respond as a community and to take responsible action.''</p>
        <p>Players are faced with such decisions as whether to build clinics or parks or recreation centers.</p>
        <p>In one scenario, players might have to bite the bullet when faced with the prospect of gang violence in this metropolis of megabytes. What to do? Arrest more juveniles? Institute curfews? Begin urban renewal projects?</p>
        <p>To be sure, players hear about the consequences of their decisions through in-game media reports and faxes. The game, designed for home and school use, is based on the principles of Unicef's Convention on the Rights of the Child, Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
        <p>''We are not saying that one solution is better than another,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''There are different solutions to every problem,'' he said, ''and certain solutions are short term, long term and expensive.''</p>
        <p>The award-winning game, from McGraw-Hill Ryerson, costs $35.50 and is sold only by mail order at (800) 334-7344. More information about My City (www.unicef-kids.org/mycity/CD.htm) is available on the Web.</p>
