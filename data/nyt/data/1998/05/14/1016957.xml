        <p>Judge Richard P. Matsch of Federal District Court said today that he would order Terry L. Nichols to pay $14.5 million in restitution for conspiring to bomb the Federal Building in Oklahoma City and set June 4 as Mr. Nichols's sentencing date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nichols, who was convicted of conspiracy and manslaughter in the 1995 bombing that killed 168 people, has assets of $20,000 to $40,000, prosecutors said. In addition, they contended today, Mr. Nichols could sell his story for millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nichols has said in an affidavit that he would give any future profit he gained from such an endeavor to the victims of the bombing. Today his lawyer, Michael Tigar, said Mr. Nichols was willing to sign a binding contract to that effect.</p>
        <p>Instead, Judge Matsch said that as part of the sentence he would order that restitution be paid to the General Services Administration, which owned the building, built at a cost of $14.5 million.</p>
