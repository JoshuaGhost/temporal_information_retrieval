        <p>SHAFFER-Bea. Died, as she lived, peacefully and at peace, at ninetythree, on May 1, 1998 in West Palm Beach where she &amp; her late and beloved husband, Joe, had lived happily since 1969. Daughter of the late Sarah and Paul Leibowitz, sister of the late Ruth White, she took great joy and pride in her sons, Jerry and Larry, grandchildren, Diana, David, Greg, Adam, and Deena, and in her greatgrandchildren, Rebecca, Megan and Mellissa. She was loved, admired, and an inspiration to all. Who will worry about us now?</p>
