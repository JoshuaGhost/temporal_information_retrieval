        <p>Best Paroled Man</p>
        <p>ROBERT DOWNEY JR. was the best man at his father's wedding to ROSEMARY ROGERS, a music producer and writer, on Friday in Manhattan. The 33-year-old actor, who was nominated for an Academy Award for ''Chaplin'' in 1992, has been living at a halfway house in California since his release from prison earlier this year. He was jailed in December for a parole violation stemming from a 1996 drug conviction.</p>
        <p>''There are a variety of circumstances'' under which Mr. Downey could travel, said his spokesman, ALAN NEIROB. ''He went in overnight with a representative of his halfway house. He was allowed to do that. He needed permission from the halfway house, and they said, 'You can go if one of us goes with you.' He said, 'Great, like I have a choice.' ''</p>

        <p>Best Paroled Man</p>
        <p>ROBERT DOWNEY JR. was the best man at his father's wedding to ROSEMARY ROGERS, a music producer and writer, on Friday in Manhattan. The 33-year-old actor, who was nominated for an Academy Award for ''Chaplin'' in 1992, has been living at a halfway house in California since his release from prison earlier this year. He was jailed in December for a parole violation stemming from a 1996 drug conviction.</p>
        <p>''There are a variety of circumstances'' under which Mr. Downey could travel, said his spokesman, ALAN NEIROB. ''He went in overnight with a representative of his halfway house. He was allowed to do that. He needed permission from the halfway house, and they said, 'You can go if one of us goes with you.' He said, 'Great, like I have a choice.' ''</p>
        <p>Back to the wedding. How does it feel to a teen-age girl to suddenly be related to Robert Downey Jr.? ''It would seem cooler if it was happening to a friend of mine,'' Ms. Rogers's daughter, NELL MICHLIN, said. ''Then I wouldn't have the nerve-racking part.''</p>
        <p>Another Louis</p>
        <p>LOUIS STRAVINSKY, Igor Stravinsky's 10-year-old great-grandson, tried out WYNTON MARSALIS'S trumpet backstage at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Blow me a high C,' and Louis did, and then did him a scale,'' Louis's father, JOHN STRAVINSKY, said. ''I'd seen Marsalis on 'Sesame Street' with kids, and I'd almost fantasized that moment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsalis had performed Igor Stravinsky's ''Histoire du Soldat'' and a companion piece of his own, ''A Fiddler's Tale.'' Louis played ''Andantino,'' a piano piece by Igor Stravinsky that Louis had transcribed for trumpet.</p>
        <p>''He made a comment about how this horn is better than his,'' John Stravinsky said. ''He's got a rental, which is what people suggest, that you have an instrumental until the kid picks up on it. But he actually practices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsalis's verdict on Louis Stravinsky? ''A born trumpet player with a great embouchure.'' That means good lips.</p>
        <p>A Drinker's Dream</p>
        <p>TREVOR O'DRISCOLL, a Manhattan paralegal, threw darts, poured a drink, gave a speech -- and won a $330,000 pub in Ireland. ''On no sleep,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was declared the winner in Guinness's annual pub giveaway, defeating nine other finalists chosen from 65,000 people who submitted ''Why I like Guinness'' essays. Mr. O'Driscoll, who graduated from Brown University last year and has been working at the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison, plans to move into the four-bedroom publican's house in Listowel, in County Kerry.</p>
        <p>''There's an older couple that Guinness bought the pub from because they're retiring,'' he said by telephone from Listowel. ''They're just moving down the road, and the staff is starting to come up to me and put a good word in for themselves. The truth is, I don't know the first thing about it.''</p>
        <p>Politics to Podium</p>
        <p>FRAN REITER, a former Deputy Mayor and the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, has the conducting bug. On Friday, she directed the New York Pops in the overture to ''Gypsy,'' by JULE STYNE.</p>
        <p>''Schuyler Chapin said to me once that conducting is the last great exercise in fascism,'' Ms. Reiter said, referring to the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner. ''I don't know what he was trying to tell me.''</p>
        <p>And the performance? ''We got a great ovation and no complaints,'' she said. ''The orchestra was great, as they always are. My teacher tells me Rachmaninoff is next.''</p>
