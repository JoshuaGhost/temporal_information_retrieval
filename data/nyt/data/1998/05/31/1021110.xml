        <p>BROADWAY at the corner of Prince Street in SoHo is a boundary between two fashion camps. West lies the familiar, the highly advertised. The khakis of the Banana Republic. The sexy, flower-bedecked extravaganzas masquerading as shoes at D.&amp; G. But east, along Elizabeth, Mulberry and Mott Streets, lies the unknown, the never-advertised, the freshly sprouted -- 25 tiny shops full of clothes, hats, shoes or jewelry. Most have opened in the last two years -- nine last year and five this year -- and two are so new they have just celebrated their one-month anniversaries.</p>
        <p>The shops on these blocks, in a neighborhood known by some as NoLIta (north of Little Italy), which is bounded by Houston Street on the north and Spring Street on the south, offer clothes that are as original as they are reasonably priced. (An average top price is $200.)</p>

        <p>BROADWAY at the corner of Prince Street in SoHo is a boundary between two fashion camps. West lies the familiar, the highly advertised. The khakis of the Banana Republic. The sexy, flower-bedecked extravaganzas masquerading as shoes at D.&amp; G. But east, along Elizabeth, Mulberry and Mott Streets, lies the unknown, the never-advertised, the freshly sprouted -- 25 tiny shops full of clothes, hats, shoes or jewelry. Most have opened in the last two years -- nine last year and five this year -- and two are so new they have just celebrated their one-month anniversaries.</p>
        <p>The shops on these blocks, in a neighborhood known by some as NoLIta (north of Little Italy), which is bounded by Houston Street on the north and Spring Street on the south, offer clothes that are as original as they are reasonably priced. (An average top price is $200.)</p>
        <p>Wearmart, at 229 Elizabeth Street, is so small that one of the owners, Martin Keehn, the shop's designer, said, ''It's 350 square feet on a good day -- when I dust.''</p>
        <p>The shop, which sells medical orderlies' shirts in blue or tan ($48), and a print shirt inspired by a hospital gown ($58), may be minuscule, but Kal Ruttenstein, the senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, stopped in a month ago. ''I love that store,'' Mr. Ruttenstein said. ''Simple shapes and a few silhouettes. We're shopping the line, and next week we plan to meet with the people. I was there on a Sunday and people were there from Jersey who do not think Barneys and Bloomingdale's are trendy enough.''</p>
        <p>Downtown designer storefronts are a required stop for him. ''We found Daryl K that way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For those who wish to look quirky, even when they're just bicycling around to buy dog food and toothpaste, consider this: at Resurrection Vintage Clothing, at 217 Mott Street, Katy Rodriguez, a co-owner, is offering 1960's Pucci girdles in geometric prints of lavender, pink and gray ($125) as biking pants. And at About Time, at 15 Prince Street, the owner, Beverly Wilburn, has a dressmaker who will custom-make a silk chiffon slip dress ($140) with a matching silk under-slip ($75) in one week. ''From Sunday to Sunday,'' Ms. Wilburn said.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood has yet another allure: in contrast to tourist-clogged SoHo, these blocks possess an unhurried ''small town in the big city'' feeling. The area was farmland in the 18th century and was first developed in the 19th century by merchant princes. Then came waves of immigrants, first Irish, then Italian and more recently, Puerto Rican, Dominican and Asians. In these tiny storefronts, customers rediscover that the act of buying and selling can be a friendly, cozy moment. The sales clerk is often the designer.</p>
        <p>In this fashion oasis, designers rent spaces of 300 to 400 square feet for $30 to $50 a square foot (as opposed to $100 or more a square foot in SoHo), create their own simple interiors -- usually concrete floors and white walls with a contrasting ceiling or a wall painted robin's-egg blue, ocher or dusky lavender -- and learn swiftly which clothes sell, which don't and why.</p>
        <p>Amanda Uprichard, the owner and designer of Living Doll, at 49 Prince Street, put stretchy tube tops in two fabrics in her shop. The red-and-white-stripe top ''blew out of the store'' she said. But a shiny black one sat on the racks collecting dust. ''Maybe the fabric isn't interesting?'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Uprichard, who has been a downtown designer since the 1980's, originally selling in the East Village, said that NoLIta has flourished as an alternative fashion mecca because of all the moneyed shoppers drawn to the greater SoHo district. Another factor has been customers' hunger for clothing that is not mass marketed. ''That whole brand consciousness has been so overplayed,'' Ms. Uprichard said, ''that people like to find little unknown pieces and put them together.''</p>
        <p>Tiny boutiques are sweet showcases for the ego. If they didn't exist, people like Mr. Ruttenstein of Bloomingdale's might never see the newest looks. ''Sometimes you need to see them separately displayed to appreciate them,'' he said. ''If mixed in our store, you might lose it.''</p>
        <p>Uptown, fashion executives survey the NoLIta designers with delight. ''What I see downtown is them setting trends, an innocent trend, a naivete, whether it's the hand embroidery or the more artisan type of merchandise,'' said Bonnie Pressman, the executive vice president for women's wear at Barneys New York. ''The little stores give the designers exposure, and keep them in touch with the customer, one on one. If a designer has her own store, it can only benefit the both of us. We'll capture certain customers uptown, and they'll capture customers downtown.''</p>
        <p>But for one of these designers to capture a customer of, say, Bergdorf Goodman is not so simple as just selling to that store. There is a grooming process, a series of intricate lessons in What the Uptown Customer Wants, as interpreted by the uptown store. At Do Kham, a Tibetan store at 51 Prince Street that sells fox-trimmed brocade hats, Pelgye Kelden, the owner, had to revamp a hat to sell it to Bergdorf's. What sold downtown for $275 to $350 and uptown at Bergdorf's for $595 last winter was not the same hat.</p>
        <p>''The uptown hat was better,'' Mr. Kelden said. ''The uptown hat had a silk lining, the downtown one cotton. The uptown hat had denser, thicker, shinier fox.''</p>
        <p>Some NoLIta designers go even further in fine-tuning their designs for individual customers. They will make a ring, hat or dress to order. Kelly Christy, a hat designer at 235 Elizabeth Street, sells confections of hats, some custom-made, from her own shop, as well as through Barneys New York. One hat is literally named for a cake. Called Black Forest, it is a black velvet disk of a cocktail hat trimmed with a black silk button and a black veil and lined in white silk printed with red cherries. (Black Forest cake, classically, is chocolate layered with whipped cream and cherries.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Christy, who gives a 10 percent discount on her hats to people who live in the neighborhood, is usually either in the shop or outside it chatting with friends and sipping coffee. To her, a hat is not frippery but a source of happiness. ''I need to know that my hat makes you feel good,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Karen Karch, a jewelry designer, whose shop, Push, is at 240 Mulberry Street, said she also gets a thrill when a customer asks for a one-of-a-kind design. Take her your grandmother's diamond and a garnet or two, and in four to six weeks Ms. Karch will create a special design, usually inspired by delicate 19th-century estate jewelry.</p>
        <p>Even a lush cashmere sweater can be made to measure. Lucien Pellat-Finet, at 226 Elizabeth Street, is an anomaly in the neighborhood. The store's clothes are only for the very well-heeled, the woman who thinks nothing of buying a cashmere camisole for $700 or a custom-made V-neck four-ply cashmere sweater, like the one Madonna wore on the cover of the March issue of Vanity Fair, for $1,328.</p>
        <p>If most NoLIta designers pride themselves on knowing the exact measurement of a customer's little finger, waist or head, those at Hotel of the Rising Star, which opened in January at 13 Prince Street, maintain that they do not. The designers, who make hooded jackets and sweatshirts, many in the favorite downtown color, black, say they prefer to remain detached and anonymous. But they are not above using their anonymity, like Greta Garbo, to gain attention. When a visitor asked for the designers' names, Anna Gonzalez, who described herself as a stylist, said, ''Orfi.''</p>
        <p>Orfi?</p>
        <p>''Organization for Returning Fashion Interest,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>And who's in the organization?</p>
        <p>''Architects and stylists,'' she said, ''who want to remain anonymous.''</p>
        <p>But if Don Hearn, a designer and member of the so-called Orfi, wanted to remain anonymous, why was he selling clothes in a friendly fashion, identifying himself to a reporter and describing Orfi's manifesto?</p>
        <p>''We are less than 10 and more than 5,'' Mr. Hearn said. ''We're all less than 40 years old, we don't have a marketing plan and we operate like a disease,'' he added. ''Someone has an idea, and it infects someone else, and we make a pattern.''</p>
        <p>No one ever said that one had to to be able to sew to call oneself a fashion designer, and at four stores, at least, none of the owners and designers can sew. But that has not stopped them. The only necessities are ideas, money, a pattern maker and a seamstress.</p>
        <p>BEVERLY WILBURN, once a buyer at Barneys, always wanted to design her own collection, but it wasn't until this year, at 53, that she finally realized her fantasies and hired a dressmaker. Her shop, About Time, sells her made-to-measure silk chiffon dresses ($140), silk chiffon shirts that tie in front ($75) and wispy silk skirts ($85). In a grandmother's peach-colored silk underpants, Ms. Wilburn saw a miniskirt. It was simply a matter of opening up the panties, and what was dreary suddenly became sexy.</p>
        <p>When a teen-age girl and her mother went into the shop looking for a prom dress and rejected Ms. Wilburn's offerings, the designer happily recommended alternatives. ''Try these designers -- Max Azria at BCBG, Rebecca Danenberg and Betsey Johnson,'' she said. And she wrote down the names and addresses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilburn is not alone in her readiness to provide referrals. Corey Pak, the owner of Pak, at 220 Mott Street, sought advice on where to buy rolling gates for her store from Jennifer Wang, who operates Wang at 219 Mott Street with Sally Wang, her sister. Kari Sigerson, a co-owner of Sigerson-Morrison, a shoe store at 242 Mott Street, will sell a customer a pair of shoes. ''And if the customer says she needs a skirt, Kari might send her here,'' Jennifer Wang said.</p>
        <p>The Wang sisters, who grew up in Los Angeles, started designing clothes in 1995, when they found themselves in China with nothing to wear. They were at Beijing University studying Chinese language and art. Last year, they opened their 600-square-foot shop, where they sell clean-cut, simple clothes like flat-front gray wool pants ($165) and a slightly fitted, all-purpose black cotton-spandex jacket ($250).</p>
        <p>Another non-sewer is Mona Arain, who was born in India and whose shop, Scarlet &amp; Sage, is at 7 Prince Street. When she opened in 1996, she sold only home furnishings like turn-of-the-century Turkish perfume bottles trimmed with silver filigree. But with every bottle she sold, she was nursing a desire to make clothes. In January, she introduced a tiny group of updated Indian classics like a coral sleeveless silk dress lined in tussah silk, which buttons down to the waist and then swings open. A sybaritic scarf is pashmina on one side and silk charmeuse on the other ($225).</p>
        <p>Only in the tiny world of NoLIta, and specifically in her 300-square-foot shop, which she rents for $1,500 a month, could Ms. Arain have transformed herself from retailer to designer. ''Is it fate?'' she said. ''I couldn't do this in SoHo, or on Madison Avenue, because I can't afford it.''</p>
        <p>Even as the fledgling designers revel in their shops, they also recognize that the gentrification they are a part of raises rents. ''I've lived in this neighborhood for 12 years,'' said Kelly Christy, the hat designer. ''The change is good for business, but it's no longer off the beaten path. I have a five-year lease on my shop. It was $1,375, and now I pay $1,450, and by the end of the fifth year, it'll be $1,700. And then who knows? It's a fear of mine that we are the pioneers and will drive ourselves out of the neighborhood.''</p>
