        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>By focusing on short-term story lines rather than our long-term growth strategy, your April 20 Business Day article fails to offer an accurate picture of the situation at Universal Studios. We acquired MCA Inc. -- now called Universal Studios -- at a time when the studio's momentum had stalled, back-office inefficiencies were costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars a year and an outdated infrastructure was threatening to undermine its ability to compete with other major Hollywood studios. In our three-year campaign to bring Universal into the 21st century, we eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars in cost redundancies, revamped management and introduced new creative initiatives.</p>

        <p>By focusing on short-term story lines rather than our long-term growth strategy, your April 20 Business Day article fails to offer an accurate picture of the situation at Universal Studios.

        <p>Where others see turmoil and chaos, we see a far different reality. Although we haven't experienced a hit movie this year, we have enjoyed success in every other facet of Universal's operations. The numbers for the first half of the 1998 fiscal year show that we're on track to achieve 20 percent annual growth through the year 2000. That growth pattern would bring Universal's total cash flow to $1 billion as we enter the millennium. If that's chaos, I'll take it any day of the week.</p>
