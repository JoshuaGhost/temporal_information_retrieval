        <p>Many economists assumed, just a few months ago, that the sharp currency devaluations rippling across Asia would sap China's fast-growing exports and foreign investment. Buyers and investors alike, it was widely argued, would turn from China and toward neighboring countries where, for buyers with stronger currencies, prices fell overnight.</p>
        <p>Yet, defying these forecasts, China has reported that exports and foreign investment grew handsomely in the first three months of this year.</p>
        <p>Chinese authorities announced over the weekend that foreign investment grew 9.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a corresponding period in 1997, reaching $8.6 billion. Exports climbed 13.2 percent, according to official figures, reaching $40.1 billion.</p>
        <p>A key reason for the export growth is availability of financing in China and lack of it elsewhere. Southeast Asian nations that devalued their currencies may have expected to reap quick gains in export growth, but economists say that many exporters in those countries have been unable to obtain financing to pay for raw materials, let alone bigger orders.</p>
        <p>Also, some overseas buyers, aware of possible supply problems, have been reluctant to switch orders to Southeast Asian suppliers. Furthermore, Chinese banks have authorized greater lending to Chinese exporters, to help keep exports from falling off.</p>
        <p>Several economists said the new figures bode well for China's ability to resist pressure to devalue its currency, the yuan, and might also help stabilize China's economy, which still looks vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Xu Xiaonian, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said he was most surprised by a 10 percent growth in new contracts for foreign investment.</p>
        <p>''Despite the massive devaluations in neighboring countries, China is still a favored spot for foreign investment,'' Mr. Xu said. ''We expected falling currencies to make other countries more competitive, but their chaotic economic and political situations make China look relatively stable.''</p>
        <p>China's economy grew 7.2 percent in the first quarter, falling below the target of 8 percent. Although robust by international standards, that rate seems slow in China after years of double-digit economic growth.</p>
        <p>Government officials have voiced concern that if the economy slowed further, it could cause social disorder. The change from a planned economy to a market system has already thrown tens of millions of urban workers out of work, and threatens to affect more this year.</p>
        <p>To avoid such a slowdown, China's leaders have pledged to spend $750 billion to $1 trillion on a vast program of public works projects over the next three years, though some economists have expressed doubt that so much will actually be spent.</p>
        <p>Zhang Shangtang, vice chairman of the International Investment Research Center in Beijing, predicted that the spending plan would push overall economic growth to at least 8 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Yet China's economic planners are still hungry for foreign investment as well, Mr. Zhang told China Business Weekly. As a result, the authorities plan to speed the approval process for foreign investment projects, and to resume tariff and tax exemptions dropped two years ago.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, China's exports to other Asian nations fell, while sales to Europe grew 35 percent compared with a corresponding period in 1997, and sales to the United States climbed 14 percent. During the first quarter, exports to Japan fell by 8.5 percent.</p>
        <p>''So far the consequences of the financial crisis on exports and foreign direct investment have not been  perceived,'' Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank vice president for East Asian and the Pacific region, told a recent conference in Beijing.</p>
        <p>''But one has to be very cautious, and that's why if the Government wants to achieve its 8.0 percent growth target this year, it's very wise to boost the economy.''</p>
        <p>Assessing China's overall economic outlook, Mr. Xu said he was most concerned about falling demand among the nation's consumers, and that it might be making exports look better than they would otherwise.  ''As a rule of thumb,'' he said, ''when domestic demand is weak, the external sector tends to perform better, because producers try everything they can to sell overseas.</p>
        <p>''Over all, it's a mixed picture,'' Mr. Xu added. ''Hitting the target of 8 percent growth is potentially achievable, but the leadership has to act on their stimulus package, and they have to act quick.''</p>
