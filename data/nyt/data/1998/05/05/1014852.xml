        <p>Using a Rhythmic Freedom  Until the Boogie-Woogie  Kenny Werner, pianist  Jazz Standard</p>
        <p>The pianist Kenny Werner began his set on Wednesday night with a softly dissonant unaccompanied preface, moving rich chords up and down the keyboard; he quoted from ''Mr. Tambourine Man,'' isolating single notes that he liked and letting them drift and recede. Rather than declarative action, handing the audience a song, it was almost as if he were dowsing for music.</p>

        <p>Using a Rhythmic Freedom  Until the Boogie-Woogie  Kenny Werner, pianist  Jazz Standard</p>
        <p>The pianist Kenny Werner began his set on Wednesday night with a softly dissonant unaccompanied preface, moving rich chords up and down the keyboard; he quoted from ''Mr. Tambourine Man,'' isolating single notes that he liked and letting them drift and recede. Rather than declarative action, handing the audience a song, it was almost as if he were dowsing for music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Werner has been a recognized player for at least 20 years but hasn't received much attention as a band leader; his new trio album on RCA Victor, ''A Delicate Balance,'' might alter that. There are a lot of small-band arrangement ideas on the album that were even better displayed at the Jazz Standard with a different rhythm section -- the bassist Ray Drummond and the drummer Billy Drummond. ''Amonkst,'' a little gloss on Thelonious Monk written by Mr. Werner, was a good example. It sounded as much like Ornette Coleman as Monk; Mr. Werner repeated a cropped, four-note melodic nub to squeeze the joy out of it and didn't worry about how it subdivided into meter.</p>
        <p>A sense of freedom, of not having to delineate the rhythm, was in the air; all three musicians implied it from different angles. Then, suddenly, bass and drums dropped out -- and in an abrupt character change, Mr. Werner turned into a boogie-woogie pianist, pumping out an ironclad eight beats to the bar. As soon as the rhythm section reentered, Mr. Werner fell back on a more spacey version of playing in time.</p>
        <p>Sometimes his deep exploration of harmony without durable melody -- like a building that just grows wider and wider on the ground floor without shooting up into the sky -- could become wearying, as was proved in the set's only ballad. But in other places, like his reworking of Nat Adderley's ''Work Song,'' his grasp of harmonic theory resulted in a completely new work rising out of the familiar. ''When you go to college,'' he said, introducing that piece, ''you learn to reharmonize everything. So in redoing this song, I didn't want to feel like I was wasting my parents' money.''</p>
