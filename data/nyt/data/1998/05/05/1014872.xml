        <p>Senator Lauch Faircloth, a Republican, has been running attack ads in his home state of North Carolina that castigate the leading candidate for the Democratic senatorial nomination, John Edwards, for being a lawyer. ''He makes millions suing people,'' the commercials contend.</p>
        <p>Since the vast majority of senators share Mr. Edwards's occupation, it may surprise them to know that their colleague from North Carolina regards the job as suspect. Mr. Faircloth, a farmer-businessman, is trying  to make voters think their health insurance costs have risen because of Mr. Edwards's success in winning personal-injury cases.</p>

        <p>Senator Lauch Faircloth, a Republican, has been running attack ads in his home state of North Carolina that castigate the leading candidate for the Democratic senatorial nomination, John Edwards, for being a lawyer. ''He makes millions suing people,'' the commercials contend.</p>
        <p>Since the vast majority of senators share Mr. Edwards's occupation, it may surprise them to know that their colleague from North Carolina regards the job as suspect. Mr. Faircloth, a farmer-businessman, is trying  to make voters think their health insurance costs have risen because of Mr. Edwards's success in winning personal-injury cases.</p>
        <p>Today's primary should show whether the ads have hit a nerve. The polls had Mr. Edwards well ahead in the six-candidate race for the nomination, and close to the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff. But at least one other person thinks the Senator is on to something. Mr. Edwards's nearest competitor, D. G. Martin, has started complaining about ''pediatricians and obstetricians being driven out of business because of lawsuits.''</p>
