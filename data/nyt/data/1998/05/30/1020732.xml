      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Esther M Khanna says passing proficiency tests administered for admission to City University of New York's colleges requires skills of seventh grader in writing and reading, and ninth grader in math; claims black and Hispanic students are being shortchanged in name of affirmative action (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your May 27 front-page article on the City University of New York's decision to exclude students who cannot pass proficiency tests in reading, writing and mathematics from its four-year colleges, you note that ''many high school students today graduate without finely honed skills in writing and mathematics.'' However, one shouldn't assume that ''finely honed skills'' are required to pass the proficiency tests.</p>
        <p>As someone who has taken these tests and later on both graded the infamous Writing Assessment Test and taught remedial courses to those who failed it, I can tell you that passing the writing and reading tests requires the skills of a seventh grader, and the math test those of a ninth grader. The three tests are proficiency tests for high school, not college.</p>

        <p>The only ''honed skills'' in evidence have been those used by the New York City Board of Education and CUNY officials, who for almost 30 years have duped the public into believing that shortchanging its predominately black and Hispanic students was a glowing example of affirmative action.</p>
