        <p>Ralph Stanley's grief-blasted mountain-tenor voice, singing a spiritual, can temporarily erase pain, flood the constitution with courage, leave one feeling profoundly alone in the world. At least once, it actually caused violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys were playing in a Columbus, Ohio, bar in 1980. As usual, he hadn't written out a set list for the band; it's their job to catch up to him after he strikes the opening chords or sings the first phrase. The club owner wanted uptempo music, the better to drink by. Mr. Stanley felt like singing gospel songs.</p>
        <p>''The owner's brother was hollering things like, 'Quit singing that graveyard music!' '' remembered Charlie Sizemore, Mr. Stanley's guitar player and lead singer at the time. Mr. Stanley would not obey, and the management cut the sound system. The audience rose up in rebellion against the club owners; even Mr. Sizemore ended up in a fistfight that evening. ''There like to have been a riot,'' Mr. Stanley recalled in an interview. ''But the riot was on my side.''</p>
        <p>At 71, Ralph Stanley is indisputably the grand elder of bluegrass, with  the death of Bill Monroe last year. But he is not a self-promoter. As he sat in the living room of his sprawling one-story house outside Coeburn in southwestern Virginia, he talked about the song ''I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow,'' which, as he performs it, could be his license to enter the region of best singers in the world. ''Most people sing it straight,'' he allowed. ''But I add just a little of my own feel to it. I guess that's why you can pick me out from most anybody else with your back turned to me.''</p>
        <p>He is steeped in the predestinarian theology of Old Primitive Baptism, in which the fate of very small humans is selected by a very great God. That and the gracious manners common to the people of the Clinch Mountains, where he has lived for most of his life, push down most of his potential for egotism. Had he moved to Nashville, as bluegrass musicians like Jim and Jesse, Ricky Skaggs, and Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs did, he would have been garlanded, built into a legend. But he has chosen to stay on a gentleman's farm not far from the house where he grew up and still has not been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Each year he puts on the Memorial Bluegrass Festival next to the site of the old Stanley house and the family cemetery. (It runs May 21-23.)</p>
        <p>But a better index of his importance in the music world is ''Clinch Mountain Country,'' a new double-CD set released by Rebel Records. On it, Mr. Stanley performs duets with a few dozen country and bluegrass stars, including Dwight Yoakam, Patty Loveless, Vince Gill, George Jones, BR5-49 and Junior Brown. Bob Dylan is there, too, singing lead on a memorably doleful version of the song Mr. Stanley wrote with his older brother, Carter, called ''The Lonesome River.'' Mr. Dylan initiated the recording before the rest of the album was planned; he called singing with Mr. Stanley ''the highlight of my career,'' Rebel Records said.</p>
        <p>''That was the first time I ever met him,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''I'd heard of him.'' ''Clinch Mountain Country'' is expected to be the best-selling record Rebel has ever issued. Bluegrass is now primarily a performance art, and Ralph Stanley's records are made mostly for the cognoscenti in editions of 5,000 or less. Rebel's sales expectations for ''Clinch Mountain Country'' are starting at 10 times that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoakam grew up in Pikeville, Ky., 40 miles from the Stanley family home. He said of Mr. Stanley: ''His colloquialism and his performances echo the voices that I heard around the kitchen table singing when I was a child. Bill Monroe, of course, is the godfather of bluegrass. But the Stanley Brothers are really the essence of Appalachian mountain music.''</p>
        <p>A Soft Speaker, A Strong Musician</p>
        <p>A small man with silver hair and alert eyes, Mr. Stanley speaks seriously in a high, dusky voice that's nearly a whisper. He has a stolid demeanor; he is helpful but terse. His music, however, connotes strong decisions. His mournful, melismatic singing -- the way he sometimes stretches a vowel into seven or eight notes of a mode -- transmits the sound of the church music of his youth.</p>
        <p>He is said to abominate the sound of the drums, which Jim and Jesse added to bluegrass art in the 60's. He has no interest in the dobro (a kind of steel guitar), which separates him from some diversified bluegrass bands. And while discussing the music instruction he received in high school, he confessed a marked distaste for the piano.</p>
        <p>Coeburn is not only the home of Ralph and Carter Stanley, who recorded from 1946 until Carter's death in 1966, but also of Jim and Jesse, who are still members of the Grand Ole Opry. From nearby come the famous Carter Family, the singer and banjoist Dock Boggs, and scores of other less renowned heroes of the music. It's a town where teen-age banjo pickers and guitarists assemble every Tuesday night in the back of Edwards' music store to jam on songs like Grayson and Whitter's ''Train 45,'' which dates to 1927, and Ralph Stanley's ''Hard Times,'' a banjo instrumental from 1954. This native art appears to be thriving.</p>
        <p>But mountain music in southwestern Virginia is everywhere and nowhere. Ralph Stanley's music is profoundly, almost embarrassingly old, and is not played on commercial radio stations heard in the area. Though he lives well, Mr. Stanley is not an exalted figure like country superstars are. When he makes a new recording, he doesn't go to the big studios of Nashville, 300 miles away, but to Maggard Sound Studios, 20 miles away in Big Stone Gap, Va.</p>
        <p>''If you went to town and asked, half the people here wouldn't know who he was,'' said Alan Maggard, co-owner of the studio. He said they would be more likely to know who he is because his tour bus used to park behind the Pizza Hut in Coeburn than because of his music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys tour half the year and routinely get top billing at bluegrass festivals. His booking is so easy -- a matter of picking up a ringing phone and accepting annual engagements that fall on the same weekends every year -- that he mostly does it himself. Mr. Stanley implies that he does not really play bluegrass at all. He plays, in his roundabout words, ''what they call the old-time mountain style of what they call bluegrass music.''</p>
        <p>Modern at First, Reverting Later</p>
        <p>The early Stanley Brothers records in the late 40's closely copied the brand-new Bill Monroe sound, with the Monroe band's full-steam-ahead propulsion; Mr. Stanley even adopted the three-finger banjo style, which Earl Scruggs was popularizing with Monroe. From then until 1966, Carter Stanley was interested in keeping the band modern; after his death, Ralph Stanley burrowed back to the music's roots. It's hard to come up with any other contemporary American performer who still routinely plays the first song he ever learned. But Mr. Stanley often sings ''Shout Lula,'' complete with the old-fashioned, strumming ''claw hammer'' banjo style that his mother taught him.</p>
        <p>Some of the most requested songs in Mr. Stanley's repertory, like ''Man of Constant Sorrow'' and ''Rank Stranger,'' are about leaving the Eden of the family hearth for the cold world outside. The details of misery are lingered over; it's a painfully sad music.</p>
        <p>''In his religion there is fatalism, but also a sense of charity,'' says Joe Wilson, director of the National Council for the Traditional Arts and a scholar of Appalachian music. Fatalism and charity can both be found on Smith Ridge, the site of Mr. Stanley's Old Home Place. It is the hill where Mr. Stanley holds his festival, and where the family members are buried. ''Rest in the Peaceful Mountains,'' reads a sign above the entrance to the small grave site. ''Carter wrote that song,'' Mr. Stanley says as he steps through the opening in the white fence.</p>
        <p>Keeping the Family Together Forever</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanley's mother lies here in a row of five above-ground graves. ''See, Carter was buried first,'' he says, motioning to his brother's grave. ''When his wife died, she didn't want to be put underground. So we took him up.'' Next to them are empty graves for Mr. Stanley and his wife, Jimmie.</p>
        <p>From this high spot you can see the Clinch Mountains arranged below like sleeping green dinosaurs. It's idyllic. If most of the America that produced its roots music is lost, a moment on top of Smith Ridge makes you understand what the Stanley Brothers were singing about.</p>
        <p>Next he visits some builders, making ready the foundation for a prefabricated house next to the site where he grew up -- a place, he explains, where he can ''go and reminisce when I want to.'' (A cousin lives in the house on the original site.) ''Looking better all the time!'' he beams, and chats with them about mortar and anchor bolts; he's involved. In back is the sloping hollow where his parents grew vegetables; now it's just a beautiful green vale, with a black bull and some cows.</p>
        <p>Back at the house, Mr. Stanley's wife is waiting, as is his son, Ralph Two, the lead singer and guitarist in his band, and his 5-year-old grandson, Nathan Edmund Stanley, a developing singer and banjoist who has already started to claim a spot in Mr. Stanley's shows. As he passes various landmarks -- the spot where he would be picked up and taken to school, the place where Carter used to live -- it is remarked that he has unusually fond memories of his childhood.</p>
        <p>''I do,'' he nodded. ''I'd like to do it over,'' he said, thinking through the fantasy. ''For about 30 days. Then change back.''</p>
