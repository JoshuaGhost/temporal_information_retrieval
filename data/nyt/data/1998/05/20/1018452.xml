        <p>Liu Xiaoying, 80 years old, widowed and full of spark, decided to move into the East Wind Elderly Home last fall. It is a privately run 15-bed home off a bustling lane where, with help from her seven children, she paid an entrance fee of more than $1,000 and now pays $90 a month to live. She walks to the park to practice tai chi; she window shops; she gets visits from her children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''They are busy working, and they just have different living habits from me,'' she says of her children. ''I like it here,'' she adds, giggling that she has put on 12 pounds since arriving.</p>

        <p>Liu Xiaoying, 80 years old, widowed and full of spark, decided to move into the East Wind Elderly Home last fall. It is a privately run 15-bed home off a bustling lane where, with help from her seven children, she paid an entrance fee of more than $1,000 and now pays $90 a month to live. She walks to the park to practice tai chi; she window shops; she gets visits from her children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''They are busy working, and they just have different living habits from me,'' she says of her children. ''I like it here,'' she adds, giggling that she has put on 12 pounds since arriving.</p>
        <p>A boom in old-age homes, in defiance of the traditional practice of parents' staying with their children, is one of the more dramatic signs of China's demographic aging.</p>
        <p>He Yixi, who is 35, runs the East Wind center for profit, renting the building from a grateful district government. He also runs a much larger for-profit elderly home, with a nursing wing for the infirm, in another part of the city, as well as two for-profit kindergartens.</p>
        <p>''This market has potential,'' he says of elderly care. ''I hope to set up more and more of these homes.''</p>
        <p>His hope is shared by the Chinese Government, which is inviting individual investors and corporations to operate old-age and nursing homes to help meet a soaring social need.</p>
        <p>The graying of the world's largest population, although still in its initial stage, is already affecting everything from family living traditions to urban attitudes about the merits of sons versus daughters.</p>
        <p>The rising proportion of elderly people reflects longer life expectancies and the effects of China's stringent family planning policies. Many Chinese baby boomers have had only one child and are now facing layoffs at work, giving rise to fears about their fate in old age.</p>
        <p>Because the rising share of elderly retirees coincides with the collapse of the Communist system of cradle-to-grave welfare, China must also scramble to create Western-style pension and social security programs on a vast scale. In the meantime it faces the daunting task of providing for a generation that never expected to be cast loose in old age.</p>
        <p>As in the West, the real challenge will begin when the baby boomers, the offspring of a surge in births in the 1950's, begin to retire after the year 2010, then continue on into their 70's and 80's, many needing financial and physical help.</p>
        <p>Right now, more than 120 million Chinese, or about 10 percent of the population, are over 60, the retirement age here for most people. By the middle of the coming century, because of longer survival and smaller families, one in every four Chinese, or 410 million, will be aged 60 or more, according to Government projections. If the aging is not yet as advanced as in Europe or North America, it is occurring as China remains, at best, a middle-income country, without the resources that advanced Western countries have lavished on the elderly.</p>
        <p>China's baby boomers face some special problems, noted Peng Xizhe, director of the Institute of Population Research at Fudan University in Shanghai. Many of them lost the chance for a good education because of the tumult of the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976, when colleges were often closed down and students were sent to the countryside for a ''red education.''</p>
        <p>Once married, many were allowed to have only one child. This means they are less likely to have children able and willing to care for them. Already, many urban people say, in a reversal of the old norm, that a daughter is preferable to a son because she is more likely to attend to the parents.</p>
        <p>And now, with the stringent program of pruning redundant workers from state enterprises and Government agencies, tens of millions of the baby boomers are being laid off from their jobs, hobbling their ability to build equity in the new pension plans and in some cases to provide for their elderly parents.</p>
        <p>Most of China's elderly, especially in rural areas, still live with their families, and the Government will do all it can to encourage family support, said Zhang Wenfan, head of the China National Committee on Aging, an official advisory group. The severe shortage of housing in most of China often puts children in competition with their parents for space, and anguish over housing disputes and relations with the children have been common topics for callers to Beijing's recently created hot line for elderly women.</p>
        <p>In the cities in recent years, grown children have often lived with their parents less out of filial piety than because they had no alternative. Many young couples are eager to move into less crowded quarters as soon they can rent or buy their own place. But sometimes children put pressure on their elderly parents to move out.</p>
        <p>Honoring parents is a pillar of Confucian tradition, and the Government  wrote an obligation of children to help support their parents into a 1996 law on the rights of the elderly and into another law on the rights of women.</p>
        <p>A growing awareness of that obligation has even led to a spurt of lawsuits from neglected parents. In each of the last two years, the Qianxi Rural Legal Services Center in Hebei Province has handled about 10 new cases in rural areas involving neglect of parents, said the director, Wang Xuzhen. Some are resolved through mediation while others have gone to court, where the children are forced to pay or are sometimes jailed for neglect. No national data on such lawsuits are available.</p>
        <p>''Traditionally, people didn't think it was right to sue their children,'' Ms. Wang said. ''But now they are gaining a better sense of their rights.''</p>
        <p>China's economic surge has also meant that more children are working far from home, or even live abroad. Already, officials say, one in three of the urban elderly lives alone. Cities are developing services and day centers to support those staying at home, but the demand is also growing for group residences and nursing homes.</p>
        <p>''The concept of the people has changed quite quickly,'' said Liang Shuquan, deputy chief of the Guangzhou civil affairs bureau, who added  that more grown children are too busy to provide proper care and that more old people prefer living in group homes where their social and physical needs are more easily met.</p>
        <p>''Parents want their children to work hard and succeed,'' Mr. Liang said. ''Nobody is just parking their parents in these places.'' He expressed confidence that regulations would prevent the patient abuses that have periodically plagued nursing homes in the West, although China has nowhere near the depth of rules and oversight that experience has required in the United States.</p>
        <p>Wu Yaohua, 85, a former teacher, is emblematic of the new trend. He had lived alone for nine years; his wife is dead, his daughter lives in Hong Kong, and his four grandchildren all live in the United States. But caring for himself got harder, and one day, he said, his daughter asked, ''Dad, do you want to move into one of these homes?''</p>
        <p>With his daughter, he scouted the options last fall, choosing the East Wind center. ''Life is good here, although it's just a middle-level place,'' he said. ''But on your own you can't make it like this for $90 a month.''</p>
        <p>Cities like Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing are expanding their public homes where they house a mix of paying and welfare clients. But led by Guangzhou, which in 1996 was the first city to authorize private homes, they are also turning to entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>''It's impossible for the Government to set up enough of these homes -- it doesn't have the money or the management skills,'' said Feng Chengxiong, deputy director of civil affairs for the city district where the East Wind center is situated. ''This is the future trend,'' he said of the center with its mix of government sponsorship and private profit.</p>
        <p>For a long time, every Chinese town had charity homes where old people with no money or children would languish. But in the last few years a better brand of home, some public, some private, has attracted at least 100,000 Chinese, according to official estimates, with one-third of the residents paying their own way. And the numbers are climbing fast.</p>
        <p>Even as it seeks investors, Guangzhou has steadily expanded its largest city-run home for the elderly, a pleasant, spacious center with the feel of a garden apartment complex, situated far into the countryside.  (Conditions in this showcase, in China's richest province, are not likely to be equaled in many parts of China.)</p>
        <p>Like some American elderly communities, it has a range of quarters and services, depending on whether residents are healthy and independent, need limited living assistance or are severely incapacitated with Alzheimer's or other diseases.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's the center had 300 beds. By the end of this year it will have 680 beds, and by the end of next year 780. The residents -- most of them women, as in any country -- usually live two to a room, with the rooms clustered around common areas with a television. They enjoy ballroom dancing, singing and art sessions, and many talk about the fresh, unpolluted air.</p>
        <p>About 30 percent of the residents are paying customers, including locals who pay $120 a month and some Chinese who pay more after returning from careers in Hong Kong, Singapore or Macau to spend their final days here. The others, too poor to pay and deemed unable to make it on their own in the city, are sent by public welfare officials and must hand over any pensions they receive as partial payment.</p>
        <p>As ideas, living habits and demographics change, China is just starting to face some of the more wrenching personal and ethical issues that come with a growing number of the very aged.</p>
        <p>On a recent sunny day, a middle-aged couple brought flowers for the man's 86-year-old mother, whom they had recently moved from their own home into the nursing section of the center after she developed severe Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>The 59-year-old son, Du Xihuan, said he and his wife still had two children living at home. He said that in the past, having his mother in the house had been manageable. ''Then she got seriously ill,'' he said, a bit sheepish about discussing an entirely understandable decision, ''so we had to bring her here.''</p>
