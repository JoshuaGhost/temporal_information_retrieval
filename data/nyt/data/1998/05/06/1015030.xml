        <p>First, there was the suggestion that the city might like to celebrate the May 14 finale of ''Seinfeld'' with a big outdoor party at Yankee Stadium. It was rejected. Then Times Square and Bryant Park were suggested. Again, rejected. And last week, Central Park came into the picture.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, the city said that there would be no party after all to mark the show that is, after all, about nothing.</p>
        <p>''At this point, nothing is planned,'' said Henry J. Stern, the city's Parks Commissioner.</p>
        <p>Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., which has booked $1.8 million of commercials for the last episode of the NBC show, had hoped to convene what it had labeled Seinfest, a mass viewing with games and contests related to television's most popular comedy series.</p>
        <p>But even though the city has embraced some commercial events, like last summer's parade in honor of The Walt Disney Company's movie ''Hercules,'' the city rejected Times Square and Bryant Park for a ''Seinfeld'' sign-off because of concerns that the event might draw a large and uncontrollable crowd. It was estimated, for instance, that as many as 35,000 people might show up in Bryant Park, dwarfing the 4,000 people who ordinarily turn out to watch movies during the Parks Department's regular summer outdoor series.</p>
        <p>As a compromise, the city suggested Central Park's North Meadow. Fuji officials agreed to study the idea, then decided to cancel the whole shebang because time was running out.</p>
        <p>''There really wasn't enough to time to put on the event that we wanted to do,'' said Mindy Kramer, a spokeswoman for Fuji who is not, she quickly volunteered, related to the manic character on the show. ''We're certainly disappointed.''</p>
        <p>So while the show is set in New York, the city will not mark the last comic moments of Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer. But  around the country, a number of NBC affiliates plan to rent out amphitheaters and other sites to show the finale.</p>
        <p>In St. Louis, a downtown civic group plans to project the show on the side of a seven-story downtown building -- with the cooperation of the city, which will block traffic in the area.</p>
