        <p>NEWS  Blanket Attraction</p>
        <p>The 34th season of free concerts in the parks will begin on the Great Lawn of Central Park on July 21, when Kurt Masur, making his first parks appearance since 1993, will lead the New York Philharmonic in works by Mussorgsky, Prokofiev and Ravel. When the orchestra returns to the Great Lawn on July 30, Roberto Minczuk, music director of the Ribeirao Preto Symphony of Brazil, will make his debut with the Philharmonic, in a program of works by John Williams, Lorenzo Fernandez, Tchaikovsky and Dvorak. Other concerts are scheduled for Westchester Community College (July 23), Heckscher State Park (25), Cunningham Park (26), Brookhaven Amphitheater (27), Van Cortlandt Park (28), Prospect Park (29) and Miller Field (31) on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Structured Life</p>
        <p>Frank O. Gehry, the architect of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, was awarded the new Friedrich Kiesler prize yesterday in Vienna. Hans Hollein, the Austrian architect who led the international jury that chose Mr. Gehry, praised ''the courage you feel in his work, which is shorn of all ideology.'' Mr. Gehry, 69, is also noted for his design for the American Center in Paris, among others. The $60,000 prize is awarded by the Friedrich Kiesler Foundation, named for the Austro-American architect who died in 1965.</p>
        <p>Teamwork</p>
        <p>For the Tony Award-winning composer Cy Coleman and the playwright and novelist A. E. Hotchner, tomorrow night is opening night for their new musical. Titled ''Exactly Like You,'' this irreverent courtroom comedy about love and marriage will play through May 31 at Goodspeed-at-Chester/The Norma Terris Theater in Connecticut, where the Goodspeed Opera House develops new musicals. Among Mr. Coleman's many credits are ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' ''City of Angels'' and, currently on Broadway, ''The Life.'' Mr. Hotchner's many works include ''Papa Hemingway.''</p>
        <p>Capital Fun</p>
        <p>As the master of ceremonies at the Kennedy Center, where awards for the best in Washington theater were distributed on Monday night, Pat Carroll found the capital the perfect city for the stage. ''Aren't all the White House lawyers out of a Moliere farce?'' she asked. And, referring to Monica Lewinsky's supposed friend, she wondered: ''Isn't there a bit of Iago in Linda Tripp?'' Indeed, a production of ''Othello'' was a nominee. But it was Eugene O'Neill's ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' that won the most awards: best resident play, supporting actress in a resident play (Franchelle Stewart Dorn), supporting actor in a resident play (Robert Stella) and costume design in a resident play (Jane Greenwood).</p>
