        <p>Treasury securities declined for a second day yesterday, as investors await Friday's jobs data and ponder the probability of an increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Prices were also weighed down by a meeting between President Clinton and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond dropped 21/32, to a price of 102 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.98 percent, from 5.93 percent on Monday.</p>
        <p>Many moves in the bond market come on speculation alone and yesterday's meeting at the White House was no exception. The meeting in all probability was to update the President on all of the nuances of the current economic and inflation picture. Some of the downward price pressures came as some market participants began speculating that the meeting might mean something else: for instance, that the Government was giving the central bank permission to raise interest rates.</p>
        <p>''News tape items by Fed officials, speculation about a meeting between the White House and Chairman Greenspan, and other assorted sundry tidbits of market gossip and innuendoes generally kept bond prices within a relatively contained range in thin trading,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.</p>
        <p>He said market reaction to economic data released yesterday was barely perceptible. The index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March, an expected outcome as a result of increases in stock prices and money supply.</p>
        <p>The employment data for April will be released on Friday and market attention will be focused on the payroll number in order to interpret the trend. Mr. Fine said that the number of new jobs added to the economy averaged 205,000 a month in the first quarter, which he thought was a relatively small number compared with recent economic growth. Most analysts expect a gain of roughly 250,000 jobs for April.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, in the corporate market the AT&amp;T Capital Corporation sold $1.05 billion through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities. The debt offering was broken down into $750 million of three-year notes priced to yield 6.269 percent, or about 63-hundredths of a percentage point more than a three-year Treasury, and $300 million of seven-year notes, yielding 6.614 percent, or about 88-hundredths of a percentage point over the seven-year Treasury note.</p>
