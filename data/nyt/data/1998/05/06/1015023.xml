        <p>It happened in a legislative nanosecond, a debate and vote so quick that anyone who stepped out for a cup of coffee would have missed it. It involved an issue that has been likened to political poison, and the sooner lawmakers got it onto the Governor's desk, the better.</p>
        <p>It was a pay increase.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly voted this evening to increase the salaries of its members and five other elected state offices, after going nearly 10 years without a raise. The measure received bipartisan support, and the proposal was not about big dollars. Rank-and-file lawmakers will see their annual salaries increase to $21,788 as of January 1999, from $16,760.</p>
        <p>But the move is one that causes politicians in legislatures across the country to run for cover, and even here, in the state with the highest per capita income in the country, the behind-the-scenes negotiations for a pay raise were delicate and top secret.</p>
        <p>Gov. John G. Rowland, who last year said that he would veto any pay raise, said earlier this week that he would sign the bill, but only if his office was excluded. The leadership of the House of Representatives refused to vote on it until assured that the Senate had the votes to follow along. And top legislative leaders had been having closed-door discussions on it all week.</p>
        <p>''It really scares them,'' Alan Rosenthal, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University and an expert on state legislatures, said, describing the attitude toward raises in legislatures around the country. ''There's this great fear that they'll be struck by a bolt of lightning, though there's no evidence that ever happens.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, around the country legislators bend over backward to distance themselves from pay raises, fearing that challengers will use the issue to unseat them. In New Jersey this year, the issue was handed to a retiring state senator to bring out, and he introduced it one evening after many of his colleagues had gone home. It still failed.</p>
        <p>New York legislators have over the past few years refused even to admit that the issue was under consideration.</p>
        <p>But in Connecticut the situation has become so out of balance -- secretaries and janitors in the Capitol make more than the leaders of the House and Senate -- that both parties were ready to join together to push for the measure, forgoing any opportunity to use it for partisan political advantage.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a Republican vote or a Democratic vote,'' said State Senator George C. Jepsen, a Stamford Democrat who was an architect of the deal. ''Some top legislators have had to leave because they can't afford to stay, and good people are deterred from running because of the money.''</p>
        <p>And State Senator George L. Gunther, a Republican of Stratford who has served longer than anyone else in the Senate, shook Mr. Jepsen's hand afterward, thanking him. ''I think we're worth a lot more than that,'' Mr. Gunther said.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, some who opposed the increase. State Senator M. Adela Eads, a Republican of Kent, remarked that legislators knew what the parameters were when they took the job. ''There shouldn't be any surprises,'' she added.</p>
        <p>While the Connecticut jobs are technically not full time -- the legislature is only in session 10 months every two years -- Connecticut legislators said that the job had become more of a year-round responsibility and that it was increasingly difficult to balance their political responsibilities with their need to earn a living.</p>
        <p>The proposal also raises the Attorney General's salary, to $75,000 from $60,000; the lieutenant governor's, to $71,000 from $55,000, and the treasurer's, to $70,000 from $50,000. The governor would remain at $78,000.</p>
        <p>The measure passed the House this evening, 119 to 27. The vote was  closer in the Senate, 19 to 17, though Mr. Jepsen said several lawmakers in less secure seats had to be told to vote ''no'' so as not to expose themselves needlessly to a political risk.</p>
        <p>And the issue was clearly one that no one in either chamber of the legislature wanted to linger on.</p>
        <p>The Senate ran through the matter in about seven minutes.</p>
        <p>The sometimes talkative members of the House, who spent an hour Monday discussing legislation about dry cleaning, disposed of the matter today in less than five minutes.</p>
        <p>Only one speaker, Representative William R. Dyson, took the floor to introduce and discuss the proposal, and it appeared that he could not get away fast enough -- he had to be reminded to call for a vote after he sat down prematurely.</p>
