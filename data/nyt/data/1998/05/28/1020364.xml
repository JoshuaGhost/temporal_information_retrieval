        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 23) attributes the Asian financial crisis to government corruption, and political reform to the demands of global capitalists. Surely the recent financial upheavals in the region could not have resulted simply from the sudden effects of corruption. They indicate a role by audacious, profit-minded and skittish international money managers and speculators. These are apostles of laissez-faire, not of reform.</p>

        <p>Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 23) attributes the Asian financial crisis to government corruption, and political reform to the demands of global capitalists. Surely the recent financial upheavals in the region could not have resulted simply from the sudden effects of corruption. They indicate a role by audacious, profit-minded and skittish international money managers and speculators. These are apostles of laissez-faire, not of reform.</p>
        <p>Global capital flows do contribute to growth, as Mr. Friedman suggests. But in East Asia, the savings rate has been high and the export balance favorable; productivity has been growing, and markets are open as demanded by international institutions.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem was that large inflows of short-term capital in search of high returns were more than the region needed and led to market failure.</p>
        <p>RUBEN P. MENDEZ  New York, May 23, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is historian of the United Nations Development Program.</p>
