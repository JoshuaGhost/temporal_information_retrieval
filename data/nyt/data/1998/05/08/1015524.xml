        <p>The General Accident Insurance Company, the state's 10th largest auto insurer, must pay a fine of $550,500 to settle charges that it turned away eligible customers in an effort to leave New Jersey's insurance market illegally. It was the largest fine imposed on an auto insurer in New Jersey, state officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement reached on Wednesday, the company, based in Philadelphia, will also hire five new agents in New Jersey and write an additional 3,800 insurance policies in 25 cities in the state, said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Banking and Insurance.</p>

        <p>The General Accident Insurance Company, the state's 10th largest auto insurer, must pay a fine of $550,500 to settle charges that it turned away eligible customers in an effort to leave New Jersey's insurance market illegally. It was the largest fine imposed on an auto insurer in New Jersey, state officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement reached on Wednesday, the company, based in Philadelphia, will also hire five new agents in New Jersey and write an additional 3,800 insurance policies in 25 cities in the state, said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Banking and Insurance.</p>
        <p>Last year, General Accident turned down several investigators who were posing as customers even though they legally qualified for car insurance. Under state law, insurers are compelled to write policies for any driver who has fewer than nine points on his or her license, Ms. Comfort said.</p>
        <p>State officials suspected that General Accident was planning to leave New Jersey because it dismissed 31 agents in the state from 1994 to 1997 and cut the number of its policies to less than 76,000 from nearly 100,000  during the same period. State law requires a company seeking to drop its business in New Jersey to inform state regulators ahead of time to insure an orderly departure.</p>
        <p>Officials of General Accident did not respond to phone messages yesterday.</p>
