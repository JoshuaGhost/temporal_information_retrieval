        <p>After yesterday's violence in Indonesia, foreign companies began taking precautions to protect their employees there.</p>
        <p>Several companies said yesterday that they were closing their operations and evacuating their expatriate staff, but others were sitting tight and said that they did not feel their people were in imminent danger.</p>
        <p>The State Department announced yesterday that it would evacuate all nonessential personnel from Indonesia and issued a travel warning urging Americans to postpone travel to the country. The moves went beyond Wednesday's decision to evacuate the families of embassy staff and other government employees.</p>
        <p>There are nearly 10,000 Americans currently in Indonesia, according to the State Department. But because the country is made up of hundreds of islands spread over thousands of miles, many of the Americans are far away from the capital of Jakarta, where some of the most serious rioting is taking place.</p>
        <p>The Atlantic Richfield Company said yesterday that it planned to evacuate about 320 workers in its Jakarta office and their families to Singapore but would keep the remainder of its 2,500 employees in the country.</p>
        <p>The evacuees include about 90 American and other non-Indonesian employees plus their families and guests, said Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for the company, an oil and gas producer. He said that the company's Jakarta office was closed early on Thursday to allow employees to go home and prepare for the evacuation, which would be by a chartered airplane.</p>
        <p>General Motors, which has a small plant assembling Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicles about 20 miles east of Jakarta, said that it had begun evacuating its 14 expatriate employees and their families and planned to have all of them out of the country by the end of Friday.</p>
        <p>Other American companies, including American Express, Lucent Technologies, Citicorp, as well as ABN Ambro Holding N.V. of the Netherlands and Deutsche Bank of Germany closed their offices in downtown Jakarta indefinitely yesterday as the unrest, which has been swelling for months, reached a new level, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Ascanio Markinotti, managing director of Regent Private Equity, a London-based investment fund, arrived in the capital two days ago to close some property deals.</p>
        <p>''We figured the worse it gets, the better the deals,'' he said yesterday. But Mr. Markinotti got more than he bargained for.</p>
        <p>After a negotiating session yesterday, he was trapped with several Indonesian employees near the city center. Riots were raging to the north and south and two buildings outside the office tower the group was in were burning. Mr. Markinotti was forced to rent hotel rooms for himself and the employees, who were afraid to return home.</p>
        <p>''We just did not feel comfortable trying to cross town,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Holloway, director of operations in Asia for the Kroll-O'Geara Company in Hong Kong, a risk management consultant, said that there were reports that rioters were stopping and ransacking cars on the road to Jakarta's airport. He said that he was advising his clients to find a safe refuge and stay put.</p>
        <p>Some companies kept their offices open and had no plans to evacuate their foreign staff. Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold, which operates a copper mine on the island of Irian Jaya, 2,000 miles from Jakarta, said that its small office in the capital was not affected.</p>
        <p>''No one has been evacuated at this time and our office is open for business,'' said Garland Robinette, a spokesman for the company, which is based in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>The Newmont Mining Corporation, which operates a gold mine on the island of Sulawesi, 1,500 miles Northeast of Jakarta, and is building another mine on the island of Sumbawa, 950 miles east of the capital, said that neither operation was affected. The company has restricted travel to Indonesia from its Denver headquarters but its Jakarta offices remained open and it was not planning to evacuate any of its staff.</p>
        <p>''We're keeping a close watch on things but at this point we don't feel that people are in danger,'' said Doug Hock, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>But for foreign business people who do not have the resources of a large company behind them the situation on the ground is a lot more scary. Peter Cochran, who imports golf carts and small utility vehicles, said that he sent his Indonesian employees home an hour after they arrived at work yesterday.</p>
        <p>He has seen his share of unrest in Indonesia, he said in a telephone interview, ''but this is completely different -- this is very scary.''</p>
        <p>UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE MULTINATIONALS  Correction:  May 16, 1998, Saturday  An article yesterday about precautions being taken by foreign companies in Indonesia misspelled the name of a company that advises corporations on security. It is the Kroll-O'Gara Company, not Kroll-O'Geara.</p>
