        <p>The drama of an urbane gay man returning to the provinces to confront the ghosts of his troubled youth is such a familiar scenario that it hardly bears repeating. But Thom Fitzgerald's film ''The Hanging Garden,'' which veers wildly between harrowing kitchen-sink realism and surreal fantasy, adds enough bizarre touches (including the naming of its characters after various herbs and flowers) to this version of the prodigal son parable that it reinvents the formula.</p>
        <p>One unsettling message conveyed by the Canadian film is that no matter how drastically you may overhaul your physical image, beneath your bright and shiny new shell, a wounded, frightened child still lurks. All you have to do to find him is go home again. As the movie skips around in time and shows its grown-up characters observing their younger selves, it suggests that as we grow up we become like redwood trees: all the layers of our lives down to our very cores exist at the same time.</p>

        <p>The drama of an urbane gay man returning to the provinces to confront the ghosts of his troubled youth is such a familiar scenario that it hardly bears repeating. But Thom Fitzgerald's film ''The Hanging Garden,'' which veers wildly between harrowing kitchen-sink realism and surreal fantasy, adds enough bizarre touches (including the naming of its characters after various herbs and flowers) to this version of the prodigal son parable that it reinvents the formula.</p>
        <p>One unsettling message conveyed by the Canadian film is that no matter how drastically you may overhaul your physical image, beneath your bright and shiny new shell, a wounded, frightened child still lurks. All you have to do to find him is go home again. As the movie skips around in time and shows its grown-up characters observing their younger selves, it suggests that as we grow up we become like redwood trees: all the layers of our lives down to our very cores exist at the same time.</p>
        <p>When the film's main character, Sweet William (Chris Leavins), visits his Nova Scotia family for the first time in 10 years, this formerly obese teen-ager is so svelte as to be hardly recognizable. No sooner has he returned for the wedding of his older sister Rosemary (Kerry Fox) than he begins seeing younger versions of himself, including the suicidally inclined 350-pound teen-ager (played with a sullen poker-faced dignity by Troy Veinotte) that he used to be.</p>
        <p>The home to which William returns is a rats' nest of bitterness, illness and domestic violence and the wedding itself a chaotic, drunken affair. The bride, on her way to the ceremony, mutters a stream of angry curses. After the wedding, the groom (Joel S. Keller) on whom the teen-age William had a serious crush, makes a pass at the man who once adored him.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the ceremony, William's fanatically religious grandmother, Grace (Joan Orenstein), who suffers from Alzheimer's, shouts crazily out of the window of her attic sick room. By the end of the afternoon, his father, Whiskey Mac (Peter MacNeill), a gardener, has passed out. Hours later, William's long-suffering mother, Iris (Seana McKenna), simply disappears. At the wedding, William also meets and bonds with Violet (Christine Dunsworth), a frisky, tomboyish little girl who is introduced as his younger sister but who is not what she seems to be.</p>
        <p>Some of the movie's strongest moments evoke the excruciating tension and claustrophobia of growing up in a dysfunctional family. A scene in which Whiskey Mac brutally lashes out and smacks his teen-age son while Iris watches helplessly, barely containing her rage, is so harsh it makes you wince. So is another flashback, in which Iris, alarmed by her teen-age son's recently discovered homosexual tendencies, drags him to the home of a prostitute to be sexually initiated and waits outside the bedroom, listening to the creak of bedsprings, until the deed is done.</p>
        <p>''The Hanging Garden'' is powerfully acted, but its wild gyrations of tone never find a stylistic equilibrium. If the wedding is staged as a black comic farce, other scenes, including a fantasy in which the teen-age William hangs himself in the backyard, have a mawkishly self-pitying undertone. And there are many moments when the lines between fantasy and realism, between farce and drama seem unnecessarily hazy.</p>
        <p>''The Hanging Garden'' suggests that what's called the bosom of the family is rarely a soft and comforting home in which to nestle. It's much more likely to be a bitter cul de sac in which the best defense is a timely escape.</p>
        <p>''The Hanging Garden'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanity.</p>
