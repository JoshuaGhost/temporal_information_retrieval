        <p>Roughly half of the country's state legislatures are currently in session. So what is going on out there?</p>
        <p>State Net, a Sacramento group that follows bill developments in state capitols, reports that so far this year 69,457 measures have been dropped into the hoppers -- about average -- bringing the total number up for consideration thus far, including those carried over from previous sessions, to 145,824. Just last week another 911 were thrown in.</p>

        <p>Roughly half of the country's state legislatures are currently in session. So what is going on out there?</p>
        <p>State Net, a Sacramento group that follows bill developments in state capitols, reports that so far this year 69,457 measures have been dropped into the hoppers -- about average -- bringing the total number up for consideration thus far, including those carried over from previous sessions, to 145,824. Just last week another 911 were thrown in.</p>
        <p>The hot new issues?</p>
        <p>Many come straight from today's headlines: regulating and taxing Internet activity, controlling pollution from animal waste, deregulating electric utilities to increase competition, toughening campaign finance laws, limiting affirmative action programs, mandating insurance health benefits for women and children, helping Holocaust victims win insurance claims, regulating the use of union dues for political causes, financing new sports stadiums, protecting computer operators from lawsuits resulting from breakdowns and protecting critics of various types of food products from law suits.</p>
        <p>Progress?</p>
        <p>As of last Saturday, 15,167 bills and resolutions had been sent on to governors for consideration; 953 reached final votes last week.</p>
        <p>In a typical year, about 25 of every 100 bills make it to final passage by the state legislature. Governors typically sign 20 of the 25.</p>
        <p>''States tend to pass a higher percentage of bills than Congress does, if such numbers mean anything,'' said Virginia Nelson of State Net.</p>
        <p>Congress typically passes roughly 15 percent of its bills.</p>
        <p>This year, as in many years past, a number of the hot issues before state legislatures are issues that Congress has avoided acting on, such as campaign finance.</p>
