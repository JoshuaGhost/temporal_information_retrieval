        <p>WHEN 100 companies secretly tested software designed to find out what employees were doing on the Internet, 68 of the companies found that at least some workers were logging on to peep at pornography.</p>
        <p>The source of that finding is Elron Software, a company in Cambridge, Mass., that sells a program to track employees' Internet use on networked computers. In its recent test, Elron allowed the companies to try the software free. The employees were not told that they were being spied upon, and the companies faxed the logs of Web site hits back to Elron, where they were analyzed. Elron declined to identify the companies that participated in the test, saying they had been promised confidentiality in exchange for the logs.</p>

        <p>WHEN 100 companies secretly tested software designed to find out what employees were doing on the Internet, 68 of the companies found that at least some workers were logging on to peep at pornography.</p>
        <p>The source of that finding is Elron Software, a company in Cambridge, Mass., that sells a program to track employees' Internet use on networked computers. In its recent test, Elron allowed the companies to try the software free. The employees were not told that they were being spied upon, and the companies faxed the logs of Web site hits back to Elron, where they were analyzed. Elron declined to identify the companies that participated in the test, saying they had been promised confidentiality in exchange for the logs.</p>
        <p>''Some companies had 10 pages of inappropriate addresses, and some had only a few,'' said Kelly Haggerty, product marketing manager at Elron, a subsidiary of Elron Electronic Technologies of Israel.</p>
        <p>Elron, one of the largest of a dozen or so companies that make software to track and block Internet use, has sold its product, Internet Manager, to about 1,000 corporations, Mr. Haggerty said. Customers include the American Red Cross, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Juilliard School and Lionel Trains, none of which took part in the recent test.</p>
        <p>Managers want to put a stop to sex-surfing on the Internet, Mr. Haggerty said, because it wastes time, costs money if the company pays for Internet use and, if it becomes widespread, may slow down an entire network. Further, people who dally with Net pornography at work may leave a corporation open to sexual-harassment lawsuits by co-workers offended by the lewd images.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haggerty said the number of sexually explicit sites on the Internet was estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, with more popping up all the time. Creating a program to recognize each site would be impossible. Instead, Mr. Haggerty said, Elron's software works by looking for suspicious words in the addresses of Web sites and alerting a manager when they are used. The obvious terms include sex, nude, porn, adult, XXX, play and drugs. Those terms sometimes lead to innocent hits, which can be ignored by a manager, but more often the terms point to what Mr. Haggerty called ''inappropriate'' sites. A second list, containing 15 cruder expressions, is shown only to customers who think they can stand to see it. About three-quarters decline for various reason, Mr. Haggerty said, and those words are then omitted from the filter.</p>
        <p>Companies can just monitor employees' use or set up the program to automatically block their access to certain sites.</p>
        <p>Employers can also catch workers red-handed, or perhaps red-faced, because the system operates in real time and can alert the boss as soon as someone clicks on a suspicious site. Mr. Haggerty said a manager whose company had bought the program had it linked to his pager so that he could be alerted as he walked around the office. He would then head for the offender's cubicle, stroll up behind the person and ask, ' ''Hey, what've you got there?' '' Mr. Haggerty said.</p>
        <p>Once people know they are being watched, Mr. Haggerty said, they tend to avoid forbidden sites. In some cases, he said, companies reported that just running the software as a monthlong test made such a dent in the amount of surfing that management decided not to buy Elron's product. But some managers came back later, he said, because they secretly ran the test a second time and discovered that activity had picked up again, after employees figured out that the first test was over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haggerty said he did not know how Elron's clients treated offenders but added that another survey was expected to answer that question within a few weeks. In other situations, people who made a habit of visiting sex sites on company time were dismissed. Compaq Computer dismissed 20 employees several years ago because each had visited pornography sites more than 1,000 times.</p>
        <p>Not all Internet peepers are treated equally, it seems. Mr. Haggerty said a company asked Elron to configure the software to exclude monitoring of the chief officer. The request came from the administrator of the computer network, who did not want to risk capturing embarrassing data about the boss. A few other companies have issued similar instructions, Mr. Haggerty said, and Elron has complied. ''We don't want to get the network administrator fired,'' he said.</p>
