        <p>Congressional negotiators said today that they had reached agreement on a measure that would substantially cut the cost of bus and subway travel in the New York metropolitan region and across the nation by allowing employers to give workers up to $65 a month in tax-free mass transit benefits instead of salary.</p>
        <p>The provision will be part of a sweeping $200 billion transportation bill that Congress is hurrying to finish by Friday night, in time for its Memorial Day recess. Though the broad outlines of the bill have been agreed to, House and Senate negotiators were still struggling tonight with several thorny issues, including how to allocate $167 billion in highway spending among the states over the next six years.</p>
        <p>Fights also broke out today over a raft of amendments to the highway bill intended to scale back or delay Federal environmental programs, from dredging toxic PCB's from the Housatonic River in Massachusetts to establishing tougher standards for the pollutants that cause smog and haze.</p>
        <p>Several New York State Democrats denounced the PCB amendment, which was offered by Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a  Republican from Glens Falls, saying that it could lead to delays in removing PCB-contaminated soil from the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>The General Electric Company is responsible for most of the PCB contamination in both the Housatonic and the Hudson, and will be required to pay for any cleanup ordered by the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>Congressional aides also said tonight that they had reached broad agreement on funding for bus and subway programs, though details were not immediately available.</p>
        <p>The aides said the agreement was expected to call for spending at least $36 billion on mass transit over the next six years, close to the amount sought by New York officials. If approved, the agreement will lead to a significant increase in Federal transit spending in New York and around the country.</p>
        <p>Advocates of mass transit hailed today's deal on the tax-free transit benefits, saying it would encourage more employers to provide such benefits, and would sharply lower commuting costs for hundreds of thousands of people and cause a surge in transit ridership across the region.</p>
        <p>''This is a big deal for the region,'' said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders advocacy group. ''This is a major fare cut for a very large number of people.''</p>
        <p>Though the tax-free benefit, known as Transitchek in the New York region, has been available for years, it has not caught on much because of quirks in the law, Congressional officials said. Currently, 7,000 companies and 150,000 workers participate -- numbers that transit advocates expect to double or triple with the new changes.</p>
        <p>Under current tax law, companies can offer an employee up to $65 a month in Transitcheks, which are vouchers that can be redeemed for transit rides. But the law allows the benefit to be offered only on top of existing wages and benefits, forcing employees to negotiate higher salaries to receive it. That has discouraged not just individual workers, but also labor unions from asking for the benefit, the advocates say.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, employers will be able to remove $65 a month from a worker's existing pretax salary and give it to them as transit passes that are not subject to Federal, state or local taxes.</p>
        <p>The arrangement not only cuts a worker's transit expenses but also benefits employers: their payroll costs will be reduced because they will not have to pay Social Security, unemployment or other taxes on the $65. The plan calls for increasing the benefit to $100 per month starting in 2002.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who championed the bill in Congress, said the plan would save the average commuter $600 a year by 2002. ''It will make mass transit a more attractive mode of commuting and help reduce road congestion at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Russianoff said he thought the savings from the plan -- which he said could range from 25 cents to 60 cents per ride for a typical New Yorker -- would encourage more people to buy the monthly unlimited-ride passes that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to begin offering in July. Those passes will cost $63; with Transitchek, the cost would fall to $45 or less, he said.</p>
        <p>The battle over the environmental amendments was expected to last well into the night and threatened to hold up passage of the overall transportation bill. The tactic of attaching anti-environmental provisions to big-spending bills just before they are sent to the White House has been used repeatedly in recent years to avoid contentious debate, sometimes successfully.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solomon's amendment would delay the dredging of toxic chemicals like PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been linked to cancer, from any river in the nation for 18 months, while the National Academy of Sciences completes a study on the benefits of such dredging.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solomon has said he opposes dredging in the Hudson or Housatonic because he is concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to dump the PCB-contaminated soil among the dairy farms of his district. ''My entire farming community is at risk,'' he wrote in a letter to Representative Bud Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican who is a lead negotiator on the transportation bill.</p>
        <p>But word of Mr. Solomon's amendment has generated a storm of opposition from the Clinton Administration, several New York Congressmen and state legislators, raising doubts about whether it will survive in the final bill.</p>
        <p>''This is the strongest attempt yet to get G.E. off the hook, in terms of the damage it has done to the Northeast,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat who represents Queens and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Another amendment, offered by Representative Bob Wise, a Democrat of West Virginia, would block the E.P.A. from carrying out a policy intended to cut emissions of smog that drifts across state lines, causing air pollution problems in Northeastern states that are downwind from power plants and other pollution sources in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Yet another would stop the agency from issuing new regulations on pollution that is emitted from some outdoor paints as they dry. And a third would delay the E.P.A.'s efforts under the Clean Air Act to get some states where the air meets health standards to take further action to control pollution that cuts visibility in parks and wilderness areas.</p>
