        <p>In tones trembling with hurt, the people on the folding chairs in the municipal gymnasium were trading indignant charges over the  referendum on Friday on the Northern Ireland peace settlement.</p>
        <p>Then the quiet and steady voice of Anne Slaine, a white-haired woman in a lilac dress, rose from the front row, and the room fell silent.</p>
        <p>''I take a very simplistic view of life,'' she said, ''and I would like to think I could live as an equal to my Catholic neighbor and live in peace and concord and happiness with them all. I, however, am the mother of a young man who was literally cut in two by a rocket which went through his car, injuring him and killing a female colleague.''</p>
        <p>She paused and smoothed her lap. ''He is a victim and has to live with that the rest of his life,'' she said. ''I have to watch him. I watch him going about the floor on his bottom using his arms to propel him, and it's a painful situation for me. His children, their friends are afraid of him because of how he looks.''</p>
        <p>''I would like the situation in Ireland very much to change,'' she concluded, ''but if I vote yes, am I betraying him and everything he believes in?''</p>
        <p>In this typical Northern Ireland  town, her comment typified the wariness of change, the fear of betraying family and communal loyalties and the resentful feelings of victimization that have left the majority Protestant population of Ulster reluctant to approve the peace settlement that they must vote on this Friday.</p>
        <p>The respectful silence lasted only a moment before the invective that passes for debate in this bitterly divided province resumed. God was freely recruited by all sides to validate the bitter comments, with supporting scripture from Romans, Leviticus and Deuteronomy.</p>
        <p>A young Protestant woman named the son of a Catholic man on the other side of the hall as the murderer of her father. Ministers from the hard-line Free Presbyterian Church said that the peace settlement was ''ungodly'' and that Christian forgiveness did not apply to terrorist crimes. A heavyset man behind Mrs. Slaine growled that the promised prisoner releases would simply put back on the street ''the godfathers of massacres.''</p>
        <p>Dungannon, a County Tyrone hill town of beef and dairy farmers, small-business men and steep streets in the precise geographical middle of Northern Ireland, is sometimes slighted as ''the dead center'' of the province.</p>
        <p>Never a spot on fashionable itineraries, Tyrone and its neighboring county represented the enduring nature of the Irish conflict as long ago as the aftermath of World War I, when Winston Churchill warned that  ''as the deluge subsides and the waters fall short, we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again.''</p>
        <p>In spring, the valleys, forests and bogs below Lough Neagh sprout yellow gorse, plants that some have seen as symbolic this year of the choice facing Northern Ireland. The clumps are welcome for binding the sandy soil but treacherous to the touch with their thorny leaves.</p>
        <p>Built as a headquarters for Celtic chieftains -- the word dun means fort -- Dungannon divides its population of 9,500 evenly between Catholics and Protestants and boasts the first local government to have ever distributed power between the two communities. Under an arrangement followed since 1988, Catholics and Protestants swap the city council leadership every six months.</p>
        <p>Though their streets and buildings do not bear the tribal graffiti and flags and militaristic wall murals that demarcate neighborhoods in Belfast, the citizens of Dungannon still live largely segregated lives.  Catholics drink in Macleers on the Donaghmore Road, Protestants in Halliday's on Church Street.</p>
        <p>The security barriers that mark all the entrance roads to the town recall its history of sectarian bombings and killings that in the 1970's earned the area bounded by Dungannon, Armagh and Portadown the name the ''Murder Triangle.''</p>
        <p>The gathering in the gym of people from the mutually suspicious Catholic and Protestant communities, a rare occurrence in the North, was sponsored by BBC Radio Ulster for a call-in show with an unintentionally appropriate name for the conversational bent of this region. It's called ''Talk Back.''</p>
        <p>''You don't discuss politics here with your neighbors,'' said the Rev.  Denis Faul, 65, the headmaster of St. Patrick's Academy, where he has taught for 40 years.</p>
        <p>''Catholics here wouldn't talk to Protestants about that unless you'd be wanting to start a riot.'' Like most Catholics, he is for the agreement. ''I like it and I'll vote for it,'' he said, ''but I have my doubts about its future, knowing how deep the bigotry goes.''</p>
        <p>The agreement sets up a new Northern Ireland Assembly and two other consultative bodies aimed at balancing the desire of Protestants to reaffirm their status as British and the longing of Catholics to pursue the goal of unity with the Republic of Ireland to the south.</p>
        <p>The burden of trying to move long-held extreme positions in from the fringes toward the center has now shifted from the negotiators of the accord to the 1.2 million voters of Northern Ireland, and the culture among the long-dominant Protestants of stubborn resistance to any tampering with tradition is not yielding easily.</p>
        <p>A grimly complicating factor is the body count of more than 3,200 people killed in the conflict since 1969. Almost every person in Northern Ireland has suffered the loss of a relative or close friend, and the memories figure poignantly in the process of making up minds.</p>
        <p>In addition, people are reacting to the fierce feelings of community loyalty that often bar the way to stepping across traditional cultural lines.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Brian Bower of the Church of Ireland said many of his parishioners wanted to vote yes but could not bring themselves to do so because of feelings of obligation to a neighbor who may have had a family member killed. He predicted that some people would deliberately ''spoil'' their ballots, allowing them to satisfy their commitment to voting without having to make a decision.</p>
        <p>In such a polarized place, self-protection comes before self-interest. Brian MacAuley, manager of the Dungannon Enterprise Center, said that the business sector ''desperately'' wanted the stability that a yes vote promises, but that businessmen  would ''steer clear'' of expressing any view on the vote.</p>
        <p>''You take a stance on politics here, and it reflects on your trade,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>From the rows of students in the bleachers came a voice decrying the ''negativism'' of those opposed to the settlement. ''I hear a lot of talk about killing, but what you dinosaurs are killing is our future,'' the young man said.</p>
        <p>It seemed by the end of the tumultuous hour that no one remembered Anne Slaine's quiet plea for guidance on how to reconcile her vote with the fate of her son Paul, the police officer maimed by an Irish Republican Army rocket seven years ago.</p>
        <p>Then a student in the navy blue school sweater of St. Patrick's spoke up.</p>
        <p>''I would like to address a comment to the lady in the front,'' he said softly. ''I understand how she thinks a yes vote will betray her son. But I ask her to consider the fact that a no vote might betray her grandsons.''</p>
