        <p>The House today passed two symbolic resolutions meant to keep the spotlight on investigations of President Clinton and to urge him to cooperate.</p>
        <p>The first resolution, which passed 259 to 157, calls on Mr. Clinton to release all documents relating to his claim of executive privilege, which he has used to keep top aides from being questioned by the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.</p>
        <p>The second, approved 342 to 69, urges the President to compel potential witnesses to cooperate with a House inquiry into campaign finance abuses. Many Democrats voted for the resolution, maintaining that it was largely pointless since Mr. Clinton had already urged people to cooperate with investigators.</p>
        <p>Using the resolutions to zero in on the President's behavior, Republicans depicted Mr. Clinton as lacking in honesty and integrity. And they accused him of impeding the progress of investigations on issues ranging from his relationship with a former White House intern to exports of satellite technology to China.</p>
        <p>''That's all we're asking here today -- that the President be honest with the American people about his use of executive privilege,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip.</p>
