        <p>THIS is a pick-up-the-pieces-and-get-on-with-your-life story. If it were a television pilot, the first scene would flash back four years, when a smart and ambitious New Jersey girl picks up the telephone to learn that her live-in lover of two and a half years, the  brilliant Le Bernardin chef Gilbert Le Coze, has had what his staff calls ''an accident.'' The young woman rushes to the hospital, but is too late. Mr. Le Coze, 49, is already dead of a heart attack. The woman, unemployed and 26, thinks her world has come to an end.</p>
        <p>Flash forward to May 1998. Our heroine, now barely 30, is the owner of Lot 61, an art-filled former truck garage in Chelsea -- a three-month-old bar and restaurant of the minute. She holds the party after the premiere of ''Godzilla,'' and the dinner after Giorgio Armani's April fashion show. She stands 6 feet 4 inches tall (in her three-inch green lizard-skin heels) and wears a gauzy leopard-skin dress made by her busboy. She looks good, gets good reviews and has a new boyfriend. Most important, she is doing what she has always wanted: running her own business, and presiding as hostess of her own party, six nights a week. The spirit of Mr. Le Coze, she believes, will always be with her.</p>

        <p>Flash forward to May 1998. Our heroine, now barely 30, is the owner of Lot 61, an art-filled former truck garage in Chelsea -- a three-month-old bar and restaurant of the minute. She holds the party after the premiere of ''Godzilla,'' and the dinner after Giorgio Armani's April fashion show. She stands 6 feet 4 inches tall (in her three-inch green lizard-skin heels) and wears a gauzy leopard-skin dress made by her busboy. She looks good, gets good reviews and has a new boyfriend. Most important, she is doing what she has always wanted: running her own business, and presiding as hostess of her own party, six nights a week. The spirit of Mr. Le Coze, she believes, will always be with her.</p>
        <p>''I'm a sitcom,'' Amy Sacco said.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday evening, Ms. Sacco took a few hours out over a selection of appetizers -- the ''hacked duck'' spring rolls were the most interesting -- to talk about the plot lines of her life. It was 8 P.M., and Lot 61 was dotted with twentyish types in black and taupe; Drew Carey of the television show was at a table by the bar. On a wall hung ''Chachi'' by the painter Sean Landers, which the artist swapped for a five-figure food and bar bill. Ms. Sacco sat in a corner keeping her eye on the staff, then frowned upward when a sudden hailstorm started to pound her new roof. ''I'm waiting to feel it on top of my head,'' Ms. Sacco said. ''That's my baby. The roof is my biggest baby.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sacco is at heart a businesswoman who likes a really good party -- a woman thrilled that her busboy-designer calls her ''his own personal Barbie doll,'' less thrilled when the salad is so salty she takes it off the menu. She works from 11 A.M. to 2 A.M., and never liked school. But she did like restaurants.</p>
        <p>''She is extremely intelligent,'' said her best friend, Maguy Le Coze, the owner of Le Bernardin and the sister of Mr. Le Coze. ''It's not something that everybody has. What can I tell you? She likes what she's doing so much, it's almost like she's breathing through what she has chosen to do. She cannot speak about something else right now.''</p>
        <p>THE crucial character in Ms. Sacco's life is her mother, Bette, known for her baked ziti dinners for the Chatham High School basketball team. (Ms. Sacco's father owned a moving company.) Ms. Sacco was the youngest of 8, and her mother never had fewer than 12 at her table. ''There was always room for someone extra,'' Ms. Sacco said. ''People loved coming to our house. Because my mother was just great. If someone had a problem, they would call my mother.''</p>
        <p>Naturally the pomme does not fall far from the tree. Mom was the neighborhood hostess in suburban Chatham; her daughter grows up to be the neighborhood hostess among the art galleries of Chelsea. ''Being a manager is like being a mother anyway,'' Ms. Sacco said. Of course this is the late 1990's, and daughter gets investors who put in $1.2 million. But that is getting ahead of the story.</p>
        <p>''She was an unusual child,'' Mrs. Sacco said. ''Highly spirited, very precocious. She was always annoyed with small-town stuff. She always said she was going to go someplace, and be somebody.''</p>
        <p>Amy Sacco was very soon towering over the boys in her high school class, and heading across the Hudson, midweek, to the New York clubs. Area and Palladium were favorites. And her mother knew?</p>
        <p>''As if,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sacco worked after school at New Jersey restaurants -- she sliced scallions at the Tarragon Tree -- then went to Johnson and Wales, a restaurant school in Providence, R.I. When she graduated in 1990, she got a job through a friend at Bouley, the epicenter at the time of the New York food world. After that she was manager of the Lipstick Cafe and the restaurant Vong. She met Mr. Le Coze through friends at Bouley.</p>
        <p>After his death, she got a job managing the Monkey Bar, then running System, a discotheque. ''It was very glamorous,'' she said dryly. ''Go to work at 8 P.M., dress in plastic, come home at 6 in the morning.'' Ms. Sacco then went to work for a venture capital firm as a marketing consultant. One of her jobs was to get Swiss Army sunglasses and knives into the movie ''Armageddon.'' It was partly through the venture capital firm, and  restaurant friends, that she found her investors, whom she described as ''your average business guys.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sacco had a party for her investors in December -- ''300 suits,'' she calls them -- and was horrified when she arrived that day to find three inches of water all over her 5,500 square feet of floor. ''I got out three or four dry-vacs and took out my whip,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A bittersweet moment was opening night, without Mr. Le Coze. ''It was the achievement of my life, the fact that I got this place off the ground,'' she said. ''And not to have my biggest mentor in the world there to share it with me was devastating.'' And yet, she said, ''he would have been devastated if I'd shut down my life.''  PUBLIC LIVES</p>
