        <p>THE cast-iron building at 1 Bond Street offered up a good-sized mine of gold after a watchmaker moved out in 1892. For many years afterward, however, Bond Street was not a golden address. But the street is coming back after long decades of neglect, and the co-op at 1 Bond is beginning to make repairs ignored in its conversion a decade ago.</p>
        <p>In the 1820's and 30's, elite families built big town houses on Bleecker, Bond and other side streets off Broadway, among them what is now the Merchant's House Museum at 29 East Fourth Street. But by the 1850's fashion swept uptown along Fifth Avenue, and businesses moved in.</p>
        <p>In 1871 Robbins &amp; Appleton, a watch company, demolished the old row houses at 1 to 5 Bond Street for a new six-story headquarters and factory. Designed by Stephen D. Hatch, the new $45,000 building went up at the peak of the fashion for cast-iron, with French-style mansard roofs. A clock was set in a round dormer in the center, and the 1875 guidebook ''New York Illustrated'' indicated that the building was painted ornamentally, with gold leaf and red details against a background of neutral color.</p>
        <p>In 1874 Brooks Brothers built a red brick store across the street, at the northeast corner of Bond and Broadway, and ''New York Illustrated'' promised a ''kaleidoscopic scene'' with shoppers ''representing every state and country, every style of dress.''</p>
        <p>In March 1877 a fire destroyed the Robbins &amp; Appleton building. Thousands gathered on the streets as safes crashed through the floors, to be cooled by streams of water and recovered the next morning. The entire building, along with a sidewalk clock, was destroyed, and in 1879 the company called back Hatch to rebuild, at a cost of $120,000.</p>
        <p>Hatch reworked his original into a milder design, still with high mansards and a central clock face, but smoother, more modern. Robbins &amp; Appleton stayed in the building until 1892, when the firm moved downtown to Maiden Lane. But it retained a salvage company to perform an unusual salvage operation.</p>
        <p>The company had been processing $300,000 a year in gold for watch cases and recapturing $1,000 a month by saving the mats, wash water and even towels used by the workers. After the move, The New York Times reported that ''every stick of wood in the building'' was taken out and burned, with the ash processed through a chemical wash to reclaim more than $65,000 in gold.</p>
        <p>In 1896, the watch firm sold the building to Albert Friedlander, a cloak maker. Garment companies were moving to the area as retailers headed farther north, and garment businesses remained in the neighborhood for many decades. In 1970 typical tenants at 1 Bond Street were Glamour Wear and Sunflower Casuals. Harry Feigenbaum, a coffin maker, was across the street in 2 Bond, an old row house.</p>
        <p>In 1976, as 1 Bond was welcoming artists as residential tenants, Jim Evanson, an architect and furniture designer, saw a newspaper advertisement for a loft in the building; he rented an entire floor, 7,500 square feet, for $1,000 a month.</p>
        <p>MR. EVANSON remembered that the area was lively during business hours but ''at night everything closed down -- the only place to eat was only open during the day.''</p>
        <p>Josh Pickard, owner of Time Cafe at Lafayette and Great Jones Street, said that a development group began a co-op conversion at 1 Bond Street in 1989. A bank took over after financial problems and completed the conversion soon after. Most floors were cut up into apartments -- there are now 18 units -- but repairs to the facade, foundation and roof were not addressed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickard, the co-op president, said the shareholders collectively put in more than $7,000 a month over the regular maintenance charges.</p>
        <p>Recent projects include installation of a new roof; future ones are to include removing the iron shutters and repairing the facade, where rusty brown water drips from many nooks and crannies.</p>
        <p>''It's just getting to be where it should have been at the end of the conversion,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A big plus, he added, is that an investor, Henry Chiu, bought the ground-floor retail space last year. The store had been empty for a decade. After substantial repairs to the space and the basement, the Art Store, which deals in art supplies, moved in last year.</p>
        <p>The street is full of activity. Wet Seal, a clothing company, occupies the ground floor of the old Brooks Brothers building. Bond 07, an accessories store, is at 7 Bond Street. Loft conversions are also under way farther east.</p>
        <p>Bond Street has several things in its favor for future growth: its interesting architecture, the width of the street, a full run of cobblestones, and relatively light traffic.</p>
        <p>Most of the co-op's to-do list is nuts-and-bolts: emergency lighting, windows and the like. But there is one nonfunctional goal Mr. Pickard hopes to accomplish, even though he says his fellow shareholders are not as interested.</p>
        <p>In the center of the mansard, in the round dormer, which has been empty for at least 60 years, he would like to install a small reminder of Robbins &amp; Appleton: a clock.</p>
