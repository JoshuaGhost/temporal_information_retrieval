        <p>SHOULD Atlantic City resemble Las Vegas in any way?</p>
        <p>Nicholas L. Ribis thinks not.</p>
        <p>Many gambling industry analysts and executives, as well as New Jersey politicians, hope a new generation of Las Vegas-style mega-resorts will enhance Atlantic City's appeal as a tourist destination. But Mr. Ribis, president and chief executive of Trump Hotels and Resorts (Donald Trump is chairman), thinks the city has it backwards.</p>
        <p>''Atlantic City will never be Las Vegas! Never!'' Mr. Ribis said in a telephone interview from his Manhattan office, where he oversees the three Trump casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Gary, Ind. ''There is no way we should let outsiders, or uninformed politicians, tell us what to do.''</p>
        <p>And this from a New Jerseyan who says he voted against legalized gambling in 1976. The year before, Mr. Ribis, a Brooklyn-born lawyer practicing in Morristown, had tried a case here. ''The city was in a desperate condition, but its condition was no worse than other New Jersey cities, like Camden and Newark,'' he said. ''I believed that instead of saving one city, we should try to save them all, and I didn't think there was any kind of magic bullet, least of all gambling, that would save these cities, and I still don't. Gambling has been more successful in Atlantic City beyond anyone's dreams, but the problems the industry has had with uncertainty from government haven't gone away.''</p>
        <p>Those problems, Mr. Ribis said, included the state Department of Environmental Protection's 1997 refusal to permit the Trump Taj Mahal casino to open a Rainforest Cafe on a pedestrian walkway over the Boardwalk. The stated reason was that the restaurant would have interfered with pedestrian access to a still unbuilt portion of Steel Pier.</p>
        <p>''We would have had a volcano up there erupting, too,'' Mr. Ribis said, referring to the landmark in front of Stephen A. Wynn's Mirage Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>But ''the Atlantic City market is vibrant,'' he added. ''The casinos in Atlantic City are doing very well. Atlantic City still makes more money than the entire Las Vegas strip, and the Strip is where they have all these new mega-resorts are that are supposed to transform Atlantic City. Transform Atlantic City into what? Another Las Vegas? Who needs Las Vegas?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ribis made similar statements this month at a gaming industry symposium sponsored by Rutgers University. He took umbrage at remarks made by Don Snyder, president of the Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming Corporation, who dismissed Atlantic City's casinos as out of date, compared to newer Las Vegas facilities. (Mr. Snyder's company has wanted to build a Las Vegas-style casino in Atlantic City since 1996.)</p>
        <p>With a payroll of 15,500 full-time workers at the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza, Mr. Ribis heads Atlantic City's largest employer. For five years, the Taj Mahal has posted the highest gambling revenues in Atlantic City, averaging up to $2 million a day.</p>
        <p>Although gamblers continue to lose money there, the Trump casinos have had difficulty holding on to it. Mr. Ribis cited instances when a few high-rolling gamblers won unusually large amounts and added that the $17.6 million loss posted by Trump Hotels for the first quarter of 1998 was due mainly to high interest rates on the Trump casinos' debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ribis would not comment on the fact that Trump Hotels has contracted with brokers to sell all three of its casinos here. He would not say why the properties were for sale or if buyers had been found.</p>
        <p>Nor did he mention that highly decorated style of Las Vegas-style casinos have some appeal with Atlantic City's gamblers. In 1997, Hilton Hotels opened its Wild Wild West casino at Bally's Park Place on the Boardwalk. The casino, which features a robotic gold prospector, electric trains and a simulated desert thunderstorm every half-hour, raised Bally's gambling revenues by 39 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ribis said he had no plans for building new casinos or expanding here. ''We're satisfied with what we have,'' he said. ''We've reduced our operating costs, and we're cutting back on giveaways. We found out that less than 40 percent of the people who gamble and would want to visit Atlantic City have yet to come here. So we're going to market more to them.''</p>
