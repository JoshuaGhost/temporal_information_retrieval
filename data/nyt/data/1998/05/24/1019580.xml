        <p>Incident involving New York Yankee pitcher Graeme Lloyd, who swung bat at Baltimore Orioles pitcher Armando Benitez after Benitez set off brawl by hitting Yankee Tino Martinez with pitch has set off debate about protocol of a pitcher's throwing at a batter after another batter hits home run (M)</p>

        <p>Before Gene Budig suspended Armando Benitez last week for hitting Tino Martinez with as purposeful a pitch as a pitcher can throw, he consulted members of his staff. The newest member of the American League president's staff is Bob Gibson.</p>
        <p>Neither Budig nor Gibson would disclose their conversation, but it would have been worth the price of two box seats to have been able to eavesdrop. Here's a league president about to take action against a pitcher for hitting a batter, and he seeks advice from the pitcher who epitomized pitching ''mean.''</p>
        <p>''I think the myth was a lot better than what happened,'' Gibson said of his reputation. ''It sounds good. If I had known I had the image when I pitched, I would have been better off. I think because I was black I was the big, bad bear. I threw inside, but that's the way everybody pitched. But nobody knew me that well because I didn't talk to people.''</p>
        <p>Gibson, a Hall of Fame pitcher whose demeanor intimidated people on and off the field, acknowledged that he knocked down hitters -- not necessarily hitting them -- for two reasons. ''They knocked Brock and Flood down constantly,'' he said, recalling two of his celebrated St. Louis teammates. ''The other reason was the guy hit me pretty well and it was to loosen him up. I hit a lot of guys trying to come inside, but 90 percent of the guys I hit I wasn't trying to.''</p>
        <p>Gibson was one of a group of former players who were surveyed about the protocol of a pitcher's throwing at a batter after another batter hit a home run. Once upon a time, it seems, the practice was fairly common.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't routine, but it definitely happened more often,'' Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench coach, recalled. ''I always thought it was stupid. I got hit. Hodges hit a home run in the upper deck and Jeffcoat hit me in the face.''</p>
        <p>Phil Garner recalled that he was a target, too, at a time ''when it used to happen all the time.''</p>
        <p>''When I played in Pittsburgh,'' the Milwaukee manager related, ''Stargell would hit a home run, Parker, Bill Robinson and Mike Easler hit home runs, and they drilled me. I could never understand that until later. The conclusion I came to was it was kind of an unwritten law in baseball that you protect the bigger guys and the ones who weren't the stars took the hit.''</p>
        <p>Contrary to the view of most people asked, Garner saw a strain of logic to hitting someone after a home run, pointing out that it was the pitcher's mistake that led to the home run being hit in the first place. ''The pitcher says that guy hit my mistake but I'm going to drill somebody,'' he said. ''You won't know who's going to get drilled. That puts the opposition on edge. Hitters who can be intimidated will be intimidated. It doesn't matter who you hit. It matters that you did and the other team knows you will.''</p>
        <p>Dave Stewart, now the San Diego pitching coach, said there might be reasons for purposely throwing close to a hitter, but a home run slugged by a previous batter is not one of them.</p>
        <p>''I believe that if you catch a hitter cheating then maybe you might want to come in a  little tight,'' he explained. ''If you have a guy at second who's relaying signals to the guy at home plate or if a guy's leaning out across the plate and hitting a pitch that's a good pitch, then maybe you have to come in on the hitter.'' But, Stewart added, referring to Benitez: ''There's no reason for what he did, in my opinion. I never did it when I played. If a pitcher leaves a pitch out there that's supposed to be hit, there's no reason to take it out on the next guy. You can't punish a guy for a mistake you make.''</p>
        <p>A pitcher who was a 20-game winner four years in a row, Stewart said he doesn't allow his pitchers with the Padres to throw at hitters to retaliate for their mistakes. ''I believe in protecting my hitters,'' he said. ''If they're being knocked down, I'll protect my hitters. But if my pitchers make a mistake, they have to suffer the consequences for the mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Stewart said that as a young fan in the San Francisco Bay area, he watched Gibson and Don Drysdale pitch inside to Willie McCovey.  ''Gibson and Drysdale were mean and they pitched inside, period,'' Stewart said. ''But they didn't do that. Now guys don't pitch inside generally and then they knock down a guy if he hits a home run. If you're going to be mean, be mean all the time.''</p>
        <p>Gibson offered two thoughts that clearly come from a pitcher. ''Most of the time,'' he said, ''when a guy gets hit, it's his fault. You don't usually hit a guy if he's paying attention.'' And, he added: ''Nobody complains if you miss by a foot outside. If you miss like that inside, they say you're throwing at the guy.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes pitchers don't make any pretense about their intentions. Garner related one tale involving a pitcher who contrary to his off-field demeanor was a mean pitcher.</p>
        <p>''Nolan Ryan and I were the closest of friends,'' Garner recalled. ''There was a time I thought we would never face each other again. I got a hit against him and I said, 'I want you to remember that the last time I faced you I got a base hit.' ''</p>
        <p>As Garner's luck would have it, he wound up with the Dodgers when Ryan was with Houston, and with Ryan pitching, Tommy Lasorda sent Garner to the plate as a pinch-hitter. ''The first pitch was at my chin,'' Garner recounted. ''The next one I fouled off, and then he threw one behind my ear at 99 miles an hour. I wound up on my rear.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this season, Budig suspended Randy Johnson for throwing two pitches over Kenny Lofton's head. The first, Gibson noted, was a breaking ball. If a pitcher intends to hit or knock down a batter, he throws a fastball. Which is exactly what Johnson did after Lofton angrily complained about the first pitch.</p>
        <p>''I would have done exactly the same thing, make no mistake about it,'' said Gibson, who had not yet been hired by the American League.</p>
        <p>McGwire Passes Ruth</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire is only one-third of the way toward breaking Roger Maris's home run record, but when he whacked three home runs last Tuesday, he passed Babe Ruth for the first time.</p>
        <p>Ruth, in his career, averaged 1 home run every 11.76 times at bat, the best ratio ever. Coming into this season, McGwire had hit 1 every 11.94 at-bats. But when he was finished with his three-homer night, the St. Louis first baseman had reduced that ratio to 1 every 11.69. After he connected for Nos. 22 and 23 in his first three at-bats last night against the San Francisco Giants, McGwire was at 1 for every 11.63. For the season, he was averaging 1 home run every 6.43 at-bats.</p>
        <p>Piazza's Choice</p>
        <p>Several general managers have privately expressed the view that Mike Piazza made a major mistake in rejecting the Los Angeles Dodgers' contract offer earlier this season.  Most reports have put the offer at six years for between $80 million and $85 million, but Dan Lozano, the catcher's agent, said he has yet to see the accurate dollar figure reported. He declined to provide the right number but seemed to be suggesting that it was lower than the reported figures.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Piazza was very likely worth more to the Dodgers than he will be to another team, including the Mets. If he were a good defensive catcher, he might be able to get $13 million or so a year, but he's mediocre at best. As a first baseman or a designated hitter, even an outfielder, he would be attractive as a hitter, but $13 million attractive? Those general managers don't think so.</p>
        <p>Calm Reigns in National League</p>
        <p>Gene Budig, the American League president, can't buy a break. Incidents in his league, the latest the brawl between the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles, prompt rulings that often produce controversy. Budig's National League counterpart, Len Coleman, meanwhile, goes about his noncontroversial business, the latest being his attendance Friday night in Cincinnati where the Reds retired Frank Robinson's No. 20.</p>
        <p>The Reds' story itself has turned positive in the absence of Marge Schott, the managing partner on enforced leave. John Allen, who had been the team's controller, has operated the Reds for nearly two years, and he has taken such positive steps as honoring former stars, such as Robinson, and filling a previously all-white front office with black executives.</p>
        <p>Under Allen, the Reds have hired Darrell (Doc) Rodgers as assistant general manager, Muzzy Jackson as player development director, De Jon Watson as scouting director and Anthony Ward as controller.</p>
        <p>''I think John Allen has done a tremendous job in very difficult circumstances,'' Coleman said. ''On a scale of 1 to 10, he's been a 10. Clearly he's made very strong efforts to diversify the Reds' front office and I commend him.''</p>
