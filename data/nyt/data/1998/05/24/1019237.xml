        <p>SOMEWHERE toward the middle of the CD version of Spalding Gray's monologue, ''It's a Slippery Slope,'' his autobiographical narrative about birth, death and the transcendental joys of skiing, Mr. Gray's richly nuanced voice is joined by the sound of shoes striding across the pavement during an anxiety-ridden walk in Washington Square Park. When the narrator is confronted by a drug dealer who casually asks him, ''Hey, man, what's happening?,'' the footsteps come to a halt. ''Hey,'' Mr. Gray responds with the mocking irony of a man who senses that his whole life is about to change, ''Good question: what is happening?''</p>
        <p>It's one of the many moments in ''It's a Slippery Slope,'' which was released last week, where sound and words are combined to form a kind of sonic subtext to Mr. Gray's tragi-comic meditations. ''Cosmically, on the deepest level, is there anybody who knows what's going on?,'' Mr. Gray reflected recently over a breakfast of hot cereal, coffee and fruit in a diner near his SoHo loft. ''I always thought that was a very profound question. It's more internal than external. The footsteps are in the mind.''</p>

        <p>SOMEWHERE toward the middle of the CD version of Spalding Gray's monologue, ''It's a Slippery Slope,'' his autobiographical narrative about birth, death and the transcendental joys of skiing, Mr. Gray's richly nuanced voice is joined by the sound of shoes striding across the pavement during an anxiety-ridden walk in Washington Square Park. When the narrator is confronted by a drug dealer who casually asks him, ''Hey, man, what's happening?,'' the footsteps come to a halt. ''Hey,'' Mr. Gray responds with the mocking irony of a man who senses that his whole life is about to change, ''Good question: what is happening?''</p>
        <p>It's one of the many moments in ''It's a Slippery Slope,'' which was released last week, where sound and words are combined to form a kind of sonic subtext to Mr. Gray's tragi-comic meditations. ''Cosmically, on the deepest level, is there anybody who knows what's going on?,'' Mr. Gray reflected recently over a breakfast of hot cereal, coffee and fruit in a diner near his SoHo loft. ''I always thought that was a very profound question. It's more internal than external. The footsteps are in the mind.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gray and James Taylor, the singer-songwriter who produced the CD, the challenge of making a studio recording from one of Mr. Gray's monologues, which are usually performed in front of a live audience, presented a world of audio possibilities, not the least of which was exploring the ways in which the spoken word can mimic the structure and dynamics of music.</p>
        <p>''At a certain point, a monologue becomes a form of heightened conversation, a kind of jingle, and the rhythms of that jingle come through the repetition of speech,'' said Mr. Gray. ''It's a lyrical space that I think approaches music, and I think James was aware of that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor agrees. ''He definitely takes spoken prose to another level,'' the producer said. ''It was remarkable listening to him make decisions about how to deliver it, how much energy to put into it, the pacing and the timing of it, and how, as it rises and falls, the actual rhythm and cadence changes.''</p>
        <p>The sense of ''It's a Slippery Slope'' as a kind of chamber piece for voice is heightened by snippets of Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony, which frame the monologue and are used evoke the exhilaration of flying down a snow-covered slope. The 73-minute recording is also peppered with ambient effects ranging from the shushing of downhill skis to airport lobby noises, ringing bells and slamming doors, many of which were culled from radio sound-effects records.</p>
        <p>''Spalding really wanted to use some sound effects to illustrate the piece,'' said Mr. Taylor, who used ice clinking in a glass to foreshadow Mr. Grays free-fall plunge into what the writer describes as fear without an object.</p>
        <p>''In the movie 'Taxi Driver,' there's a scene where Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster are sitting in a diner, and he puts some Alka-Seltzer in a glass and there's the sound of bubbles and suddenly you're taken from a rather close-up shot into an intense close-up of the bubbles in the seltzer, and it's too close, too tactile and immediate,'' said Mr. Taylor. ''And the fact that you're hearing this in the context of New York City tells you that the guy's nerves are on edge. It's an interesting device to me, and I wanted to find something like that.''</p>
        <p>''It's a Slippery Slope'' was recorded over the course of a week last fall in a rented house not far from Mr. Taylor's home on Martha's Vineyard, with the assistance of John Morrison, a sound engineer who had worked with Mr. Taylor on his album, ''Hourglass.''</p>
        <p>''It was a gas,'' said Mr. Morrison, who also helped shape the sound on a digital editing system in New York after the initial takes of the piece were done. ''They are both really sharp people with really broad interests. It was pretty relaxed in the beginning, then we all started to feel the pressure of the deadline approaching.''</p>
        <p>The remote setting contributed to the intense, almost confessional mood of the recording. ''One of the things I most like about it is the range of immediate intimacy, as though Spalding is about an inch from your ear, or maybe an inch inside your ear,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''Then at other times he's yelling at you from the top of a mountain and you're at the bottom.''</p>
        <p>The project was an excursion into new creative terrain for both men. Mr. Taylor had never produced a project involving the spoken word; Mr. Gray had never recorded a monologue with split-second timing and audio manipulation made possible by state-of-the-art digital equipment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor and Mr. Gray also connected on a more personal level. ''At first, I simply couldn't imagine James wanting to do this,'' Mr. Gray recalled. ''I couldnt figure it out. But then, as I began to know more about his life, I realized that this particular monologue to him was about surviving and coping and going through dark passages. And in Martha's Vineyard, while we were waiting for the recording equipment to be set up, he really opened up and told me his monologue, his life story.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor confirmed this feeling of empathy. ''I think there's a connection between the place I write from and the place Spalding writes from,'' said the singer, who in recent years has overcome addiction and the deaths of several friends and relatives. ''I think we have that in common, writing about ourselves and our own experience.''</p>
        <p>TO convey the sense of open space and action, ''It's a Slippery Slope'' cuts back and forth between the studio recording and the extroverted energy of a live performance. ''I was bitching and moaning that I had to go in the middle of the recording session to Pittsburgh and do a one-night stand,'' Mr. Gray recalled. ''And James suggested that we do a digital recording and listen to it and see if we could integrate it into the studio version. And it worked because the live stuff glitters -- it has the outside glitter of heightened reality, which I think is a good metaphor.''</p>
        <p>Yet the most impressive effect in ''It's a Slippery Slope'' is Mr. Gray's own voice, which in the course of the story modulates from a hushed whisper to staccato exclamations and echoing outcries of angst. There are also passages where Mr. Gray shows off his virtuoso skills as a comedic actor and mimic like when he does his impression of listening to a Walkman tape of Peter Coyote reading from the book, ''Zen Mind, Beginners Mind,'' with the batteries running low, his voice slowing down and dropping several octaves as the tape grinds to a halt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray said that he came away from the project with a newfound respect for the art -- and rigors -- of audio engineering. ''I never realized how hard it is to make something sound natural,'' he said. He is also pleased that, despite its high-tech touches, ''It's a Slippery Slope'' derives its power from the poetic possibilities of the human voice.</p>
        <p>''It's the best rendition of this monologue I can think of,'' he said. ''That's one of the most important things about my work: that it gains weight from its own energy, without lots of embellishment. And that, in this day and age, people can sit still and listen without going out of their minds. Because, in the end, it's the sound of one man talking.''</p>
