        <p>In the polyglot of communities in and around Los Angeles, ethnic heritage, more than class, can determine whether cash gifts are offered.</p>
        <p>Jill Stroope, a partner in Elegant Solutions, a wedding consultancy in Irvine, Calif., said that at most weddings of 200 guests in Southern California, just five or six of the 100 gifts are checks. That won't hold, however, at a wedding she is planning for a Chinese bride and a Vietnamese groom.</p>

        <p>In the polyglot of communities in and around Los Angeles, ethnic heritage, more than class, can determine whether cash gifts are offered.</p>
        <p>Jill Stroope, a partner in Elegant Solutions, a wedding consultancy in Irvine, Calif., said that at most weddings of 200 guests in Southern California, just five or six of the 100 gifts are checks. That won't hold, however, at a wedding she is planning for a Chinese bride and a Vietnamese groom.</p>
        <p>''The groom's mother told me no one in the family will be eating during the dinner,'' Ms. Stroope said. ''They will be roaming the room collecting cash.''</p>
        <p>But at Hispanic events like weddings and quinceaneras, the family coming-of-age party for 15-year-old girls, gifts are still preferred over cash.</p>
        <p>''I only give gifts,'' said Roseanne Vargas, 42, assistant director of a preschool in San Bernardino. ''The only time there is money given, dollars are pinned on the bride.''</p>
        <p>At a traditional Armenian wedding last month in Glendale, the bride and groom were showered, literally, with money by their guests, who carpeted the dance floor with $2,000.</p>
        <p>''It's extra generosity,'' said the bride, Judy K. Badami, 38, an executive at the Original Jack's Baking Company, her father's bakery in Pico Rivera. Besides the money dance, she and her husband, Ted, received cash gifts that averaged $200. ''Armenians would rather give money,'' Ms. Badami said.</p>
        <p>Leah Seider, a neuro-psychologist in Malibu, typically gives $100 when she and her husband, Dennis, attend events.</p>
        <p>''It changes depending on how important the occasions are,'' she said. ''It depends on my relationship with the person. If I don't know why I was invited, I give $75.''</p>
        <p>At the bat mitzvah last year of Ms. Seider's daughter, Sara, adults typically gave $100 a couple. Sara received $10,000 in cash gifts; 10 percent was given to charity and the rest put away for college.</p>
        <p>Relatives gave Albert L. Kaschalk, 32, about 10 cash gifts in the $100 range after he graduated this month from the University of Southern California with a master's degree in business administration.</p>
        <p>''You want to make sure it's not a token,'' he said, assessing his relatives' reasoning. ''It takes that to do something special.''</p>
