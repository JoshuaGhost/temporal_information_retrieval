        <p>From Dublin on the Irish Sea to rocky Connemara and Galway Bay in the west, from Cork in the south to Dundalk near the border with Northern Ireland, people in the Irish Republic congratulated themselves and their northern neighbors today on their overwhelming vote for the Northern Ireland peace agreement in Friday's referendum.</p>
        <p>''It's a great day for Ireland,'' words repeated over and over across this country of 3.5 million, became an instant and joyous national cliche, reflecting as well satisfaction that the agreement was convincingly approved in a separate referendum in the British province.</p>
        <p>''There's not going to be dancing in the streets,'' said Lucy McKeever, an official of the Abbey Theater, after buying a head of lettuce in the Temple Bar section, the center of night-life cafes in downtown Dublin. ''But it's as if everybody is of one mind for once.''</p>
        <p>She said the vote was a message to the Irish Republican Army, which for 30 years has used guerrilla warfare to try to force Britain out of the North, that ''we have moved on, and violence is not the way.'' She noted that the voters had approved the abandonment of the Republic's constitutional claim to sovereignty in the North.</p>
        <p>Michael Simonds, the owner of a bookstore in the suburban town of Dalkey, said of the vote: ''It's fantastic. It shows that the vast majority wants peace.''</p>
        <p>The official count showed that 94 percent of the voters approved the agreement, with a turnout of 56 percent of the eligible electorate -- lower than in referendums in recent years on divorce and abortion. Officials attributed the relatively low  turnout to a widespread conviction that the accord would pass easily..</p>
        <p>The pact promises the Roman Catholic minority in the North greater political power and is intended to give the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Everyone called the results historic, and most said it promised hope for a lasting peace in the British province, where more than 3,200 people have been killed in 30 years of sectarian warfare. ''It's a great day for Ireland,'' people repeated.</p>
        <p>The first public official to say it, on an early morning radio program, was Mary O'Rourke, a legislator representing Longford, County Westmeath, whose family has had members in Parliament for decades. ''It's also a great day for democracy,'' she added.</p>
        <p>She noted that voters had agreed to abolish the constitutional claim to sovereignty in the North, which remained British when southern Ireland gained independence, after a bloody rebellion, in 1922. The abolition of the claim was the Irish Republic's greatest concession in the current settlement.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Rourke's party, Fianna Fail, only approved it after Prime Minister Bertie Ahern persuaded dissidents to agree. Every major party in Ireland also advocated a ''yes'' vote.</p>
        <p>But she acknowledged, with other Irish officials and experts, that the vote was only a first step toward lasting peace, and that many obstacles remained.</p>
        <p>Attention is now focused on the June 25 election for a new Northern Ireland assembly. The group will have no authority to deal with three of the major problems: the release of paramilitary prisoners; the disarmament of the I.R.A. and Protestant paramilitaries, and the reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the predominantly Protestant police force in the North.</p>
        <p>Work on these issues will be done by Mr. Ahern's Government and Britain, which sponsored the talks that led to the new peace agreement.</p>
        <p>Fergus Finlay, a former senior official in the Irish Foreign Affairs Department who spent four years negotiating with the British Government on the North, said of the vote: ''It's beyond people's wildest expectations. There's a new way of doing things. They've built a new platform.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, the first dangerous test will come at the end of June, the season for Protestant parades in the North. These marches have sparked violence in recent years.</p>
        <p>Irish Republic voters also approved, by a smaller majority, a European Union document dealing mostly with administrative procedures. A strong campaign was waged against the document, the Amsterdam Treaty, by people who said it would lead to the end of Irish military neutrality.</p>
        <p>But there was little popular interest in that treaty today. And many people seemed to share the shadow of doubt expressed by Mr. Simonds, the bookstore owner, who said of the peace agreement, ''I hope it works.''</p>
