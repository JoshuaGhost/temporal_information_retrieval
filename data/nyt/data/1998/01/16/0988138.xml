        <p>'Japanese Theater in the World'  Japan Society  333 East 47th Street  Through Feb. 1</p>
        <p>Japanese theater is as great as theater gets. In its myriad forms, it is exactly the kind of ''total art'' that Richard Wagner dreamed of. And this exhibition, organized by the Japan Foundation and the Tsubouchi Theater Museum of Waseda University in Tokyo, is an attempt to document both the history of the medium in Japan and its impact on the West.</p>
        <p>The project is, to say the very least, ambitious, and the result is less a visual essay than a densely packed assemblage of some 700 objects -- masks and costumes, stage models and musical instruments, woodblock prints and contemporary posters -- tucked into every nook and cranny of the Japan Society's wrap-around gallery space.</p>
        <p>This kind of full-immersion approach is always daunting, leaving organizational logic -- in this case, by chronology and genre -- hard to discern. But forget the navigational challenges; just take the plunge and go with what catches the eye.</p>
        <p>The path leads through sections devoted to the rarified austerities of Noh theater and to the dark-edged satires of Kyogen, past a 13th-century mask of a gold-skinned Buddha and one of the smiling sun goddess Amaterasu, for whom, legendarily, theater was invented. Everywhere forms seamlessly blend: flowers painted on a folding screen carry over onto costumes, costumes tailored to human actors reappear on Bunraku puppets and in prints.</p>
        <p>The selection of contemporary graphic works created for Japan's avante-garde theater is particularly arresting. Many of these poster images, from the 1960's on, look like fantastic, special-effects performance pieces created for the camera. (Surely contemporary artists like Mariko Mori and Yasumasa Morimura have found inspiration here.)</p>
        <p>Given the dynamism of the Japanese theater tradition, it is little wonder that it has had an impact, however cosmetic, on the West: in the form, for example, of Yeats's Noh plays, or popular dramas with Japanese settings (Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' is represented here by early costume designs from the Metropolitan Opera), or in stagings that adopt Japanese conventions, as in a recent production in Munich of Richard Strauss's ''Frau Ohne Schatten.''</p>
        <p>But it is for Japanese theater itself that one visits this show. Whether you want to recapture hours spent at the Grand Kabuki in Tokyo or simply indulge an appetite for the perfections of Japanese visual culture, a visit to Japan Society over the next two weeks will be amply repaid.</p>
