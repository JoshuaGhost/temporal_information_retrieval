        <p>Tessa Traeger and Margaret Courtney-Clarke  Witkin Gallery  415 West Broadway, near Spring Street  SoHo  Through Jan. 24</p>
        <p>Both Tessa Traeger and Margaret Courtney-Clarke journeyed to far-flung places to produce their photographs, but only Ms. Courtney-Clarke came back with pictures that transcend familiar conventions of on-location photography. Ms. Traeger, a successful British food photographer, went to a village in the Ardeche region of France, where she made portraits of the natives holding traditional foods and other products in their work-worn hands. The prints are medium-large and nicely made but suffocated by cliched piety about Old World people and pre-modern traditions.</p>

        <p>Tessa Traeger and Margaret Courtney-Clarke  Witkin Gallery  415 West Broadway, near Spring Street  SoHo  Through Jan. 24</p>
        <p>Both Tessa Traeger and Margaret Courtney-Clarke journeyed to far-flung places to produce their photographs, but only Ms. Courtney-Clarke came back with pictures that transcend familiar conventions of on-location photography. Ms. Traeger, a successful British food photographer, went to a village in the Ardeche region of France, where she made portraits of the natives holding traditional foods and other products in their work-worn hands. The prints are medium-large and nicely made but suffocated by cliched piety about Old World people and pre-modern traditions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Courtney-Clarke's views of deserts, on the other hand, veer off from the usual expectations. For one thing, she makes tiny rather than breathtakingly expansive prints. Many are the size and shape of an elongated postage stamp. In these, the concentration of color (or, in black-and-white prints, of values) yields compelling, nearly abstract compositions: ''Deep Sand,'' for example, sandwiches a glimpse of purple mountains between saturated ocher sand and a cloud-streaked slate blue sky.</p>
        <p>The miniaturization also creates a magical, microcosmic quality. In a set of pictures of abandoned house interiors flooded by sand, she captures a luminous mystery that calls to mind the paintings of Rene Magritte.</p>
