        <p>With the Israeli Government taking a tougher stand on Middle East peace, Arab leaders are making clear their hope that President Clinton will use a meeting in Washington next week to take unparalleled steps to persuade Israel to change course.</p>
        <p>In private conversations, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in particular has become increasingly blunt, according to Western diplomats, in saying that Washington must turn up the heat on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel if it does not want the quest for a broader peace to collapse altogether.</p>
        <p>And even in public, the usually circumspect Syrian leader has suggested that the position on any broader peace with the Palestinians that was adopted this week by the Israeli Government should have demonstrated even to Mr. Netanyahu's supporters in Washington that he has no real commitment to peace.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that the Arabs are not the ones who kill peace and the peace process, but the Israelis,'' Mr. Assad said here late Wednesday night after an unexpected meeting with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. ''The whole world knows and says that the Arabs cling fast to the peace process; others do not.''</p>
        <p>The Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, has publicly warned that the situation has become so fragile that the peace effort is in danger of disintegration unless American intervention next week can produce some kind of confidence-building reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Noting that the Clinton Administration has voiced disappointment at the position taken by the Israeli Government, some prominent Syrians have even suggested in interviews that the meeting next week should serve as an occasion for Washington to use financial pressure.</p>
        <p>They hope that Mr. Clinton will threaten to withhold some of the $3 billion in military and economic aid that is provided by the United States to Israel each year unless Israel shows a willingness to reconsider its peace stands.</p>
        <p>The talks here between Mr. Assad and Mr. Mubarak, which were announced only as they began, were the clearest sign of a widening Arab alarm over the new Israeli stand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Assad's spokesman, Jubran Kourieh, said today that the main focus of the talks had been ''the peace process and the dangerous situation it reached because of the negative attitude of the Israeli Government.''</p>
        <p>The meeting scheduled for next Tuesday between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu is to be followed by another on Thursday between the President and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>The sessions have been widely expected to focus on the perilous relations between Israel and the Palestinians. But in private meetings in Damascus with American members of Congress and other visitors in recent days, Mr. Assad has also suggested that Mr. Clinton use his time with Mr. Netanyahu to try to salvage negotiations between Israel and Syria, which have not held peace talks at all since Mr. Netanyahu took office 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu has refused to resume talks under a framework worked out between Syrian negotiators and his Labor Party predecessors, which would have seen Israel withdraw fully from the Golan Heights in return for security assurances and a full peace.</p>
        <p>The hard line that Mr. Netanyahu has taken in his separate talks with the Syrians has left Mr. Assad to publicly despair of the prospect that peace talks with Syria could ever be restarted while Mr. Netanyahu remains in office. In the past, the Syrian Government has consistently disparaged Mr. Arafat for his decision to make a separate peace with Israel, and until now Damascus has insisted that it will now take its own steps toward any peace with Israel without respect to what happens between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>But the sympathy felt across the Arab world for Mr. Arafat in the face of Mr. Netanyahu's treatment of him is now resonating so deeply in Syria that one Western diplomat said, ''It is an open question at this point whether Assad would engage now in the absence of real progress on the Palestinian track.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, diplomats say Syrian officials are bristling over the neglect shown by Washington toward the Israeli-Syrian track over the last year as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the American special envoy, Dennis B. Ross, have devoted the bulk of their efforts in the Middle East toward trying to salvage prospects of a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The diplomats said that Mr. Assad told a visiting American Congressional delegation last week that next week's meeting should serve as an occasion for Mr. Clinton to urge Mr. Netanyahu to be more open to the prospect of resuming talks with the Syrians in a way consistent with the conditional assurance provided by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as early as July 1994.</p>
        <p>It was at that time, American and Israeli officials have said, that Mr. Rabin told Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Israel would be willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights to the lines that were in place before the 1967 war in return for security assurances and the full normalization of relations between the two countries.</p>
        <p>That assurance was the basis of talks between Syria and Israel that reached their peak at the Wye Plantation, a conference center in Maryland, in early 1996. The talks were halted after a series of bombings in Israel.</p>
