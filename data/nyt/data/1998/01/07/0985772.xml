        <p>de MENIL-Dominique. Dominique de Menil was a great friend and a constant source of hope and courage for the Children's Storefront School in Harlem. She understood what we do and her infinite compassion and practical ways of dealing with oppression were visionary and kind. The children, the head master, Ned O'Gorman, and the Trustees owe her so much. We will find the world less filled with light now that she is gone. We send love to her children who have brought, as their mother did, their love and their support to this school.</p>
