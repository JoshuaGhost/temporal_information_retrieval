        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''To Masters of Language, a Long Overdue Toast'' (Education page, Dec. 31), about a tribute to the late Francis E. Sommer, who supposedly spoke 94 languages, does not distinguish between linguists and polyglots.</p>
        <p>A linguist is a student of linguistics, the scientific study of language. A polyglot knows many languages. Linguists are not necessarily polyglots, nor is the reverse true. The competence of linguists is not measured by the number of languages they know.</p>
        <p>The article uses words like fluent, learn and master. But when do those words apply? When a person can order a meal in a restaurant? Explain how a computer works? Write poetry? Achieve something even higher?</p>
        <p>The saying ''Jack of all trades, master of none'' applies here. The more languages one ''knows,'' the less well one can know of each. ''Mastering'' a language means knowing everything there is to know about it as well as understanding, speaking and writing it to perfection. Under that definition, no one has mastered even one language.</p>
