        <p>Bond prices ended higher for the fourth straight session yesterday, pushing yields further into record-low territory and inducing more corporate borrowers to sell debt.</p>
        <p>Although the appetite for bonds was not as hearty as on Monday, investors were still motivated to buy on resilient speculation that the Federal Reserve's next adjustment of interest-rate policy might be down. Lower rates tend to enhance the value of bonds already in circulation.</p>
        <p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed up 9/32, to a price of 105 25/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.72 percent, beating the record low of 5.74 percent set on Monday.</p>
        <p>Long-term prices initially fell but rallied in the late afternoon after corporate debt sales were met with good demand, a sign that the broader pressures pushing up bond prices have not peaked. Securities dealers who had sold long-term Treasuries ahead of the uncertainty over those corporate sales bought them back.</p>
        <p>''The initial selling came from large hedge funds,'' said Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. He also attributed some of the early selling to dealers who were taking profits from the recent rally on ''perhaps a feeling that the bond market had overshot reality.''</p>
        <p>Among the $2 billion of corporate debt priced was International Business Machines' $700 million of 30-year debentures through Merrill Lynch, yielding 6.5 percent, about 79 basis points above the Government's long bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Following are results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills:</p>
