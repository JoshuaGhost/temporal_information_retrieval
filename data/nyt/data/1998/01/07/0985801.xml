Here is his: he was born in Poughkeepsie, raised in Millerton, got his MA. from Albany, did graduate work at Columbia, wrote a TV quiz show, taught English and Journalism in Smithtown for 27 years, did newspaper work including writing a weekly column with a delicious sense of humor. He loved music, books, acrostics, and most of all his family. According to his wishes there was no funeral. Instead there will be a celebration of his life on his birthday, May 23. Survived and loved by Mindy, Mark, Nina, Jim, &amp; Zachary; also Vivian, Bob and family; and all the former pupils whose lives he touched.</p>
