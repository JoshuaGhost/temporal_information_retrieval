        <p>EVENTS  Glittering History</p>
        <p>OAKLAND, Calif. -- If you had been in Sutter's Mill, Calif., 150 years ago on Saturday, you could have been in on the start of something big. That was the day gold was discovered, touching off the great California Gold Rush. On Saturday, that event will be commemorated with the opening of ''Gold Fever! The Lure and Legacy of the California Gold Rush'' at the Oakland Museum of California. The show includes more than 1,000 artifacts, interactive exhibits, paintings, photographs, a reconstructed archeological dig and more. It runs until July 26. Information: (888) 625-6873.</p>

        <p>Past as Prelude</p>
        <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A three-year, nine-city tour of the United States and Japan opens on Saturday at the Mint Museum, where ''20th-Century Still-Life Paintings From the Phillips Collection'' begins at 10-week run. At its heart, this exhibition of 72 works illustrates the evolution of 19th-century tradition in 20th-century still-life paintings by artists like Pierre Bonnard, Rufino Tamayo, Man Ray, Walt Kuhn and Walter Sickert. The broad spectrum of Cubist paintings in the show includes works by Georges Braque, Picasso, Stuart Davis, Bradley Walker Tomlin and John Graham. Midcentury art is represented in works by Georges Rouault, Milton Avery, Morris Graves, Ben Shahn, Giorgio Morandi and Ben Nicholson. Among other artists in the show are Henri Rousseau, represented by ''The Pink Candle,'' and Georgia O'Keeffe, represented by ''Large Dark Red Leaves on White.'' Information: (704) 337-2000.</p>
        <p>Remembrance</p>
        <p>What could be a more appropriate celebration of George Balanchine than to observe his birthday with new dance? Balanchine was born Jan. 22, 1904, and on Thursday the company of which he was a founder will once again observe the date with world premieres. That night at the New York State Theater, in keeping with plans for Balanchine birthday observances announced last year, the New York City Ballet will present the first public performance of ''Variations on a Nursery Song,'' by Richard Tanner, and ''Concerti Armonici,'' by Peter Martins, the company's artistic director. Information: (212) 870-5570.</p>
        <p>Family Ties</p>
        <p>CHADDS FORD, Pa. -- Grandfather and grandson never met. Yet their art shares elements of mystery, romance and drama. The grandfather is N. C. Wyeth, who died in 1945. The grandson is Jamie Wyeth, who was born in 1946. Beginning on Saturday, their work will be the subject of a comparative exhibition, ''N. C. Wyeth and His Grandson: A Legacy,'' at the Brandywine River Museum. The elder Wyeth, whose paintings illustrated classic tales of adventure and romance, will be represented by many of his finest works, for such books as ''The Mysterious Island'' and ''Rip Van Winkle.'' His grandson Jamie, whose father is the artist Andrew Wyeth, is known for his portraiture, images of everyday scenes and illustrations for children's books. Among his paintings in the show are ''Meteor Shower'' and ''Portrait of a Pig.'' The show runs until March 29. Information: (610) 388-2700.</p>
