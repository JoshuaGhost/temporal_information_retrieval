        <p>A trans-Atlantic partnership captured the prestigious Cap Gemini World Top Pairs in The Hague yesterday. Zia Mahmood, the Pakistani star who lives in Manhattan but is usually somewhere else, was playing with the top-ranked British player, Tony Forrester. They held a big lead at the start of the final session but were challenged by two Italians, Andrea Buratti and Massimo Lanzarotti. The margin was 13 victory points with one match remaining to be played, but Zia and Forrester held on to win by 21.</p>
        <p>The final standings were: first, Zia and Forrester, 857; second, Buratti and Lanzarotti, 836; third, Tor Helness and Geir Helgemo, of Norway, 815. The highest-ranked Americans were David Berkowitz, of Old Tappan, N.J., and Larry Cohen, of Boca Raton, Fla., who were sixth, with 785.</p>

        <p>A trans-Atlantic partnership captured the prestigious Cap Gemini World Top Pairs in The Hague yesterday. Zia Mahmood, the Pakistani star who lives in Manhattan but is usually somewhere else, was playing with the top-ranked British player, Tony Forrester. They held a big lead at the start of the final session but were challenged by two Italians, Andrea Buratti and Massimo Lanzarotti. The margin was 13 victory points with one match remaining to be played, but Zia and Forrester held on to win by 21.</p>
        <p>The final standings were: first, Zia and Forrester, 857; second, Buratti and Lanzarotti, 836; third, Tor Helness and Geir Helgemo, of Norway, 815. The highest-ranked Americans were David Berkowitz, of Old Tappan, N.J., and Larry Cohen, of Boca Raton, Fla., who were sixth, with 785.</p>
        <p>Cohen and Berkowitz sat North-South on the dynamic deal shown in the diagram, with another American pair, Eric Rodwell and Jeff Meckstroth in the East-West seats. North's two-club opening was natural. South was eventually doubled in five hearts, a contract that would make an overtrick with normal breaks. The lead of the spade nine was ''reverse suit-preference,'' asking for a club return. South ruffed and avoided the trap of attempting to draw trumps. He carefully led a diamond. East won and led a trump, taken by the ace.</p>
        <p>Now Cohen should have ruffed a diamond, ruffed a spade, and repeated the process. Drawing trumps would then have squeezed East and produced an overtrick. Instead he led a club, giving West a chance to ruff. If he had done so, South would have had no trouble. But West discarded, and the club king won in dummy.</p>
        <p>Cohen ruffed a spade, ruffed a diamond, ruffed a spade and ruffed one more diamond. Now he was in the wrong hand, with nothing but clubs in the dummy. He led to the queen, and West was able to ruff. But he had no more diamonds, and whether he led a spade or a trump, South could use his last trump to squeeze East in the minor suits.</p>
        <p>South made his contract, breathing hard, and gained 13 imps. East-West were left to regret that they had not continued to five spades, a contract that succeeded at other tables.</p>
