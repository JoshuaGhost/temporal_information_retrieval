        <p>The clouds parted for the teen-agers on opening day at the Australian Open, where 16-year-old Lleyton Hewitt caused the host nation's first case of heartbreak and 15-year-old Mirjana Lucic of Croatia dealt Australia a second blow by overpowering Rennae Stubbs,  7-5, 6-1.</p>
        <p>Hewitt won two weeks ago at Adelaide to become the ATP Tour's third-youngest champion. Today, he wore his white cap rally-style throughout his first career five-setter, but fell short of wearing down the 54th-ranked Daniel Vacek and lost, 6-2, 6-4, 1-6, 2-6, 6-3.</p>

        <p>The clouds parted for the teen-agers on opening day at the Australian Open, where 16-year-old Lleyton Hewitt caused the host nation's first case of heartbreak and 15-year-old Mirjana Lucic of Croatia dealt Australia a second blow by overpowering Rennae Stubbs,  7-5, 6-1.</p>
        <p>Hewitt won two weeks ago at Adelaide to become the ATP Tour's third-youngest champion. Today, he wore his white cap rally-style throughout his first career five-setter, but fell short of wearing down the 54th-ranked Daniel Vacek and lost, 6-2, 6-4, 1-6, 2-6, 6-3.</p>
        <p>''Going into the fifth set I was pretty confident, but he played a tough fifth set,'' Hewitt said. ''You've just got to sort of grind-and-guts the match out. It wasn't like I got killed out there.''</p>
        <p>The first seeded player to be deposed was No. 12 Sabine Appelmans of Belgium, who fell prey to a spirited 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 comeback by Natasha Zvereva of Belarus. Other seeded players fared better. Fourth-seeded Iva Majoli beat Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan, 6-4, 6-2, and will face Lucic, a fellow Croat, in the second round. Conchita Martinez of Spain, seeded eighth, scored an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 victory over Sandra Kloesel of Germany, while 15th-seeded Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania downed Meike Babel of Germany, 6-2, 6-1.</p>
        <p>On the men's side, sixth-seeded Petr Korda, the Czech veteran, defeated Albert Portas of Spain, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, while fourth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden beat Allen Belobrajdic of Australia, 2-6, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1. Alex Corretja of Spain, seeded 11th, downed Lucas Arnold of Argentina, 6-4, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3.</p>
