        <p>An off-duty police officer opened fire on two men who were attacking him in a residential neighborhood in Brooklyn yesterday afternoon, shooting one man in the leg, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man shot in the leg was taken to Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition. The other man was not injured but was arrested, Officer Valerie St. Rose, a police spokeswoman, said.</p>
        <p>The officer was taken to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center. The officer, whose name was not immediately released, was suffering from trauma and minor injuries, Officer St. Rose said.</p>
        <p>The attack occurred at 4:10 P.M. outside 277 Schaefer Street in the Bushwick section, not far from the Cemetery of the Evergreens, the police said. Few details of the incident were available last night, but Officer St. Rose said the two men apparently used a cane to attack the officer.</p>
