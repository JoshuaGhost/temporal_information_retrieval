        <p>In surprisingly harsh tones, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran criticized the United States tonight for oppressing the people of Iran and vowed that they would never be enslaved again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami's attack on the United States came in the middle of a televised hourlong sermon delivered to thousands gathered at the tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of Iran's revolution, who died in 1989.</p>
        <p>The crowds were gathered in a poor neighborhood in southern Teheran to pray through the night on the eve of one of the holiest days of Shiite Islam: The day marking the death of Ali, the son-in-law of the prophet Mohammed.</p>
        <p>It was not the time to be nice to America.</p>
        <p>''We are not at war with the world,'' Mr. Khatami said. ''But we will not give up our revolutionary principles. This glory was not gained easily, so it will not be given up easily. We have had enemies both before and after the revolution, the ones who damaged our freedom, independence, interests and glory. And most of this damage came from America's oppressive policies.''</p>
        <p>The crowd interrupted him by chanting ''Death to America'' several times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami's remarks about the United States were sharply different in tone from his recent public statements. At a news conference in December, he expressed respect for the American people and called the United States Government its legitimate representative. And in an interview earlier this month with C.N.N., he called for a dialogue with the American people through cultural exchanges, although he said there was no need for political ties.</p>
        <p>In that interview, Mr. Khatami also tried to explain the Iranian ritual cry of ''Death to America'' as a criticism not of the American people, but only of misguided policy makers.</p>
        <p>But in both the news conference and the interview, Mr. Khatami was reaching out to an American audience, and perhaps trying to elicit a positive gesture from Washington as well. But no gesture came.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Khatami, a cleric, has come under fire by a number of Iranian commentators who have mounted a campaign against him. They disparaged as signs of softness and distortions of the truth his remarks that the seizure of the American Embassy in 1979 ''hurt'' the American people, his disagreement with the ritual burning of the American flag and his praise for the founders of the United States.</p>
        <p>And in a sermon charged with rage last Friday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader and the highest authority in the country, ruled out any dialogue with the United States, branding the country ''the enemy of the Iranian nation.'</p>
        <p>Ayatollah Khamenei also denied suggestions from abroad and in the Iranian press that Mr. Khatami's remarks signaled that Iran may be moving toward a rapprochement with the United States, calling it a ''tricky propaganda'' intended to destroy the unity of Iran's revolution.</p>
        <p>President Khatami has often stated that it is Mr. Khamenei who has more authority in Iran. And in his sermon tonight, Mr. Khatami may have been trying to signal that whatever his personal views the unity of Iran's Islamic republic comes first.</p>
        <p>''Both before and after the revolution, American politicians acted toward the world as if they were the masters,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added that because Iran wanted to be independent, ''simply because it is not in line with America's interests, America gives itself the right to treat us in any way that it wants and to talk to us in any way that it wants.''</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Khatami said that American legislation that demands punitive sanctions on foreign companies that invest heavily in Iran proves that the United States wants to impose its will not only on Iran but on Europe and Asia as well.</p>
        <p>''They want to impose their own domestic law on the world,'' he said. ''The world will not tolerate a master any more -- not only will we not tolerate a master, neither will the world. The embargo has led America into isolation. America's politicians are betraying the American people.''</p>
