        <p>A man who beat a 66-year-old woman to death in 1992 after she let him into her Paterson apartment for a drink of water was convicted of murder yesterday, the Passaic County Prosecutor's office said.</p>
        <p>Samuel Rodriguez, who was 18 at the time, was arrested in 1993 when the mother of a woman with whom he shared an apartment recognized him on ''Paterson's Most Wanted,'' a cable television show patterned after ''America's Most Wanted,'' said Walter Dewey, an assistant prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dewey said the segment actually focused on a robbery Mr. Rodriguez later admitted to. ''The mother said, 'Hey, isn't that Sammy who lives with you?' '' Mr. Dewey said. ''And the girl said, 'Yeah, and he told me another thing: he killed that woman Granny, and that he was having bad dreams about it, that she came to him and asked, 'Why did you kill me?' ''</p>
        <p>Thomas Kaiser, Mr. Rodriguez's lawyer, said his client had not intended to kill Rebecca Thomas, known to neighbors as Granny. ''He was high on crack and he was looking for money for drugs,'' Mr. Kaiser said.</p>
