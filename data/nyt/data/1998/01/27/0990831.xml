        <p>Two major takeovers involving leading Canadian energy companies were announced yesterday, a reflection of the competitive pressures causing a consolidation among midsized businesses in the energy industry.</p>
        <p>The Union Pacific Resources Group, a major independent United States oil company, said it would buy Norcen Energy Resources Ltd., based in Calgary, Alberta, for $2.6 billion in cash and the assumption of  $900 million in debt.</p>
        <p>Union Pacific Resources had tried to acquire Pennzoil for $6.4 billion but abandoned the effort in November after Pennzoil management fiercely opposed such a deal.</p>
        <p>In addition, a major Calgary-based Canadian pipeline company, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., announced that it would acquire the Nova Corporation for stock valued at $4.91 billion.</p>
        <p>That deal would create the fourth-largest natural gas pipeline company in North America.</p>
        <p>Under the transaction, Nova shareholders will swap one common share for 0.52 share of TransCanada stock. TransCanada shares closed at $30.30 (Canadian), or $20.86 (United States), off 5 cents (Canadian), or 3 cents (United States) in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and Nova shares gained 20 cents (Canadian), or 13.7 cents (United States), to $15.05 (Canadian), or $10.36 (United States).</p>
        <p>The merged companies will be split into two units, one primarily a pipeline and the other a chemical manufacturer.</p>
        <p>The agreement by Union Pacific Resources to acquire Norcen at $13.65 a share, a 29 percent premium from its closing price on Friday, satisfies a long quest to find attractive properties, said Jack L. Messman, the chairman and chief executive of Union Pacific Resources.</p>
        <p>He said that with ''U.P.R.'s leadership position in the United States and Norcen's strong position in western Canada and Latin America, this combination will create a well-balanced North American Company.''</p>
        <p>Union Pacific Resources is one of the most aggressive and largest drilling companies in the United States and has been on the lookout to expand exploration possibilities.</p>
        <p>George Lindahl 3d, the president and chief operating officer of Union Pacific Resources, said the acquisition would give it ''new core areas in Canada and Latin America plus a significant strategic expansion in the Gulf of Mexico, including the deep water.''</p>
        <p>Most United States companies have been scrambling to buy leases in the deep water in the Gulf of Mexico, where large and profitable finds of oil and natural gas have been made in the last four years.</p>
        <p>Union Pacific Resources said it expected few changes in operations and that the Canadian business would keep its headquarters in Calgary. Its shares closed at $28.625, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Norcen stock jumped $4.15 (Canadian), or $2.86 (United States) to close at $19.45 (Canadian), or $13.39 (United States), leading active issues on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday. Norcen is 49.5 percent owned by the Toronto-based Noranda Inc., which has agreed to tender the stake to Union Pacific Resources.</p>
        <p>The drive to combine for TransCanada came from the deregulation of the natural gas markets.</p>
        <p>''The North American energy services industry is experiencing a wave of consolidation as companies position themselves for success in an increasingly competitive market,'' said George Watson, the president and chief executive of TransCanada. ''This merger will allow us to meet the challenge of this new environment.''</p>
        <p>J. E. Newall, the vice chairman and chief executive of Nova, said his company accepted the offer partly because the value of the company was not reflected in the stock price.</p>
        <p>The merged company will continue to be based in Calgary, with a combined work force of about 6,300 employees. Although some jobs will be eliminated through attrition, Mr. Newall said the company would seek to retain skilled workers, who have become scarce in Calgary.</p>
        <p>In another unfolding energy takeover, a bidding war seemed to be looming for a leading utility in Britain as the shares of the Energy Group soared yesterday after the company said it had received approaches from other utilities.</p>
        <p>Pacificorp, a major utility in the Western United States, had bid $9.7 billion for the the company, an offer that later lapsed. Pacificorp said it wanted to make another bid.</p>
        <p>Energy Group, Britain's largest electricity supplier and owner of Peabody Holding, the biggest United States coal company, said yesterday ''that its board has received approaches from parties other than Pacificcorp, which may or may not lead to an offer being made.''</p>
        <p>The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph said that among those that might have jumped into the bidding were Texas Utilities of Dallas. Texas Utilities declined to comment.</p>
