        <p>Times Square is in the midst of a spectacular rebound that has sent a flood of new business into the Broadway theaters. So when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced a new initiative that would give the theater owners tens of millions of dollars in new development rights, it did seem that once again the rich were getting richer.</p>
        <p>But Broadway is prey to boom and bust cycles. The theater owners have long complained that many of their landmarked buildings are uneconomical in all but the best of times. The Mayor's plan would allow them to sell what city officials say would be up to $100 million worth of air rights throughout a large chunk of the midtown area between Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue. The owners already have the power to sell development rights to adjoining buildings. Making those rights more portable could redirect that construction to more appropriate locations, like Eighth Avenue -- the dividing line between the theater district and the low-rise residential Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.</p>

        <p>Times Square is in the midst of a spectacular rebound that has sent a flood of new business into the Broadway theaters. So when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced a new initiative that would give the theater owners tens of millions of dollars in new development rights, it did seem that once again the rich were getting richer.</p>
        <p>But Broadway is prey to boom and bust cycles. The theater owners have long complained that many of their landmarked buildings are uneconomical in all but the best of times. The Mayor's plan would allow them to sell what city officials say would be up to $100 million worth of air rights throughout a large chunk of the midtown area between Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue. The owners already have the power to sell development rights to adjoining buildings. Making those rights more portable could redirect that construction to more appropriate locations, like Eighth Avenue -- the dividing line between the theater district and the low-rise residential Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Right now, Eighth Avenue's existing zoning leaves it vulnerable to badly planned growth. The city's new zoning proposal will allow the buildings to be even larger, but with enough safeguards the changes could actually improve the area's chances of avoiding sterile overdevelopment. Eighth Avenue's new face must be welcoming to the night life of the theater district, and a buffer that marks a transition between the commercial and residential neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The most ambitious part of Mr. Giuliani's initiative is aimed at revitalizing the cultural life of the theater district. Owners who sell their development rights would have to promise to keep their theaters well maintained and available only for theatrical productions. Twenty percent of the money from the sales would be funneled to the Broadway Initiative, a nonprofit organization that would make loans to producers of dramas and small musicals that are suitable to the least profitable theaters.</p>
        <p>Although the most laudable, this is also the shakiest part of the proposal, requiring an economic, political and cultural transformation far more dramatic than the rough outlines of the Mayor's plan seem likely to entail. The finances of the Broadway Initiative, like those zoning changes, will require close attention as the proposals make their way through the long approval process. Full acceptance of the plan must await those details. Still, the mix of initiatives and protections Mr. Giuliani has brewed together looks good in concept. The big prize the Mayor envisions is far from certain. But the chance is still worth taking.</p>
