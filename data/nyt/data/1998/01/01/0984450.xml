        <p>The State of New York is scrambling to reprogram a computer that improperly denied medical insurance to at least hundreds of welfare recipients last month, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The statewide computer system, which handles all welfare cases, mistakenly terminated Medicaid coverage for single adults on welfare who failed to comply with work requirements. A new state law, which took effect in November, prohibits counties from denying Medicaid to those people.</p>
        <p>But state officials failed to promptly reprogram the computer system, which has continued to deny medical benefits automatically. It was unclear yesterday how many people had lost their insurance, but a New York City official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated that hundreds of welfare recipients had lost Medicaid in the city alone.</p>
        <p>State health and welfare officials said the computer problem would be fixed within a week. They attributed the delay to the sheer magnitude of the changes now required under new state and Federal welfare laws.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of changes going on, and it takes time to make the computer changes,'' said Robert R. Hinckley, a spokesman for the State Department of Health.</p>
        <p>''But the bottom line,'' Mr. Hinckley said, ''is that any person who was taken off Medicaid will be put back on immediately. And we're going to talk to the local districts and see if we can manually review those cases to see if anybody did slip through the system.''</p>
        <p>Advocates for the poor have reported several glitches in the state's computer systems as officials comply with Federal rules that require, among other things, that the state deny food stamps and Medicaid to certain groups of immigrants and move welfare mothers into work activities.</p>
        <p>The people mistakenly denied Medicare are being punished for violating work rules and typically lose cash benefits for up to six months for refusing assignments or failing to show up for work. In the confusion, some people have been improperly denied their medical benefits.</p>
        <p>In Cattaraugus County, in the western part of the state, welfare workers have had to restore Medicaid benefits to each welfare recipient manually when the computer mistakenly cuts them off.</p>
        <p>''We have about 10 cases a month, so we've been able to catch them,'' said Wendy Bourgeois, the Commissioner of the Cattaraugus Department of Social Services. ''I can't imagine how a place as big as New York City would deal with this.''</p>
        <p>Renelda Higgins, a spokeswoman for New York City's social services agency, the Human Resources Administration, declined to comment. But advocates for the poor say that city officials have been unable to stop the computer system from automatically denying benefits to people like Vladimir Yirmeyahu, 36, who received a letter telling him he would lose his Medicaid this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yirmeyahu, a Russian immigrant who takes Prozac to ease his depression, was stunned and frightened.</p>
        <p>''I thought about very scary things, like hurting myself,'' said Mr. Yirmeyahu, who was penalized by the city for refusing to give up a computer training course to take a workfare assignment. ''Because, how can I live without my Medicaid?''</p>
        <p>He found a lawyer, however, who quickly demanded a state administrative hearing in his case. And he will continue to receive his benefits and insurance while he waits for a hearing.</p>
        <p>State welfare officials said that they believe few people have actually been denied treatment because of the computer error. But they are urging people like Mr. Yirmeyahu to notify their local social service agencies so their insurance can be restored.</p>
        <p>Advocates for the poor say that they fear that most welfare recipients will not question the termination of their medical benefits. And they say that officials should formally notify everyone who has been mistakenly denied Medicaid of the error and tell them how to restore their health coverage.</p>
        <p>''The shame of it all is that neither the city, nor the state, has made any effort to contact these people to provide them with an alternative method of coverage,'' said Marie-Elena Ruffo, a senior staff attorney at Bronx Legal Services.</p>
