        <p>To understand how much Penn State quarterback Mike McQueary will miss his favorite receiver in Thursday's Florida Citrus Bowl game against Florida, let McQueary put it in perspective.</p>
        <p>''We came in together, so I've thrown probably a million balls to him over the last four years,'' he said of wide receiver Joe Jurevicius, who caught 10 touchdown passes this season but is suspended for this game because of academic deficiencies.</p>
        <p>''We just know each other so well,'' McQueary said. ''You don't get that kind of timing overnight.''</p>
        <p>Joining Jurevicius on the sideline is another key offensive player: Curtis Enis, Penn State's leading rusher. Enis, who amassed 1,363 yards and 19 touchdowns, was banished from the team for accepting a gift from an agent. Enis, a junior, declared Monday that he would enter the 1998 National Football League draft.</p>
        <p>''Curtis is a big part of our football team,'' McQueary said. ''But he's gone now. Rather than sit around and harp on it, we have to get the job done without him, and we will.''</p>
        <p>Without Jurevicius and Enis, the offensive weight rests squarely on McQueary's shoulders. The Nittany Lions are trying to forget that he is a fifth-year senior who wrested the starting job only this season.</p>
        <p>Joe Paterno does not seem all that worried.</p>
        <p>''He's a great leader,'' the coach said of McQueary. ''And he's a much better passer than people give him credit for. He's a competitor.''</p>
        <p>Despite the loss of 29 touchdowns from Enis and Jurevicius, Paterno said Penn State would not make any significant changes for Florida.</p>
        <p>''You can't be cute like that,'' Paterno said. ''I made some changes one year, and we played a horrible bowl game. Besides, you destroy the confidence of your people. We have some young guys who are working hard and deserve the chance to do the things they know how to do.''</p>
        <p>Paterno had a good feeling about McQueary well before the redhead made him look good by completing 146 of 255 passes for 2,211 yards and 17 touchdowns this season.</p>
        <p>''Before the season, everybody was saying, 'Hey, how about McQueary?' '' Paterno said. ''I said, 'I'm not worried about McQueary. He's the least of my worries.' I worried about the offensive line, and that proved to be true.''</p>
        <p>McQueary's teammates seem to share Paterno's respect for their quarterback.</p>
        <p>''He sat around this place four years before he got a chance to really shine, and he took the best advantage of his chance,'' split end Chafie Fields said. ''The guy is a winner.''</p>
        <p>McQueary, who grew up literally in the shadow of Penn State's campus, said he never thought about transferring, even though his playing chances were virtually nil while Kerry Collins, now starting for the Carolina Cougars, controlled the job.</p>
        <p>McQueary is refreshingly candid about what he brings -- and doesn't bring -- to the Lions.</p>
        <p>''Nothing physically is outstanding about me, and I'd be the first one to tell you that,'' the 6-foot-4-inch, 222-pounder said. ''I don't have a rifle for an arm or I don't have the quickest feet. But I think my leadership and presence on the football field is what gets it done.</p>
        <p>''I'm capable of making the big play when I have to, but I'm not going to be so outstanding all the time that I'm going to be able to get away with my physical ability.''</p>
        <p>Penn State and Florida both come into this game at 9-2, but they have contrasting styles. The Nittany Lions are run oriented, and their team is honed in the crucible of the Big Ten Conference's physical play; the Gators emphasize the fleet receiver Jacquez Green and alternate quarterbacks Doug Johnson and Noah Brindise.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we're used to dealing with their kind of speed in the Big Ten,'' McQueary said. ''You can't run past them sideline to sideline. You've got to go north and south.''</p>
        <p>Paterno hinted that he might tinker with his defense.</p>
        <p>''You know what Winston Churchill said one time?'' the coach said when asked about possible defensive changes. ''He said, 'Secrecy is so important in war that it must be surrounded by lies.' Do you want me to tell a lie?''</p>
        <p>But Paterno is obviously comfortable with McQueary, who has become a striking example of what patience can do for a player.</p>
        <p>''Guys come in and if they're not playing right away, some tend to get upset,'' McQueary said. ''But if they look at a guy like myself who's been there and see what can happen in his fifth and final year, then maybe they'll say, 'Hey, give it a chance, because Mike did and it worked out for him.' ''</p>
        <p>And now McQueary is looking to finish off his fairy tale story in style.</p>
