        <p>THE three best meals I have had this year have all been at the same restaurant. Peacock Alley.</p>
        <p>Given that the year is less than a month old, that is not such a startling statement. But I'll go further: I do not expect to find many more-exciting meals this year. And I certainly do not expect to find better service.</p>
        <p>What is going on at the Waldorf-Astoria? Did the grand hotel suddenly realize that most of New York's four-star restaurants (Le Cirque 2000, Restaurant Daniel, Lespinasse and Jean Georges) are in hotels? Did management decide that the Waldorf should also aspire to greatness? Perhaps, for when the talented Laurent Manrique left Peacock Alley to open Gertrude's, the hotel went shopping for a truly great chef.</p>
        <p>They found one in France. Laurent Gras, 32, was chef de cuisine at Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo and at Alain Ducasse in Paris. After a dozen years in the shadow of Mr. Ducasse, he was ready to set off on his own. He must have been intrigued, too, by the challenge of trying to fill a perennially empty restaurant. But Mr. Gras bided his time. Arriving in New York at the end of summer, he did not introduce his new menu until mid-November.</p>
        <p>It was worth the wait. His first menu was filled with luxuries intended to display the chef's pedigree and the restaurant's commitment to extravagance. The menu's special white truffle section offered opulent dishes like stewed cepes topped with white truffles and an ornate hare royale made with wild Scottish hare, foie gras, Cognac and more white truffles. To prove that the restaurant was buying nothing but the best, the maitre d'hotel paraded around the dining room with truffles as large as grapefruits perfuming the air.</p>
        <p>When the white truffle season ended, Mr. Gras began using black truffles with equal abandon. They are strewn across oven-baked scallops; sea bass with endives is practically buried in black. Other luxuries abound. Mr. Gras roasts a whole foie gras and serves it in a Port reduction. He showers seared tuna in caviar, embellishing this creation with a light and elegant cream of cauliflower.</p>
        <p>But this lavish menu seems more the hotel's declaration of intent than a personal statement by Mr. Gras, who has no need of flashy foods. His simplest preparations are equally imposing. To eat his salad, a mixture of seaweed and tiny greens surrounded by lightly caramelized root vegetables, is to gain new insight into the world of vegetables. Little bits of lemon pulp dance around the plate, making each bite distinct and delicious.</p>
        <p>Wild turbot is simply baked and served with sauteed prawns and pale green, translucent seaweed from Brittany. Eating it, you can almost feel the ocean breeze caressing your face. Squab, on the other hand, is absolutely of the earth, anchored by a sauce made of three kinds of lentils.</p>
        <p>Unlike many modern chefs, Mr. Gras does not try to dazzle you with exotic ingredients, and no Asian accents find their way into his food. His most spectacular dishes rely on combinations that are unexpected and absolutely right. He thickens his lobster soup with roasted chestnuts, giving it a sweet richness. When the waiter ladles the soup over the artfully arranged sea urchins and crab meat, the scent alone is enough to make you dizzy.</p>
        <p>Dover sole has a Jura wine sauce that is so subtle and forceful the fish takes on an entirely new character. Embellished with tiny mushrooms and a mascarpone-enriched polenta, it is an unforgettable dish. Langoustines luxuriate in a vanilla-scented Chardonnay sauce, as sweet and rich as dessert.</p>
        <p>Desserts, on the other hand, are not dependent on sweetness. Each offers a fascinating interplay of flavor and texture. A citrus tart is tempered by chocolate and a mandarin orange sorbet. Pretty lemon balm soup is served with quince sorbet. A caramelized apple is surrounded by three apple confections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gras has certainly brought the food at Peacock Alley to a new level. But he has done more than that: he has invigorated the staff with a new sense of purpose. From the maitre d'hotel to the busboys, everyone seems energized by the food and intent on providing an extraordinary experience. This kind of care is sometimes found in the best restaurants of France, but it is almost unknown in New York.</p>
        <p>The Waldorf-Astoria still has some work if it intends to compete with the four-star establishments. The cheese cart is not up to the standard of the rest of the menu. The wine list is improving, but it is badly in need of some affordable bottles. The main impediment, however, is the dining room itself. Although it is comfortable and quiet, it has very little character. And the harp music, which some people love, will never attract a younger crowd.</p>
        <p>But the main question is this: Can Mr. Gras, and Peacock Alley, maintain their high standard? What will happen when New York wakes up to the fact that one of its oldest restaurants has been entirely reinvented?</p>
