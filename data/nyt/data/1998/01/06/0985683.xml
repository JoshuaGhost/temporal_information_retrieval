        <p>The first signs were bullish. The Dow Jones industrial average crept above 8,000 points early yesterday after European markets rallied overnight. Financial and technology stocks soared.</p>
        <p>But before the day was over, investors were treated to another variation on what could become the theme of the year: Will or won't the Asian economic crisis take a bite out of one of the greatest bull markets in history?</p>
        <p>The struggle between stock optimists and pessimists is not about whether a slowdown looms for corporate earnings; it is about about how much earnings growth will slow. Yesterday, victory went to the optimists, albeit just barely.</p>
        <p>After an early rally carried the Dow average 70 points higher, heavy selling around midday pulled the blue-chip index 50 points lower, before it finally edged up to 7,978.99, a gain of 13.95 points in heavy trading.</p>
        <p>Broader stock indexes were equally volatile. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, strong early in the day, finished up just 2.03 points, to 977.07. The Nasdaq composite index, up as much as 21 points in early trading, closed up 12.59 points, to 1,594.12.</p>
        <p>Yet the earnings debate, as evidenced by yesterday's seesaw trading session, goes on. Some stock analysts say the slowdown will be muted by a healthy American economy, while others insist that weakening profits will eventually dismantle a record-setting three-year sprint.</p>
        <p>The evidence would seem to be stacked against bullish investors. Largely because of the crisis in Asia, Wall Street strategists have tempered their forecasts, and analysts have trimmed earnings estimates.</p>
        <p>History also suggests a slowdown is coming. For a record three consecutive years, the Dow average has risen 20 percent or more annually. The end of 1997 also marked the best 10-year period on record for the Dow. In the 1990's alone, the Dow is up 191 percent.</p>
        <p>Even more, the economy is well into its seventh year of expansion, and although wage pressures have begun to rise, inflation has not.</p>
        <p>This kind of economy, some stock analysts say, is inevitably followed by a slowdown and weaker share prices. But while many analysts are expecting a year of modest stock returns of, say, 5 percent to 8 percent, at least one stock researcher sees gains of up to 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, said the bull market had been powered by a period of incredibly stable inflation, creating an economy and stock market quite different from those in earlier periods.</p>
        <p>Much of the credit, he said, goes to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has been a vigilant inflation fighter.</p>
        <p>''You have to remember, the last 18 years are probably the first 18 years in history where the Federal Reserve was intent on killing inflation,'' Mr. Bernstein said yesterday. ''And nothing kills the value of financial assets more vehemently than inflation.''</p>
        <p>Although the gains of recent decades are unusual, he said, they are exactly what should be expected in a noninflationary economy. One reason is that to bolster profits, corporations have had to overhaul themselves or increase productivity since they cannot easily raise prices.</p>
        <p>For those reasons, the current economy and stock market do not easily yield to historical statistics. ''The economy is fundamentally different than it was 25 years ago,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''Yet you don't have the universal acceptance that this is a different period.''</p>
        <p>At the other end of the spectrum is Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Company and one of the most bearish of Wall Street bears.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biggs says the stock market could fall as much as 25 percent this year, largely because the Asian contagion may spread.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. economy is beginning to slow, the European economies are beginning to slow, and we're going to see less growth than is now expected,'' he said yesterday. ''A loss of pricing power is going to continue and earnings are going to be disappointing.''</p>
        <p>A big decline in the market is likely, he said, because the stock market in the United States has been ''priced for perfection.''</p>
