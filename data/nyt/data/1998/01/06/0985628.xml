        <p>In response to my one-sentence comment in a Dec. 29 news article questioning whether the expansion of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's powers has improved education in New York City's public schools, your Jan. 5 editorial accuses me of ''blasting'' the Chancellor.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to my one-sentence comment in a Dec. 29 news article questioning whether the expansion of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's powers has improved education in New York City's public schools, your Jan. 5 editorial accuses me of ''blasting'' the Chancellor. It further claims that I presume the public schools are ''irreparably compromised'' and must be replaced by ''vouchers, charter schools and semiprivate small schools.''</p>
        <p>I have never said, written or implied that the public schools are irreparably compromised or that they should be abandoned. The only issue is whether the system is succeeding in educating all children, and it clearly is not.</p>
        <p>New York City has a rigid bureaucratic system designed more than a century ago. The management of public education must become more flexible, not more centralized; the authorities should set standards, then give school leaders greater control over their staff and budget. Thirty states have passed charter-school laws. This is not a radical proposal.  As for vouchers, they should be available on a means-tested basis for poor children at risk of failure. I have never proposed that public education be replaced by semiprivate small schools.</p>
