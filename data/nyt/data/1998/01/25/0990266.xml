        <p>One day, it might not be unusual to receive a thank-you note headed ''From the crib of,'' judging from the growing number of toddlers and young children who have their own personalized stationery and calling cards.</p>
        <p>On a recent morning, Myra Glass took her daughters, Lucille, 6, and Bess, 3, to Kate's Paperie, at 8 West 13th Street, to look at stationery. ''Bess recently had a birthday, and I want her to be able to send thank-you notes to all her friends,'' Mrs. Glass said as Bess pointed to the flowery designs. ''Good habits start early.'' Prices at Kate's range from $75 to $125 for a package of 25 sheets of paper, envelopes and calling cards.</p>

        <p>Rene Pastolove, the owner of Blue Mug Design, a stationery manufacturer in Peekskill, N.Y., says that whether the notes are written in the child's hand or a parent's, children love to see their full names in print. ''This helps insure a love of letters and communication,'' she said.</p>
