        <p>ON Mark Hoye's desk in the brand-new suburban offices of the mortgage company where he works are a few reminders of his former life as a Navy aviator -- a model of the P3 Orion submarine tracker he navigated in the Persian Gulf and the plaque they gave him after he came home.</p>
        <p>He unconsciously hugs the plaque to his chest as he tells about the time he and his crew spotted some Iraqis rolling free-floating mines off a speedboat. Using radar to ''paint'' the surface of the ocean, his team marked them for destruction by smart bomb. He got a nice letter from the high command for that one, he says.</p>
        <p>And about two years later, in the huge downsizing that shrank the ranks of the United States military to 1.4 million from 2.1 million over the last decade, he was pushed into early retirement at age 33.</p>
        <p>Like many others who left the military in the years after the cold war, Mr. Hoye eventually found a good job in a good economy. He bought a house in Virginia and has gotten to know his children in a way that he says would never have been possible in the military.</p>
        <p>Still, the transition has been bewildering.</p>
        <p>He knew he could fly a plane from Japan to a dot in the Indian Ocean and not get lost; he did not know how to steer clear of office politics. He knew he could be locked in a small, dark space and keep his cool; he did not know how to handle the everyday domestic stresses that go with being a husband and father who is around more.</p>
        <p>After leaving the Navy nearly five years ago, at the height of the reductions in force, Mr. Hoye worked for two different start-up satellite communications companies that eventually went under. He also went to graduate school to study international business -- ''a waste of money,'' he says -- before finding his current position, as a loan officer, nine months ago.</p>
        <p>Along the way, he struggled with depression, new strains on his marriage and the strange feeling that he had almost been relocated to some alien planet.</p>
        <p>''We crushed the Iraqis and had a feeling of accomplishment, and the drawdown hit us hard,'' said Mr. Hoye, now 37, whose neat pinstripes and perfectly shined shoes set him apart in a dressed-down office. ''We didn't understand, and none of us wanted to go. I'm starting to do better, but there have been some rough periods.''</p>
        <p>In the military, he said, ''what I did mattered.''</p>
        <p>''What I was doing was on the front page of all the world's newspapers,'' he said. ''To be yanked out of that in midcareer -- I have not stopped grieving. I try to keep myself entertained. I have season tickets to the Orioles. But there's just as much stress now, where you just want to choke somebody on the phone. And I felt safer in my P3 Orion than driving on I-95 every day.''</p>
        <p>Of course, some former soldiers and sailors have always found civilian life more daunting than war. And while no one has gathered data on the more than 700,000 men and women who have left the military since the late 1980's, it is clear that many of every rank go on to do extremely well.</p>
        <p>But many who were pushed out of the military say they remain traumatized by the experience, whether they were literally asked to leave, were offered early retirement, were denied a promotion in a force with fewer opportunities or decided for other reasons not to stay in a smaller military.</p>
        <p>Many had never received a negative job evaluation, so they were both hurt and uncomprehending: What had they done wrong? And what of the job security they had counted on? Some said they felt even more betrayed than private-sector employees in similar situations because there are no other jobs in their field, strictly speaking; you  cannot apply to the Navy when the Air Force does not want you anymore.</p>
        <p>Sam Martin, a public-affairs officer who was asked to leave the Air Force in 1992 after almost 26 years of steady advancement, said he found the change stimulating -- once he got over the initial shock.</p>
        <p>Today, teaching civics to eighth graders at Rocky Run Middle School in Chantilly, Va., Mr. Martin, 55, says he is completely engaged in his new work. ''The kids do not snap to attention,'' he laughed. ''But they're good kids; they keep you in stitches. I equate the military officer and the teacher trying to do so much for the nation.''</p>
        <p>Others, however, remain deeply resentful, feeling that their sacrifices were repaid with ingratitude. And not one of the several dozen former military men and women interviewed for this article said the shift had been painless.</p>
        <p>They have gone from a highly structured life to winging it, from knowing years in advance what their next move would be to the uncertainty of the private sector, from being part of a community to standing alone. Some said that they felt uncertain for a while about their clothes, hair and other matters of personal style, and that they had to work on their manner of speech, too, turning ''0900 hours'' back into ''9 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>One former officer had never had a business lunch until a couple of years ago and was unsure how to behave. Another found it strange that in his new job, nobody knew how much money anyone else was making. Several said that they were initially too trusting of employers and colleagues and too-good-to-be-true job offers. You have to trust the guy in the next foxhole, they concluded, but the guy in the next cubicle may be a different story.</p>
        <p>''I have business associates now, as opposed to people you work with who are truly your friends,'' said Nadine R. Kokolis, 30, of Chantilly.  Ms. Kokolis said she liked her new life but missed the camaraderie in the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>More than a few veteran officers lamented their skimpy business experience, even when they had shouldered considerable responsibility in the military. Some said they felt misled about how much their management skills would help in the private sector.</p>
        <p>And despite a variety of career transition programs, some said they came out of the service without much of a plan for the future, because military culture has traditionally frowned on those who spend much time preparing for their next job, instead of focusing 100 percent on the mission at hand. There is a sneering term for that: retired on active duty.</p>
        <p>So, several former officers said, they worked hard until the end of their last day, and then figured the rest out later.</p>
        <p>''It's like dying,'' said Steve Strobridge, a retired Air Force colonel who works for the Retired Officers Association in Alexandria, Va. ''It sneaks up on you.''</p>
        <p>MOST of those who were actually asked to leave the military already had 20 years of service and were eligible for pensions. And those who were within a few years of qualifying for a pension  were offered early retirement on a case-by-case basis, receiving a choice of a lump sum or monthly payments based on the number of years they had served. The monthly payments ranged from $471 for the lowest-ranking enlisted person to $2,349 for commissioned officers. The lump sums were about $12,000 to almost $150,000, based on pay grade and years of service.</p>
        <p>Others with less experience were told that they had little chance of promotion in a shrinking military, and while they were not literally dismissed, they were encouraged to look for other work. And most of those who left under those circumstances got no severance package.</p>
        <p>There are roughly 90,000 former military men and women in the Washington area, many of them drawn here by military industry and Government jobs. But a number of those have recently been forced back into the job market for a second and even a third time because both of those sectors are shrinking, too.</p>
        <p>Because many military officers were given considerable responsibility at a younger age than would generally be possible in the private sector, most do very well in their new fields, said H. W. Buse 3d, a former Marine colonel who runs a job placement service at the Retired Officers Association. Mr. Buse said his clients usually found other jobs in one to three months -- though the average was closer to six months at the height of the downsizing.</p>
        <p>Stephen Wright, an official of the regional blood bank operations affiliated with the American Red Cross, has hired several former military officers in the last year and is so impressed that he now looks for them when there are openings.</p>
        <p>''I find them to be good hires for managers' jobs because military people tend to be very disciplined, focused and very flexible, which in our operation is a real asset,'' said Mr. Wright, who said he had no military background beyond the Reserve Officers Training Corps in school. ''A lot of them have had some medical training, too, so their learning curve tends to be shorter.''</p>
        <p>Of course, while officers with such technical skills are usually snapped up right away, military generalists -- infantry soldiers, for example -- often find it more difficult to find the right job. And even if they do find a comparable position, they may not find it as satisfying. In the Army, a clerk is not only a clerk but a soldier who happens to be a clerk, a part of the team.</p>
        <p>On a recent morning, about 40 former military men and women who were looking for work gathered at the Army-Navy Club in downtown Washington for a monthly breakfast organized by Peter McCarthy, who runs a career counseling and outplacement service, McCarthy &amp; Company. When he retired from the Marines and took a job in investment banking 18 years ago, he said, he felt like ''a giant tuna swimming in the Baltimore aquarium with a bunch of piranha.''</p>
        <p>This morning, as he he surveys the crowd lining up for eggs and sausage, he talks about why he feels a little protective of them.</p>
        <p>''I don't want them to jump into something entrepreneurial too quickly,'' he says. ''They may be too trusting of somebody saying, 'Invest in this business.' They have no real-world experience.''</p>
        <p>Across a room full of people with excellent posture, nice manners and the unmistakable look of apprehension that says, ''How did it ever come to this?'' Mr. McCarthy spies one of the success stories he has invited here to give a little pep talk, and he motions him over. Al Ross, a former Navy captain who retired in 1993 after 26 years, says he now has a healthy business in international marketing consulting -- despite having come out of the service with little idea of how to proceed.</p>
        <p>''My business has evolved, but not as the result of any master plan,'' Mr. Ross says, laughing. ''Networking in the military is kind of distasteful. That would be getting ahead not on merit but on who you know.''</p>
        <p>After breakfast, Mr. McCarthy gets up and asks everyone to take a turn giving ''a 30-second commercial on yourself.''</p>
        <p>''And remember the golden rule. What's that, gentlemen?'' he says, putting a hand to his ear. ''I can't hear you! It's ''No acronyms!' '' They're lost, he said, on people in the private sector.</p>
        <p>At Mr. McCarthy's table, one man  calls him ''sir'' and gets a reprimand. ''You drop that,'' Mr. McCarthy tells him, ''or you're going to intimidate the hell out of people.''</p>
        <p>The man, Neil Nelson, still in Army uniform, is a colonel who plans to retire next October. He starts again: ''Sir, I -- oh, I apologize, I'll get used to it. It's been 32 years.''</p>
        <p>Another man at the table, Joel Keefer, who left the Navy in 1993 after 22 years, says he is seeking work again, in public relations. He had worked for a health care telecommunications company that later folded.</p>
        <p>The loyalty and can-do attitude that served so well in the military have not been much help in civilian life so far, he says, seeming a little embarrassed that he stuck with the company to the end.</p>
        <p>He stayed on even after the company stopped paying him, though he eventually got a check, and he still says ''us'' when he refers to the business. ''I knew the end was coming, but my approach was, 'Stay with it and we can make this work,' '' says Mr. Keefer, 48, who lives in Vienna, Va. ''I don't want to say I had blind faith, but I trusted the situation. If I had shifted my attention to getting another position, it wouldn't have been so stressful.''</p>
        <p>Even those who have found good jobs quickly say they have found some aspects of civilian life confounding.</p>
        <p>After six promotions in three years at two different companies, Marty Keeley, 46, a former Marine infantry officer, is now president and chief executive of Ingram Library Services, a unit of Ingram Industries, a book distributor based near Nashville. Even so, he says, he has faced ''a vertical learning curve'' during the last few years in bridging the cultural divide between military and civilian life.</p>
        <p>He found that even socializing was a new experience outside the military, without the framework of strict rules about fraternization. And especially among people his own age, he has felt he had to overcome certain stereotypes about the military. ''Some you have to win them over, like, 'Hey, I'm not a baby killer,' '' Mr. Keeley said.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, he would never have done as well without his experience in the military. ''I'm not using the survival skills I learned as an infantry officer; I haven't rappelled since I left,'' he explained. ''But I use the persuasive skills every day.''</p>
        <p>WHATEVER the challenges, few veteran officers are openly critical of their treatment, either by the military or civilian employers. ''You do what you've got to do and let everyone else whine and complain,'' said a former Air Force captain, one of many who says he has a ''consulting business'' but means he is mostly looking for work. ''I'm looking,'' he said, ''but I've succeeded in everything I've done, and I make no excuses for myself.''</p>
        <p>And many retain such great affection for the military that they would return to the fold tomorrow, if they could. Mr. Hoye, who misses his days as a Naval officer, knows there's no  going back but hopes that his sons, Tyler, now 3, and Matthew, 6, will someday pick up where he left off.</p>
        <p>''My dream for them,'' he said, ''is the Naval Academy.''</p>
