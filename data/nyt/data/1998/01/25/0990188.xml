        <p>BRIDGES COMMUNITIES of New London has embarked on a $72 million plan to develop assisted-living complexes in six Connecticut towns. The initiative is one of the most ambitious by a state-based developer since such projects were authorized by law in 1995.</p>
        <p>Construction has started on an 85,000-square-foot, 108-unit complex adjacent to The Green at Maple, a condominium project for the elderly in Rocky Hill, just south of Hartford. And the developer is renovating a 95,000-square-foot former classroom building of Quinnipiac College to produce 113 units in Hamden, a suburb of New Haven.</p>

        <p>BRIDGES COMMUNITIES of New London has embarked on a $72 million plan to develop assisted-living complexes in six Connecticut towns. The initiative is one of the most ambitious by a state-based developer since such projects were authorized by law in 1995.</p>
        <p>Construction has started on an 85,000-square-foot, 108-unit complex adjacent to The Green at Maple, a condominium project for the elderly in Rocky Hill, just south of Hartford. And the developer is renovating a 95,000-square-foot former classroom building of Quinnipiac College to produce 113 units in Hamden, a suburb of New Haven.</p>
        <p>A third site is off Interstate 95 in Waterford, just west of New London, where Bridges Communities will demolish an unfinished office building and construct a 113-unit, 91,000-square-foot complex.</p>
        <p>Additional sites will be chosen soon in three other towns, said George C. Prouty Jr., executive vice president of the development company.</p>
        <p>Each complex will have a special unit for residents with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.</p>
        <p>Monthly charges are expected to start at about $2,200 a month, which will include three meals a day, housekeeping and weekly linens. Other services on site, such as health and personal care, can be arranged at additional cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prouty served on the task force that recommended that the state allow assisted living, which had been impossible under former regulations. Those regulations required round-the-clock on-site health care, among other restrictions.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't intentional, it wasn't that someone had thrown up a roadblock to assisted living,'' said Mr. Prouty. ''It was just a quirk of the regulations -- they were essentially licensed the same as nursing homes and other health-care operations.''  But it was almost impossible to provide such services on a small scale, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prouty said the anticipated market for the Bridges Communities projects is the person who needs help with at least one activity of daily living, such as personal hygiene, nutrition, or medical care.</p>
        <p>''This will allow the residents to schedule the help they need, when they need it,'' Mr. Prouty said. ''Or, if you wake up in the middle of the night and feel faint, you push a button and help is on the way.</p>
        <p>''You will only pay for what you use. If you're living there and you're fully independent and the only thing you need is medical management, because you're on some complex medical regimen, you can buy just that service, and someone will come in once a day to help you manage your medication.''</p>
        <p>William G. White, president of Bridges Communities, and the owner of the Beechwood Manor nursing home in New London,  said based on information from the National Center for Health Statistics, he expected the average resident would use about 45 minutes of additional services per day, which would add about $18 a day to the bill, or about $550 a month.</p>
        <p>Mr. White said he and others in the industry had realized for years the need for something between fully independent living and convalescent care.</p>
        <p>''Running the nursing home, we see so many people who are going home, and there's a great deal of concern because something as simple as stairs have become a major problem,'' Mr. White said. ''Moving into assisted living is not a lifestyle choice for most people. What happens is, someone has a hip replaced, and they live in a neighborhood where they're on the second or third floor, and their old home or apartment doesn't make sense anymore.''</p>
        <p>NO state agency tracks how many assisted living projects are in the planning stage, but Mr. White, who is also the secretary of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, said the estimate is that 25 projects will come into service over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. White and Mr. Prouty, the partners in Bridges Communities are M. David Vail, who was formerly a marketing manager for Manor Care, and Sheryl Girouard, who is vice president of Beechwood.</p>
        <p>The change in the law regarding assisted-living residences has attracted considerable interest from large national companies such as Marriott and Manor Care. Mr. Prouty said there were about 175,000 people over the age of 75 in Connecticut today of whom as many as 25,000 are candidates for assisted living, which creates a huge market potential.</p>
        <p>The state's Department of Public Health has licensed 21 assisted-living service agencies (one is required at each project) in the last three years, said a spokeswoman for the department.</p>
        <p>In Hamden, Town Planner Daniel W. Kops Jr. said that in addition to the Bridges Communities project, Carematrix Corporation of Needham, Mass., had won approval for 100 units of assisted living and Manor Care of Fairfax, Va., for a 60-unit complex both in Hamden.</p>
        <p>''The Planning and Zoning Commission feels these are very important facilities, and has spent a lot of time not only on the regulations, but reviewing the applications to make sure they are as well-designed as possible,'' Mr. Kops said.</p>
        <p>The regulations require green space around the projects and outdoor areas that are usable by the elderly, which means they cannot have steep slopes or other impediments. The commission even sent the Carematrix plan back so that an indoor atrium could be redesigned to improve views.</p>
        <p>''The commission thought assisted living would meet a real need in the community, if it is done right,'' Mr. Kops said. ''Some of the commissioners have relatives who have been in this kind of community in other states, and felt it really has the potential to benefit people locally.''</p>
        <p>Kim Ricci, the Town Planner in Rocky Hill, agreed. ''Based on national trends, and just looking at the last census when our population of people over 65 increased by about 14 or 15 percent, I think there's a strong need for a project like this,'' Ms. Ricci said. ''People are living longer and don't necessarily want the responsibility of large yards and driveways to shovel and everything else that goes along with home ownership.''</p>
        <p>The Town of Rocky Hill town has already seen three other projects opened or approved, totaling 257 units.</p>
        <p>Robert T. Hall, the municipal agent for aging in Rocky Hill, said while the developer's market studies show a need in his community, at least part of it is for people who are moving in from out of town.</p>
        <p>''The people who come into the senior center here, they're mostly low-  or middle-income,'' Mr. Hall said. ''These are private companies, and they're not inexpensive.''</p>
        <p>ASSISTED living, which has been popular in most of the country since the first projects were developed about 1981, and has evolved into a $13 billion a year industry. Experts say the idea of assisted living has merit for many elderly people, but they choices should be considered carefully.</p>
        <p>''Assisted living tells people, 'We'll help you take care of what you can't do, or don't want to do, and you can do the rest on your own,' which is going to do a great deal to allow people to preserve their independence and autonomy,'' said Ruth A. Gulyas, director of assisted living for the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which is based in Washington. The group represents more than 5,000 nursing homes and other housing projects for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Assisted-living arrangements vary widely, said Ms. Gulyas, and people should understand what they are buying when they begin to compare prices. Two apartments near each other might cost about the same and both might offer personal-care services, but it might be 10 minutes a day at one and 30 minutes at another.</p>
        <p>''People have to ask a lot of questions,'' Ms. Gulyas said. ''And you need to anticipate your needs six months to a year out, and figure out if they will provide the services you're going to need, or if not, what you're going to have to pay to bring those services in.''</p>
        <p>''In theory, assisted living is useful in helping people stay in the community who would otherwise be unable to stay,'' said Dr. Richard W. Besdine, director of the University of Connecticut Center on Aging in Farmington. ''The problem arises if these are marketed on emotional grounds to people who are perfectly capable of staying in their own home or apartment. But they get stampeded into these arrangements prematurely because they're asked, 'What if you have a stroke?' or, 'What if you fall?'</p>
        <p>''This is not where the majority of older Americans should be living,'' Dr. Besdine said. ''But for people who have a need, this is a great arrangement.''</p>
        <p>The buildings in each of the Bridges Communities projects will share a fairly standard design -- four clusters of four rooms each on three floors, centered around a central services area, where there will be elevators, lounges, and special services. In Hamden, these services will include an ice cream parlor, delicatessen and coffee shop.</p>
        <p>The coffee shops and other retail amenities are to provide a place not only for residents, but for relatives and friends who visit. They will operate on limited hours (probably 11 A.M. to 3 P.M., then 4 to 6 P.M.), Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>The intent is for the small clusters to create a feeling of neighborhoods within the buildings. The projects are all between 100 and 125 units, which Mr. White said permits efficiencies of scale, while recognizing that residents in assisted living stay an average of 3.2 years.</p>
        <p>''With 100 units, you have someone leaving every week or two,'' Mr. White said. ''If you double that to 200, you're seeing, on average, more than one resident a week move out, which can be pretty disruptive. You have to understand the nature of the client if you're going to undertake something like this.''</p>
