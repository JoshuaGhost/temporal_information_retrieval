        <p>TEXAS plans to execute Karla Faye Tucker on Feb. 3, the first woman since the Civil War to join that state's increasingly efficient march to the executioner. Her case has focused attention on a state where executions now verge on routine. Last year, Texas executed 37 men, more than any other state in any year since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment two decades ago.</p>
        <p>Texas justice may demonstrate a hardening of the public resolve to execute criminals. But the rest of the country has been unable to come close to Texas's record.</p>
        <p>Enduring Ambivalence</p>
        <p>In the view of some, the failure to enforce the death penalty reflects an enduring ambivalence about capital punishment. Others say that death penalty opponents have found ways to triumph over the public will to carry out executions. But in many places, the answer may simply lie in the extraordinary efforts to insure fairness in the business of administering the ultimate punishment.</p>
        <p>Excluding Texas, the number of executions in 1997 actually declined. There were 37 executions in other states last year, down from 45 in 1996. The drop happened despite a new Federal law and a recent series of decisions by the Supreme Court curtailing appeals by death row inmates.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the number of people on death row nationwide has been growing by an average of 100 to 150 a year, and has reached a record of 3,269. At this rate, more criminals sentenced to death will die of natural causes than will be executed.</p>
        <p>Swift Justice</p>
        <p>So why can't a nation where 70 percent of the population says it supports the death penalty achieve its stated goal: to speed up the process and deliver swift justice to its most vicious criminals?</p>
        <p>To liberals, the answer is that the American people are fundamentally ambivalent about the death penalty, regardless of what they say in opinion polls. Conservatives, taking note of the opinion polls, insist the problem lies with the willingness of too many judges to hear endless appeals, so that the average length of time spent by a convict on death row is 8.8 years.</p>
        <p>Yet there are more mundane reasons. An unwillingness to provide adequate money for lawyers to represent unpopular defendants has led to a large number of appealable mistakes, according to judges and prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Malfunctions</p>
        <p>So, the very people who push for tough and swift justice may help provide the means of delaying or reversing death sentences.</p>
        <p>Numbingly complex procedural issues also bog down the system.</p>
        <p>In Florida, for example, which has 380 convicts on death row, appeals do not even begin until the Governor signs a death warrant, sometimes years after conviction.</p>
        <p>Further complicating the situation in Florida, all executions there were put on hold last year after flames shot out of a prisoners face mask during his execution. The state Supreme Court eventually held that the electric chair was not cruel and unusual punishment, but it warned that malfunctions could create a ''constitutional train wreck,'' and urged that the legislature consider other means of execution.</p>
        <p>Craig Waters, a spokesman for the Florida Supreme Court, said the matter has created a new problem. Many death sentences already handed down in Florida include the words, ''A current of electricity shall be passed through your body until you are dead,'' he said. If the electric chair is not used, many on death row might assert a new right to appeal, he said.</p>
        <p>Gerald Kogan, the chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court, touched off an outcry earlier this month when he said publicly that his court is so bogged down with capital cases that ''the death penalty is not working.'' Some of his justices, he said, are spending up to half their time just on death penalty appeals. He suggested that sentencing murderers to life without parole might make more sense.</p>
        <p>The issue of adequate defense is emerging as a key one in many states. In Alabama, defense lawyers receive $1,000 to prepare for a murder trial, and another $1,000 for the sentencing phase. So, in practice, the trials often last only a day or two, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death penalty group.</p>
        <p>''People will spend money on punishment and prisons, but not for defense attorneys,'' Mr. Dieter said.</p>
        <p>As a result, the rate of errors in capital trials is high, he said, with about 35 percent of death penalty cases overturned on appeal, compared to only 5 percent in non-capital punishment cases.</p>
        <p>In California, where there are now 501 people on death row, the highest number in the nation, there is such a shortage of money for lawyers that convicts sentenced to death wait an average of four years to be assigned an appeal lawyer, said Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>More for Lawyers</p>
        <p>Then it takes another 8 to 10 years for an appeal to make its way through the state courts in California. Only four inmates have been put to death in California in the past 20 years. ''You can either call that a statistical accident, or you can say there is real ambivalence fueling the system,'' said Professor Zimring.</p>
        <p>A provision last year to increase state spending on lawyers in death penalty cases by $2 million, which would have raised the attorneys' hourly fees from $75 to $125, was cut from the California budget and rerouted to a state workers pension fund.</p>
        <p>Dane Gillette, the senior assistant Attorney General and California's death penalty coordinator, said that because of changes on the California Supreme Court, it is less of an obstacle to imposition of the death penalty that it was a decade ago. Now, he said, the biggest obstacle is the Federal courts.</p>
        <p>Texas, with its 37 executions in 1997, half the national total of 74, offers the sharpest contrast to California. But Mike McCormick, the presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest court in criminal matters, said that last year's large total gave Texas a deceptive reputation for assembly line justice. He said the number stemmed from Texas having been one of the earliest states to reinstitute the death penalty in the 1970's and that many of the cases were only now finishing their trip through the appeals process.</p>
        <p>''Time finally ran out for them,'' Judge McCormick said. Still, said Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Services, ''What you are seeing in Texas is a reflection of the mood of the public in a very conservative state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dieter, of the anti-death penalty group, predicted that the zeal for capital punishment will eventually wane. The number of death sentences imposed has remained constant at about 300 a year since 1986, he said. And in some states, the number of new death sentences has remained flat or decreased since the passage of laws allowing for a sentence of for life without parole. ''When juries have a choice,'' Mr. Dieter said, ''they are picking that as a middle ground.''</p>
