        <p>Two Spaces/Expanded Concept</p>
        <p>Graphic Eye Gallery, 301 Main Street, Port Washington. To Feb. 2.  883-9668. Manhasset Public Library, 30 Onderdonk Avenue, Manhasset. To Feb. 28. 627-2300.</p>
        <p>While physically separate, these two presentations share the same participants and are closely related, especially because the second venue is treated as a way to offer additional aspects of current projects.</p>
        <p>With some 20 artists, the general character is that of a broad miscellany of interests and techniques, yet several works manage to stand apart at each locale. One of the most assertive pieces at the library is Clara Steiner's strangely aggressive, toy-inspired large drawing, ''Dolls-R-Us 2098,'' which removes the comfort of conventional scale and creates adult-eyed wise creatures hidden in the puffiness of Botero-like bodies and rendered with a vigorous graphic touch that allows hair to appear violently energized. By removing cuteness, the piece questions how we choose to abbreviate ourselves in the objects of childhood.</p>
        <p>On an adjacent wall, Ann Pellaton's large, compelling etching and collage is a swirl of bold faces and eyes, many recycled from news photos and Expressionist paintings.  It mixes memory, experience and the instinctive alarm felt when conscious of a piercing gaze.  Intuitive psychological responses are reinforced again in the nearby etchings of single, greatly enlarged hands by Ellen Brous.</p>
        <p>One of the best links between the two installations are the groupings from Naomi Grossman's forceful, engaging series, ''The Shrinking Brain,'' which features loose black and gray gestures coalescing into ambiguous, cloudlike forms that have incongruous, protruding stems.</p>
        <p>With its visual and emotional power, Stephanie Bloom's ''Mapping,'' an image of four chunky foot prints scratched out in white above a grid of dark papers, is easily the big impact work at the Port Washington gallery. In another winning grid piece, Allan Fishkind's assemblage of 22 photographs treats seagulls as abstract markings.</p>
        <p>Visitors should look in on the smaller, rear room too, where many of the artists are represented by effective pieces developed in a lesser scale. Highlights include a richly textured woodcut by Toby Sullivan, a bold figurative watercolor by Raisy Dersie, mixed media collages by Susan Kornblum and Shellie Schneider and a strongly colored work by Myrna Turtletaub that combines flat and illusionistic space.</p>
        <p>Group Show</p>
        <p>Vered Gallery, 66 Park Place Passage, East Hampton. To Feb. 16.  324-3303.</p>
        <p>Early in the viewing pattern for this rich show, visitors find a smart comparison between the gestural markings of three members of the Abstract Expressionist generation: broad, sparse strokes by Franz Kline, animated, sparking and direct improvisational lines by Willem de Kooning and more solid shapes by Conrad Marca-Relli that are handled in a way that allows the sensation of substantial movement.</p>
        <p>More fine discoveries are not too far away. Two watercolors by Egon Schiele represent different thematic points of his short career. One, a dynamically tipping image of a red-haired nude, her nervous quality accented with a white halo around the body, corresponds to the start, in 1910, of Schiele's use of lively, emphatic lines for contouring.</p>
        <p>Set off separately on a nearby wall is an unsigned portrait of a seated boy, discovered within the past decade and considered to be a  Picasso painting related to a lengthy stay in the Catalan mountain village, Horta de Ebro, in 1898. Like much of Picasso's other early work, it has a somber, introspective quality and attempts to blend emotional weight with formal impact.</p>
        <p>A number of other major artists are included in this very diversified collection, which starts chronologically with David Johnson and Thomas Eakins in the 1860's, moves on to Bruce Crane and a very small Thomas Moran oil sketch from the 1870's and ends with several recent Wolf Kahn landscapes.</p>
        <p>Man Ray's mid-20's classic, ''Kiki,'' and his haunting ''Solarized Hands'' are highlights among the exhibition's photography selections and point to the artist's efforts to push the medium. The two largest paintings, by Milton Avery and Warren Brandt, make different but highly effective points about synthesis and careful construction and both contribute considerably to the exhibition's caliber.</p>
        <p>Dealer's Choice</p>
        <p>Bujese Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. To Feb. 1. 324-2823.</p>
        <p>This large and fairly lively selection does a good job of emphasizing the broad range of the gallery's interests and its concentration of American art of the last 50 years. There are figurative, three-dimensional and conceptual pieces and a broad view of explorations in abstract directions.</p>
        <p>Most areas reveal a comfortable blend of generations. Abstract works, for example, include strong examples by Betty Parsons and Conrad Marca-Relli along with mid-career artists like David Slater and Faith-Dorian Wright and younger artists like Priscilla Heine, Kathleen Kucka and Linda Stein. Harnessing energy in a very contemporary way, Ms. Kucka uses the unpredictability of burn marks in a rhythmic sequence, while Ms. Stein develops powerful abstract masses from small molecules that look like the connectors on some electronic highway. In sculpture, too, the range includes top quality bronzes by Stanley Kearl and Ibram Lassaw along with a recent, highly evocative work by Pam Erickson Davis that places a metaphorical object -- a tiny shed of lizard skin -- on a pock-marked, archaic stone form.</p>
        <p>Several figurative highlights are notable for their psychological edge, particularly the moody, penetrating examples by Howard Kanovitz, Robert Marx and Michael Roesch.</p>
