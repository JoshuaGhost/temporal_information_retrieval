        <p>The Greaseless Cookware People were back.</p>
        <p>Ken and Pat Silvestri see them, just as they see countless other exhibitors, year after year when they attend the Garden State Home Design and Landscape Show in Morristown.</p>
        <p>''I've seen the Hot Tub People here before,'' said Pat Silvestri, to which her husband added, ''The Gutter People are always here, too.''</p>
        <p>And the Silvestris themselves? Call them the Expo People. They are just two of tens of thousands of New Jerseyans who on any given weekend, from fall to spring, can be found attending large expositions in convention centers or armories, or smaller ones in schools, malls or firehouses. These shows offer everything from a $2 frog lawn ornament to a $129,000 recreation vehicle with bathroom and shower.</p>
        <p>On the same Saturday the Silvestris attended the home show in the National Guard Armory, they could also have chosen a wedding exposition in a Parsippany hotel; a computer show in a Newark hotel; a show of antiques, collectibles and crafts at the Livingston Mall; a sports card show at a firehouse in Bridgewater, or a doll and bear show at the firehouse in Colts Neck.</p>
        <p>At the 30th New Jersey Trailer and Camping Show at the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center in Edison, James Atkins of Keyport, who has attended 20 such events, was listening for new tips about the joys and pitfalls of recreational vehicles.</p>
        <p>And at the New Jersey Auto Show at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, Phillip Hernandez of Elizabeth sheepishly posed behind the wheel of a red Mercedes SLK230 Kompressor sports coupe that sells for about $39,000. His friend Tania Copa of Newark snapped his photograph.</p>
        <p>Expositions are in the thick of a culture in which recreation and shopping are often synonymous. But they also bring under one cavernous roof a broad display of goods to buy, be they kitchens, campers or cars.</p>
        <p>''Why do people go to malls rather than into a downtown?'' asked Jim McLaughlin, a partner in McLaughlin Associates of Spring Lake, which has operated the Trailer and Camping Show for three decades. ''Malls have four or five department stores. We're doing the same thing.''</p>
        <p>The Silvestris, who go to five or six shows a year at the armory alone, in part because it is only a mile from their house, view expositions as both fun and educational.</p>
        <p>''We always come to this one,'' Mr. Silvestri, a psychologist, said as he ate lunch with his wife and their daughter, Caroline, who gives her age as ''7 and three-quarters.'' ''There are a lot of things we like to do around our house. We get a lot of ideas.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Silvestri, a former banker, added, ''A show like this gives you an idea of what kind of people you're dealing with in terms of salespeople and the contractors.''</p>
        <p>Do the Expo People differ from expo to expo?</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' said Lisa Kaczorowski, owner of Fill-a-Belly Deli of Morristown, which caters most armory expositions.</p>
        <p>''The computer show is hot dogs, a bag of chips and a soda,'' Ms. Kaczorowski said. ''The antiques show is definitely a more upscale menu like this one,'' she said, referring to the menu for the home show. Examples: a Caesar salad with chicken breast, or a salmon plate.</p>
        <p>''For the crafts show,'' she said, ''you also have a lot more vegetarians.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the Sun Room People, like Bruce M. Zaffe, a design consultant for Four Seasons Sun Rooms of Parsippany, who has been exhibiting at the home show for about five years. Most people he meets, he said, are ''middle-class and upwardly mobile,'' and generally from Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Sussex Counties, although the Silvestris have seen cars pass their house on expo weekends from as far away as Kentucky.</p>
        <p>And Expo People spend money. Patrick Watts, a salesman for Healthcraft Waterless and Greaseless Cookware, after giving only two cooking demonstrations, had a dozen orders in hand, representing about $12,000 in sales.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLaughlin said about 14,000 people attended the trailer and camping show in Edison last weekend and about 120 of them placed orders for recreation vehicles.</p>
        <p>The Expo People can be broken down into subcultures, with a Harley-Davidson show, for instance, drawing a crowd far different from the one at a kennel show.</p>
        <p>Surveys have shown that about 40 percent of those who go to the camping show have never owned an R.V. but are interested in exploring the possibility, Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
        <p>At the show, about 50 people sat listening to Phil and SuAnne Rollain, whose seminar fliers promote them as ''real R.V.'ers who will share their extensive trips, tips and experience.''</p>
        <p>''You don't buy this rig to sit it in your yard,'' Ms. Rollain told them. ''This will be something that will be part of your life style.''</p>
        <p>The Rollains bought a motor home about six years ago when Phil retired as vocational director of the schools in Chapel Hill-Carrboro, N.C. They have been giving seminars up and down the East Coast for about three years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rollain described the R.V. People, neophytes and veterans, as ''a total mix of people.'' There are, she said, ''your young people that have young families; your single people that want to have some adventure and enjoy being on the road without having to worry about being alone; your middle-aged couples who are trying to have a little diversity in their life from their humdrum working day, and then the retired group or pre-retired group that wants to be able to travel while their health is still good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkins, a school photographer who has owned R.V.'s since 1980, said he continued to attend shows ''to see what's new in the industry and to meet nice new people.''</p>
        <p>One of his new friends, James Gibbs, a retired civil court clerk from Brooklyn who bought a camper in May, said: ''The talk made me more informed about the R.V. world. I'm thirsty for knowledge. This is a whole new thing for me.''</p>
        <p>Another, Sheila Burnstein, a Social Security claims specialist from Elizabeth who recently bought a used 24-foot motor home, said, ''I'm learning how much knowledge you really have to have even before you turn the recreational vehicle on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkins, who had been trading road stories with them and sharing his expertise, said, ''We're human turtles.''</p>
        <p>''What does that mean?'' Ms. Burnstein asked.</p>
        <p>''It means we carry our house with us. We go to sleep in our shell at night, and every night we know exactly where we're going to sleep, except we don't know what location.''</p>
        <p>Of all the expositions, perhaps an auto show cuts most strongly across demographic lines, with total strangers suddenly finding themselves sitting next to each other in the same car.</p>
        <p>So Phillip Hernandez was far from the only person having his picture taken in front of his dream car. Most fellow dreamers were in their late teens and early 20's, and one of their favorite backdrops was a Mercedes-Benz S500V. Sticker price: $90,290.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hernandez, a 24-year-old security guard who had never been to an auto show before, favored the Kompressor.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to see the latest models,'' said Mr. Hernandez, who acknowledged that he would not be in the market anytime soon. ''I saw a couple that were interesting. This one got my attention. It's more compact and sporty-looking.''</p>
        <p>Not far away, Joe Abate, a retired truck driver from Clifton, was extracting himself from a high-from-the-ground sport utility vehicle, which his wife, Judy, was considering buying someday. But she thought the interior door paneling was cheesy and easy to scratch.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' Ms. Abate, assistant chief clerk of the Passaic County Register of Deeds, said of the show, ''I like it better than walking around showrooms. Nobody bugs you. You just have the freedom to walk around and see.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abate, who drives a Cadillac Seville, said he was not in the market for a new car but still liked to make the rounds of the auto shows, especially the one at the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I like cars,'' he said.</p>
