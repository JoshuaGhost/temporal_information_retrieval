        <p>Editorial disputes assertions by Diane Ravitch and others that new governance law has made no difference in New York City schools; says law frees district superintendents from outside political pressure while holding them accountable for school performance; says it came about only because Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew convinced Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Legislature that he was worthy of power (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With more than a million students, New York City's school system would be difficult to manage in the best of circumstances. Add in deteriorating buildings, stubborn unions and rapid turnover at the top, and the job seems insuperable. Yet critics are already blasting Chancellor Rudy Crew for not moving fast enough, though he has been in office for only two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crew has picked unnecessary fights and failed to disseminate his ideas clearly and to the widest possible audience. But it is far too early to say his administration has had no impact. That is pretty much what Diane Ravitch, the former Assistant Secretary of Education, did last week when she said that the new governance law Mr. Crew wrested from the State Legislature had made no difference at all.</p>

        <p>With more than a million students, New York City's school system would be difficult to manage in the best of circumstances. Add in deteriorating buildings, stubborn unions and rapid turnover at the top, and the job seems insuperable. Yet critics are already blasting Chancellor Rudy Crew for not moving fast enough, though he has been in office for only two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crew has picked unnecessary fights and failed to disseminate his ideas clearly and to the widest possible audience. But it is far too early to say his administration has had no impact. That is pretty much what Diane Ravitch, the former Assistant Secretary of Education, did last week when she said that the new governance law Mr. Crew wrested from the State Legislature had made no difference at all.</p>
        <p>The new law was in fact a major accomplishment, given the system's history of corruption and unruliness. Passed just over a year ago, the law came about only because Mr. Crew convinced Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Legislature that he was worthy of the power. The law frees district superintendents from outside political pressure while holding them accountable for school performance.</p>
        <p>State Education Commissioner Richard Mills is impressed with Mr. Crew's efforts. Just last November, the Commissioner commended the city for improving instruction and removing a record number of schools, 15 in all, from the state's failing list. Mr. Mills placed 20 other New York City schools on the list last year, but noted that these schools had higher achievement levels than schools that reached the list in the past. As the overall climate had improved, Mr. Mills said, the state had decided to judge the city's schools by tougher standards than it would have imposed in the past.</p>
        <p>Lurking behind Ms. Ravitch's criticism is the presumption that the public schools are irreparably compromised and that vouchers, charter schools and semiprivate small schools are the only real alternatives. Mr. Crew considers this a lifeboat approach and has promised a systemwide renaissance that some outside experts view as impossible. Given his broad new powers, Mr. Crew should be given a fair chance to see what he can do with them.</p>
