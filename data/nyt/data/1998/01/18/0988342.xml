        <p>RIESENFELD-William A. The Officers, Board members and the entire Beth Abraham Health Services community are profoundly saddened by the death of William Riesenfeld and mourn his passing. Bill approached everything he did with commitment and dedication, whether it was sports fishing (he held several world records) or competing in Squash (he was nationaly ranked) or emersing himself in health care. As a member of the Beth Abraham board since 1972, retiring as Chairman in 1996, he gave generously of himself, his time and knowledge. His guidance was of particular value in the area of real estate. He had a strong sense of humanity and displayed great empathy when visiting our patients. We will miss his wisdom and counsel and always cherish his memory. Edwin H. Stern, III Chairman, Board of Directors BETHCO Michael R. Potack Chairman, Board of Directors Beth Abraham Health Services William H. Frohlich President Beth Abraham Health Services</p>
