        <p>A 17-year-old Bronx boy with a sealed juvenile police record was charged yesterday with killing a teen-ager he did not know by firing a gun from his balcony into a noisy, after-school crowd that had gathered on the street below to watch two girls fight.</p>

        <p>A 17-year-old Bronx boy with a sealed juvenile police record was charged yesterday with killing a teen-ager he did not know by firing a gun from his balcony into a noisy, after-school crowd that had gathered on the street below to watch two girls fight.</p>
        <p>Investigators, who recovered what they said was the weapon, said the suspect admitted the shooting, but said that he had no real motive. It appeared that he just took a notion to fire into the crowd, and then did it.</p>
        <p>The police said the suspect, Aaron Callender, of 2550 Olinville Avenue in Bronxdale, was taken into custody at a relative's apartment before dawn and was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Vaughn Brown, 16, who was hit once in the chest Friday afternoon on White Plains Road near Allerton Avenue.</p>
        <p>In a city where stray bullets and random gunfire have faded from headlines, the shooting resonated with a not-so-distant past when drug wars often led to the sudden death of innocent strangers. The swift arrest eased fears in a neighborhood left jittery by the sniper fire, but the crime itself -- random, senseless, cold-blooded -- left even some investigators abashed.</p>
        <p>They said that the suspect, at home with his brother and two friends, heard the commotion on the street, went to his room, got a .22-caliber Beretta semiautomatic pistol, stepped out onto his 15th floor balcony and fired four or five shots into the crowd below.</p>
        <p>''He has nothing whatever to do with it,'' an investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, referring to the fighting and the crowd of scores of people. ''He just does it. I hate to say it, but he just does it.''</p>
        <p>It was not strange that someone was hit, the investigator said. ''It seems like a million-to-one shot, but you have to realize you're shooting into a crowd of 30 to 50 people standing close together,'' he said. ''So it's not surprising that you hit something. It defies logic that someone would start shooting like this.''</p>
        <p>Little was known of the suspect yesterday. Several youths outside the 18-story apartment building where he lives said they thought he was a student at Grace H. Dodge High School; others called him a dropout. Some said he liked to play basketball.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said the police arrested him last summer on what were thought to be drug and domestic violence charges. One neighbor said, ''I thought there was no doubt he would get into trouble. When his mom wasn't home, it was open house: traffic in and out, doors constantly slamming. I'm glad he's out of the building.''</p>
        <p>The police said only that Mr. Callender was on probation for offenses committed as a juvenile. His record was sealed because of his age, but it involved serious offenses, they said. ''If this had been an adult, he would have been doing a substantial amount of incarceration,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who joined Mr. Safir and investigators at a news conference at the 49th Precinct station house to announce the arrest, called the shooting ''a totally senseless crime,'' and used the occasion to repeat his call for unsealing the records of repeat juvenile offenders and eliminating parole.</p>
        <p>''He has a sealed record, we can't discuss it with you,'' the Mayor said of the suspect. ''I hope, once again, that the State Legislature will change the law to remove parole, make sure people spend all their time in jail for all the crimes they commit, and to do away with sealed records so that we can have some truth and honesty in the criminal justice system.''</p>
        <p>The Mayor, who had earlier tried to comfort the family of the slain youth, said: ''The family is devastated. It is a very large and close family. This is an act that, if the criminal justice system worked properly, didn't have to happen.''</p>
        <p>The victim, Mr. Brown, was described by friends as a popular ninth grader at Dodge High School, talented scholastically and a good basketball player who made the school's varsity team as a freshman. He lived with his mother at the Parkside Houses.</p>
        <p>It was shortly before 2:45 P.M. on Friday that Mr. Brown, walking home with a friend, Janaya Sims, 15, stopped to watch a fight that had developed between two girls as Intermediate School 135 let out for the day. The fight swirled into White Plains Road, near Allerton Avenue, and Mr. Brown was among many who stood around to watch.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the commotion had been noticed by Mr. Callender, his brother and two friends, who were in his apartment, 15A, at 2550 Olinville Avenue, a high-rise building overlooking the scene of the fight. The two friends went onto the balcony to watch, the investigator said.</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Callender went to his bedroom, got out a .22-caliber Beretta -- it was unclear who owned the weapon or where it had come from, though the police said it was unlicensed -- and strode to the balcony. He looked down on the crowd, pointed the pistol vaguely down at it and opened fire, the investigators said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown was struck once in the chest by a bullet. He staggered for 50 feet before collapsing. As the crowd scattered and the police arrived, the victim was taken to Jacobi Medical Center and pronounced dead.</p>
        <p>Within 10 minutes of the shooting, investigators had begun to focus on the upper floors of 2550 Olinville Avenue, where witnesses said they had seen the muzzle flashes of a gun.</p>
        <p>Witnesses and residents of the building soon led the investigators to focus on Apartment 15A, one detective said. But it was late in the evening before search warrants were obtained. By then, one investigator said, the suspect had told his mother what had happened, and she had called the police.</p>
        <p>There were conflicting reports yesterday on the suspect's reaction when taken into custody. One detective said he was remorseful. ''He kept on crying, saying over and over again, 'I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to kill him.' ''</p>
        <p>But a senior investigator said the suspect had been ''very calm and very cooperative'' when he explained what had happened. Later, however, the suspect sobbed quietly as he was led away in handcuffs from the 49th Precinct station. To a reporter's question, he mumbled: ''I didn't do nothing.''</p>
