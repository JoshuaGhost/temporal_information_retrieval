        <p>MULTIDEALER antiques centers are not only springing up but also seeming to beget one another. The Antique and Artisan Center opened on Jefferson Street in Stamford a year and a half ago, and  was followed in August of this year by Hiden Galleries, one block west on Canal Street. A third, also on Canal Street is the Stamford Antiques Center, opened Jan. 1 to much fanfare -- brunch, drinks and dancing in the aisles amidst their reason for being,  antiques and collectibles from 158 dealers.</p>
        <p>In Darien, Bonnie Morgan, said she had to decide whether to invest her money in a business or home, and opted for the former. She rented a schoolhouse dating to the 1800's and converted it into an antiques center, called Morgan's, with space for 17 dealers on Tokeneke Road. The white-on-white hands-on environment with stall collections, jewelry, painted furniture, a little bit of everything, has been open since July 1.</p>

        <p>MULTIDEALER antiques centers are not only springing up but also seeming to beget one another. The Antique and Artisan Center opened on Jefferson Street in Stamford a year and a half ago, and  was followed in August of this year by Hiden Galleries, one block west on Canal Street. A third, also on Canal Street is the Stamford Antiques Center, opened Jan. 1 to much fanfare -- brunch, drinks and dancing in the aisles amidst their reason for being,  antiques and collectibles from 158 dealers.</p>
        <p>In Darien, Bonnie Morgan, said she had to decide whether to invest her money in a business or home, and opted for the former. She rented a schoolhouse dating to the 1800's and converted it into an antiques center, called Morgan's, with space for 17 dealers on Tokeneke Road. The white-on-white hands-on environment with stall collections, jewelry, painted furniture, a little bit of everything, has been open since July 1.</p>
        <p>In Ridgefield, Judith Baxter opened De Ja Vu, an antiques supermarket of 15 dealers in a Victorian house on Catoonah Avenue (half a block from Main Street) one and a half years ago.</p>
        <p>Each center has a slightly different atmosphere and direction, but all are places for discovery and a trip down nostalgia lane.</p>
        <p>For shoppers, the centers represent concentrated havens. For dealers, they spell freedom from minding the shop. One dealer, Muriel Neufeld, is displaying at three centers: Morgan's, the Antique and Artisan Center and now the Stamford Antiques Center, after closing her own Gilded Lily Antiques Shop in Cos Cob at the end of December.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't enough visibility, which made it fail,'' said Ms. Neufeld, known for vintage costume jewelry, beaded and needlepoint purses and small furniture. ''So I decided to go into another multidealer place and free up my time. I'm responsible for having the booths look fresh and buying new merchandise. The centers,'' she added, ''have ready-made traffic. They do a lot of advertising.''</p>
        <p>Although Ron Scinto and his partner, Mark Candid, claim no previous experience in the antiques business, they had a vision -- to fill a void by opening the first antiques center in the warehouse section of downtown Stamford. ''Everybody said it wouldn't fly here, but we brought it about,'' said Mr. Scinto.</p>
        <p>They opened the Antique and Artisan Center at 69 Jefferson Street in 1996; they have 99 dealers and a waiting list. The 22,000-square-foot center is divided into three sections with 60 room settings. The middle post-and-beam section was an ice house during the turn of the century and trains pulled up to their loading docks. Among the center's displays are 18th-  through 20th-century works, Art Deco, Art Moderne and folk art; primarily, however, the center's dealers focus on furniture.</p>
        <p>''We changed the way people antique in New England,'' Mr. Scinto said. ''There's enough here to warrant a visit. It's a phenomenon. And we've spawned two other centers.''</p>
        <p>John Hiden, of Hiden Galleries on Canal Street, who formerly had a booth at the Antique and Artisan Center, said he's been collecting since he was 6 years old. ''I picked garbage,'' said Mr. Hiden. ''Gradually over time the quality went up.''</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Hiden, who also gained experience working for Braswell Antiques, an auction house in Norwalk, collects American and Continental furniture, lighting, mirrors and decorative accessories.</p>
        <p>''The Antique and Artisan Center was the pioneer megacenter here,'' Mr. Hiden acknowledged. ''they put the area on the map.'' Hiden Galleries has 65 dealers in 16,000 square feet of a former laminations factory that Mr. Hiden gutted, stripped and painted, adding classical columns to create architectural interest.</p>
        <p>Debbie Schwartz, 28, who has opened the latest and largest of this hub, the Stamford Antiques Center, said for her it started in the carriage. ''I'm a third-generation antiques dealer. My grandparents sold Tiffany lamps, my parents were called 'second generation antiques.' '' And her mother, Jeri Schwartz, has written books on antiques, is a columnist for Country Living magazine and a licensed appraiser. Ms. Schwartz  sold her mail-order auction catalogue business last January in order to start this venture.</p>
        <p>The one-time factory, originally Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing Company, retains its sense of history with pillars and a sawtoothed roof with hundreds of skylights. The ceiling is painted burgundy, walls candlelight white, concrete floors honey-colored, the colors compliments of Gordon McCunis and Jay Kobrin of Micunis Designs, interior designers who have taken a booth to display fabrics, pillows, paintings and furniture. Before the opening, Ms. Schwartz said, the two dealers' showcase collection of brassware (from 25-cent picture hooks to a set of eight 1820's tie backs at $4,000) was ''causing a commotion.''</p>
        <p>Two outer aisles are filled with dealers' booths, chandeliers suspended from the ceiling stretching the length of one aisle into infinity. A center aisle is devoted to eye-stopping showcases of museum-quality antiques like jeweled Faberge-type picture frames.</p>
        <p>''We have high end up to Tiffany lamps and then linen for $10,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ''We display jewelry, silver, blue and white porcelain, samplers, every single century furniture. You name it, we have it.</p>
        <p>''Antiques dealers don't always come for one place but will make time for three. They can spend the day. This is antique heaven.''</p>
