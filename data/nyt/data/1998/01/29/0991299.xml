        <p>The State of the Union address appears to have bolstered the American public's view that President Clinton can continue to govern effectively and accomplish policy goals, but the public remains divided on the issues surrounding accusations of an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, according to several polls conducted immediately after the President's speech.</p>
        <p>Support for the job Mr. Clinton is doing increased in a poll conducted by CBS News. But Presidential job ratings tend to receive a bounce in polls taken immediately after a State of the Union address.</p>
        <p>The polls also found Mr. Clinton's morals and honesty to be viewed more positively. For example, the Gallup Organization conducted polls before and after the speech with the same group of people. Before Mr. Clinton's address, only 35 percent said he set a good moral example for the nation, and 61 percent said he did not. After the speech, opinion was more evenly divided: 49 percent said the President set a good moral example and 47 percent said he set a poor one.</p>
        <p>These findings and other survey results need to be viewed in the context of limits of these types of polls, which are typically quick and taken minutes after a specific event. For example, only the opinions of people who are home during a short period of time are measured.</p>
        <p>CBS News asked whether assertions of infidelity and obstruction of justice would interfere with Mr. Clinton's ability to do his job effectively. On Monday night, 51 percent said those accusations would interfere with his ability to govern effectively; 46 percent said they would not interfere. But after the speech that impression changed as well: 41 percent said he would be impeded, while 58 percent said he would not.</p>
        <p>But there appears to be no real change in the public's view of whether there is any truth in the accusations that Mr. Clinton had an affair with the 21-year-old intern. In NBC polls both before and after the speech, nearly 40 percent said they thought Mr. Clinton did have an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. About 30 percent continued to say that the accusations were untrue. The rest offered no opinion.</p>
        <p>NBC and ABC each polled random samples of adults by telephone immediately after the speech, finding that about 6 in 10 had watched the speech. The NBC poll includes the views of 405 adults and the ABC poll is based on 528 adults. Gallup called back 488 adults who had previously been polled, and re-interviewed the 400 who had watched the speech. CBS News recruited a sample of the public to watch the speech, and 843 participants called an 800 number to respond to questions after the speech.</p>
        <p>The margin of sampling error for all of the nationwide polls was plus or minus 4 or 5 percentage points. In addition, polls conducted entirely in one night introduce additional error.</p>
