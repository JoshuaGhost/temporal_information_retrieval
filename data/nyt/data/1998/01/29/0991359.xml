        <p>The Year of the Tiger made a quiet entrance in Chinatown yesterday, with residents and merchants blaming the Giuliani administration's ban on firecrackers for keeping revelers away.</p>
        <p>Streets that were normally vibrant in the past during the Chinese New Year celebration were noticeably empty for most of yesterday, even as the traditional lion dance groups wended their way through the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I've seen funerals that are more festive than this,'' said Larry Lau, an advertising designer who grew up in Chinatown.</p>
        <p>Instead of packing every inch of the sidewalk and lingering for hours, spectators stayed just long enough to catch a glimpse of the dancers. By 1:30 P.M., a small crowd of spectators remained on Mott Street, but other busy streets, like Bayard and Mulberry, were empty of spectators.</p>
        <p>The business climate was equally quiet. In a break from previous years, only a handful of stores and restaurants on Mulberry and Bayard remained open yesterday. More than half the businesses on Mott Street, one of the busiest streets in the neighborhood, were closed.</p>
        <p>''I've worked here for 14 years and I've never seen so many stores closed on the same day,'' said Peter Yun, a reporter for Sing Tao Daily, a Chinese-language newspaper.</p>
        <p>It was the second year in which firecrackers were banned by Mr. Giuliani. In previous years, the city's ban was not enforced, allowing the traditional use of firecrackers on the Chinese New Year to proceed.</p>
        <p>Inspector Thomas M. Chan, the commander of Chinatown's Fifth Precinct, said the streets had become a lot safer since the ban.</p>
        <p>''Usually, one or two people are injured each year by fireworks,'' Inspector Chan said. ''But no one has been hurt in the last two years.''</p>
        <p>While many residents in Chinatown said they supported the ban, they also supported a request by two community groups to hold a controlled firecracker display during the celebration.</p>
        <p>But Jack Deacy, a mayoral spokesman, said the city denied the request because the groups did not agree on a location recommended by the city until Monday. He said that the city would not have been able to evaluate safety in such a short time.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a civil rights group released a statement criticizing the Giuliani administration for what it called the administration's lack of respect for the Chinese culture.</p>
        <p>''The use of fireworks on the Chinese New Year has been part of Chinese ritual and tradition for many thousands of years, and it is a custom the city should respect,'' said Rabbi Marc Schneier, the president of the group, the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding.</p>
        <p>And last night in SoHo, an artist, Tery Fugate-Wilcox, held a minute-long display of firecrackers to coincide with the Chinese New Year. But Mr. Fugate-Wilcox said he was stopped by the police from also presenting a lion dance during the display outside the Fulcrum Gallery on Broome Street.</p>
        <p>The firecrackers, which were placed in a container and were set off to splatter paint onto a canvas, were part of a series of works by the artist that employed small explosions. Mr. Fugate-Wilcox said he had obtained a special-effects permit from the Fire Department for the series.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fugate-Wilcox said that he intended to donate the artwork, ''China Red,'' in protest, to Mayor Giuliani.</p>
