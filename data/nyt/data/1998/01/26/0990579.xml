      <abstract>
        <p>Several Internet sites are devoted to World's Fairs of past, particularly those held in New York in 1939-40 and 1964-65 (M)</p>

        <p>It has been more than a quarter-century since the last New York World's Fair closed up shop on a former ash heap in Queens. Precious little of it remains in Flushing Meadows -- just the Unisphere and a few other structures in varying states of decay.</p>
        <p>But the 1964-65 fair lives on on the World Wide Web, as does its precursor, the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, and other grand expositions.

        <p>It has been more than a quarter-century since the last New York World's Fair closed up shop on a former ash heap in Queens. Precious little of it remains in Flushing Meadows -- just the Unisphere and a few other structures in varying states of decay.</p>
        <p>But the 1964-65 fair lives on on the World Wide Web, as does its precursor, the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, and other grand expositions. And the fairs' poorer cousins, amusement parks, are well represented too, with sites devoted to defunct parks like Coney Island in Brooklyn, Freedomland in the Bronx, Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey and Boblo Island near Detroit.</p>
        <p>These sites are lovingly created and maintained by aficionados, and largely devoid of commercialism. To tour them is to rekindle memories of sheer wonder (in the case of world's fairs) and sheer terror (in the case of amusement parks). In the vernacular of Disney, they are definitely ''E'' tickets.</p>
        <p>There are two good sites dedicated to the 1964-65 New York fair. Both offer extensive information about the fair's 140 pavilions, which ranged from an elaborate re-creation of a Belgian village to a house built of Formica. One site, by Jeffrey Stanton, an amateur historian and author in Venice, Calif., features clickable maps of the fair grounds, plenty of photographs, and articles on the construction of the fair and the technology it showcased. (The latter offers the delicious tidbit that the fair organizers asked the Atomic Energy Commission to build a mobile nuclear reactor for the event. The commission declined.)</p>
        <p>The Web is a generational thing, of course, so perhaps it is not surprising that people with memories of the 1939-40 New York fair have fewer options. The best site consists largely of a personal essay in which the author points out that he created the site after finding nothing about the fair on the Web. The site has links to other articles, book reviews and photographs, and serves as a kind of gathering place for others who fondly remember the Trylon and Perisphere, the fair's symbols.</p>
        <p>The granddaddy of world's fairs, at least in the United States, was the World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to the New World. It is represented by two sites, one of which details everything from the number of tickets sold (21.5 million) to the cost of various forms of transportation (a sedan chair, borne by native Turks, was 75 cents an hour). There is extensive information about the fair's great innovations, including the Ferris wheel (invented for the event by George Ferris) and the Midway Plaisance, the central group of paying attractions that helped make the fair a financial success.</p>
        <p>The midway concept was so successful that it became the basis for most American amusement parks until the Disneyland era, after World War II. And some of those now-silent parks can be found on the Web.</p>
        <p>The site for Boblo Island, which closed in 1993 after 95 years of entertaining Michigan and Ontario residents, consists solely of a long essay. But the history is fascinating and detailed, describing, among other things, the origin of the name (it is a corruption of Bois Blanc) and several unfortunate incidents, including the time in 1941 when 3,000 women and children were stranded on the island for most of a night because of a lack of ferry boats.</p>
        <p>There are references to Coney Island, once the grandest of America's amusement areas (it was actually three separate parks), all over the Web. The most elaborate site is one created by Mr. Stanton, who has made something of a specialty in researching old fairs and parks (he has sites for Expo '67 and the Venice, Calif., amusement piers as well).</p>
        <p>As Mr. Stanton's site painfully details, Coney Island is just a shell of its former self: aside from the Cyclone coaster, there is little left. Two other parks in the New York area -- Palisades, on the cliffs overlooking the Hudson, and Freedomland U.S.A. in the Bronx -- have disappeared completely, except on the Web.</p>
        <p>Palisades has its own historical society, which maintains a Web site that, while still under construction, features a history of the park and some sound files, including the famous radio jingle (''Palisades has the rides, Palisades has the fun, come on over'').</p>
        <p>Freedomland's site is more extensive, with plenty of photographs and maps of the park, which was laid out in the shape of the United States. There is also a listing of where some of Freedomland's rides are today (the Tornado ride, for example, migrated to a park in Lake George, N.Y.) and even a link to Co-op City, the vast housing project that rose from the park's ashes.</p>
        <p>Even Disneyland, while obviously not defunct, has a retro site of sorts. Cleverly titled Yesterland, it features descriptions of attractions that have been phased out at the California park over the years. It also includes a discussion of Disneyland's old coupon policy, in which a separate ticket was required for each ride or attraction, an ''A'' ticket for the simplest ride to an ''E'' ticket for the most elaborate or thrilling.</p>
        <p>Disneyland, of course, begat Disney World in Florida, the crown jewel of what have come to be known as theme parks. But as one other site shows, not all Florida entertainment ventures turned to gold. ''Florida's Forgotten Tourist Attractions'' describes many that came and went, like the Honey Bee Factory, a glorified observation hive in Fort Myers, and the Anirama near Miami, a museum of animated figures that was soon eclipsed by Disney. Perhaps the weirdest was Weapons of the World, near Cypress Gardens, where in the 1950's visitors could use modern copies of old weapons ''on ranges designed to simulate actual historic and native conditions.'' It went out of business in the 1960's, a victim, it appears, of the peace movement.</p>
