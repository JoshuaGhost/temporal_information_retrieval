        <p>A Hasidic man and his son who said that the New York City Police Department did nothing to protect them while an angry crowd beat them during the 1991 racial unrest in Crown Heights have received $200,000 in a settlement with the city, officials confirmed last night.</p>
        <p>The settlement is the first resulting from a Federal lawsuit in which the neighborhood's Jewish community accused city officials of failing to protect them from the violence that began when a car driven by a Hasidic man struck and killed a 7-year-old black child.</p>
        <p>The incident triggered four days of violence and soured relations between blacks and Jews. It also became an issue in the 1993 mayoral race, helping Rudolph W. Giuliani to defeat Mayor David N. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>In 1992, a group of Hasidic Jews filed a Federal lawsuit against the city, Mr. Dinkins and former Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown. In November, Judge Frederic Block of United States District Court in Brooklyn said Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Brown had acted in an official capacity and were immune from lawsuits.</p>
        <p>The judge left open the matter of the lawsuit against the city. The $200,000 settlement with Isaac Bitton, and his son, Yechiel -- which apparently was approved last month but not reported until yesterday by The Daily News -- was the first.</p>
        <p>There are still several plaintiffs in the case, including relatives of Yankel Rosenbaum, the scholar who was stabbed to death during the violence. A trial is scheduled for April.</p>
        <p>Last night, Dwight Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, said that the elder Bitton received $125,000, and his son, $75,000. According to a state report on the unrest, the elder Mr. Bitton was returning home from work with his 12-year-old on a hot day in August 1991 when a police officer told them it was safe to walk down Schenectady Avenue.</p>
        <p>But the Bittons were met by 50 people armed with bricks, stones and belts, according to the report. Mr. Bitton was struck in the head with a brick and fell on his son to protect him. Police officers standing sentinel at both ends of the street failed to intervene, Mr. Bitton said.</p>
        <p>The Bittons were not available to comment last night, said someone who answered the phone at their home in Brooklyn. Their lawyer, Chana Sklar Israel, could not be reached for comment.</p>
