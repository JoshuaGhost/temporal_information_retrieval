        <p>Aetna U.S. Healthcare said yesterday that it would charge extra for coverage for in vitro fertilization and other advanced reproductive treatments in places where Aetna had included the procedure as part of its basic coverage. U.S. Healthcare, a subsidiary of Aetna Inc., is a pioneer in reproductive coverage; it began offering in vitro fertilization in 1995.</p>
        <p>Aetna said last Friday that it would drop advanced reproductive coverage on April 1. Couples who needed in vitro fertilization had favored the company's health plans, adding to its costs. Many insurance companies already offer reproductive coverage as an option that employers can buy.</p>
