        <p>Like so many other parents, they sent out a birth notice: ''Mario and Jane Simeone proudly announce the birth of their new arrivals!'' It listed the names of their triplets, the birth weights, lengths, and birth date: June 21, 1997.</p>

        <p>Like so many other parents, they sent out a birth notice: ''Mario and Jane Simeone proudly announce the birth of their new arrivals!'' It listed the names of their triplets, the birth weights, lengths, and birth date: June 21, 1997.</p>
        <p>There were also color photographs, which conveyed what the words could not: Amber Raquel in the yellow light of a neonatal incubator, the word ''caution'' visible on its side; Cheyenne Barbara with tubes sprouting from chest, legs, arms and hands; Mario Victor with a ventilator tube taped to his mouth.</p>
        <p>Next to Amber's photograph was another vital statistic: ''deceased June 24, 1997.'' Next to Cheyenne's, it read ''deceased July 6, 1997.'' By the time the birth announcements were mailed, only Mario Jr. was still alive.</p>
        <p>The story of the Simeones is a melancholy counterpoint to the story of the McCaugheys, the Iowa couple who captivated a nation in November when Mrs. McCaughey gave birth to the first living septuplets. Yet in some ways, doctors and parents say, the risks and heartaches of the Simeones are as real with multiple births as the McCaugheys' medical triumph. Indeed, faced with continued cheerful publicity about the McCaugheys -- doctors recently announced that the septuplets were progressing well and set to go home at the end of January -- some parents feel compelled to balance the picture by disclosing their own, more painful experiences.</p>
        <p>''We wanted kids and we fought to have kids,'' said Tina Hammer, who gave birth to quadruplets, only to see one baby die and others wracked with problems like blindness and the inability to breathe on their own. ''No regrets. I absolutely don't want people to pity us. But I still want people to know it doesn't always have a happy ending.''</p>
        <p>As more couples try ever-evolving infertility treatments, births of triplets, quadruplets and even quintuplets are becoming more common. Still, while medical advancements have clearly helped some of these pregnancies produce healthy children, others continue to be fraught with problems.</p>
        <p>''Our bodies are not made to carry that many bodies,'' said Dr. Barbara Luke, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Michigan Medical School. ''Inducing a three-  or four-fetal pregnancy in a woman that was infertile -- it's a bad situation on top of a bad situation. You can't fool Mother Nature.''</p>
        <p>Between 1980 and 1994, the latest year for which statistics are available, nearly 1 of every 10 of the 37,514 triplets, quadruplets and other ''higher-order multiples'' died in their first year, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
        <p>Multiple pregnancies are also more likely to fail. A woman carrying multiples for at least 20 weeks -- about half the duration of a normal pregnancy -- is five times likelier to lose the babies before they are born.</p>
        <p>Of those that survive, about 92 percent of triplets and other multiples are born prematurely and below normal birth weight, which can lead to health and developmental problems. One study found that triplets were twice as likely to develop cerebral palsy, blindness, mental retardation or seizure disorders as single babies born.</p>
        <p>For parents involved in these pregnancies, the frenzy of emotions is almost beyond description. Many have spent anguished years trying to conceive children, only to be catapulted onto another kind of roller coaster once their babies are born.</p>
        <p>Joy and Sorrow Follow Medical Miracle</p>
        <p>On the one hand, they are flushed with the sense that the mere survival of these palm-sized infants is a blessing. On the other, they must face the prospect of lifelong problems for their children. And those who have lost one or more babies find themselves pierced with sorrow over children they hardly knew and may have held for the first time only as they were dying.</p>
        <p>''This is not the kind of thing that people picture when they go into this,'' said Jean Kollantai, director of the Center for Loss in Multiple Births, a support network. ''I wish that everyone involved with multiples would be required to sit on my phone for a day.''</p>
        <p>The Simeones, both 27, had tried for six years to become pregnant, lacing their lives into the anxious, wistful world of infertility treatments, from frozen embryo transfers to intra-uterine insemination. They scraped to afford what insurance would not cover, filling prescriptions for fertility drugs just over the border in Mexico, for example, because they were five times cheaper.</p>
        <p>But despite careful medical care and Mrs. Simeone's dutiful efforts to help the pregnancy go smoothly, problems forced her to deliver 15 weeks early. Ultimately, she could only sing to the girls as they died in her arms. Her son was hospitalized all summer, needing oxygen at home for weeks.</p>
        <p>Surviving Baby A Reminder of Grief</p>
        <p>When the Simeones placed their daughters' ashes in a wooden urn, they left space on the engraving plate for Mario Jr., so afraid that he too would die.</p>
        <p>''After he came home all the emotions started hitting me with the girls,'' Mrs. Simeone said recently in this cactus-dotted satellite of Tucson. ''Having him around was a constant reminder of them. I would hold him and then I would hold the girls' urn 'cause I wanted to hold them all together. People keep saying I should be thankful for the one. I am thankful for the one. But I can't forget about the two.''</p>
        <p>Experts on multiple births say some of the pregnancies falter because some doctors fail to treat them as high-risk cases needing specialists, and some women are not counseled about bed rest, nutrition and monitoring for premature contractions.</p>
        <p>But even in well-monitored pregnancies like Mrs. Simeone's and Mrs. Hammer's, the strain of carrying so many fetuses can make for hard consequences.</p>
        <p>At the front door of their home in Fountain, Colo., Tina and Jerome Hammer have tacked up a sign.</p>
        <p>''POSTED!!!,'' it reads. ''If you have been around anyone OR are 'just getting over' any of the following: cold, flu, chicken pox, strep throat, or ANYTHING ELSE CONTAGIOUS, sniffles, cough, fever, stuffy or runny nose, sore throat (of ANY kind), chills, diarrhea, vomiting OR stomach ache, unexplained rash, YOU MUST NOT VISIT!!!!''</p>
        <p>Those healthy enough to come in are begged to ''remove shoes,'' and ''wash your hands upon entering -- ALWAYS!''</p>
        <p>Spelling out the desperation behind the capital letters and exclamation points, the sign continues: ''Remember, our babies were VERY early -- they need extra special care!''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hammer, 24, became pregnant with quadruplets after months of trying to overcome damaged fallopian tubes and an ovary.</p>
        <p>She was conscientious, monitoring her uterus for premature contractions, taking drugs to stop preterm labor, staying in bed. Still, she went into labor in April after only 23 weeks, when the babies weighed about a pound each, their eyes were still fused shut, and their bones could be seen because their skin, beet red, was missing its final layer.</p>
        <p>One of the four girls, Aubrey Marie, was taken off life support at five days old because a ''brain bleed'' had caused irreparable damage. She was so tiny that her parents had to buy doll clothes for her burial.</p>
        <p>Another daughter, Jorian Lea, is blind in one eye and remains hospitalized after eight months, breathing only through a hole in her trachea hooked up to a ventilator. She will come home once eight nurses are found to provide round-the-clock home care, needed ''because she can't cry, so I can't hear her,'' said Mrs. Hammer.</p>
        <p>McKenzie Kay is hooked up to an oxygen tank, and soon after birth her retinas detached, her lenses were removed and she is legally blind. The healthiest so far is Kendra Dawn, having weathered blood transfusions, lung problems, infections and eye surgeries. Like the others, though, she is still at risk for cerebral palsy and developmental problems.</p>
        <p>''I just live every day in the day,'' Mrs. Hammer said as she whisked McKenzie to a quick bath, threading the long oxygen tube behind like a tail, a motion that is second nature now. ''In the hospital, I just looked for the milestones for that day. I looked for them to turn down the ventilator settings, for weight gain, for an increase in feedings.''</p>
        <p>Fertility Treatments Difficult to Control</p>
        <p>These days, many fertility doctors make efforts to avoid multiple pregnancies. Drug cycles can be interrupted if a woman makes too many eggs and in vitro fertilization can be limited to implant fewer embryos.  But even a conservative approach can have unexpected results.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Dawn Solesi-Gross, 30, and her husband Mike, of Bel Air, Md., chose to implant six eggs, a number they and their doctors considered prudent based on the fertilization rate of her eggs in the laboratory. To their doctors' shock, five were fertilized. But 21 1/2 weeks later, she was forced to deliver the quintuplets -- so early that doctors gave them to the parents to hold as they died.</p>
        <p>''They would hand me a baby,'' Ms. Solesi-Gross said. ''Then a contraction would come and they would say you have to start pushing and I would hand the baby to my husband, and on again until all five came out. It's unexplainable, what that's like.''</p>
        <p>The Hammers had been told there was a 1 percent chance all four embryos they implanted would take.</p>
        <p>But once they did, they, like Ms. Solesi-Gross, could not accept what might have been the best medical choice, to abort one or more in a process called selective reduction.</p>
        <p>Many parents of multiples feel that other people don't or can't understand their emotional carousel of joy, grief and fear.</p>
        <p>''People say a lot of stupid things, like 'At least you have three,' '' Mrs. Hammer said.</p>
        <p>When Mario Jr. first came home, ''I was scared to death of him,'' Mrs. Simeone said. ''There was one day I called my O B and I was bawling my eyes out. I said 'I'm scared to death I'm going to kill him.' If he dies here and I didn't notice a color change or something, then it's my fault.''</p>
        <p>While she says her husband copes by throwing himself into his job at Radio Shack, Mrs. Simeone, a former financial analyst for an H.M.O., has sought counseling and takes Prozac to help ease her sorrow so she can enjoy her son.</p>
        <p>A dedicated Pentecostal, Mrs. Simeone is also facing a religious crisis, sharpened, in spite of herself, when the McCaugheys repeatedly credited their pregnancy's success to God.</p>
        <p>''After what I've been through, I just can't believe,'' Mrs. Simeone said, adding, ''Maybe He does miracles for other people, but not for me.''</p>
        <p>She still attends church, but left one night after the pastor's daughter asked if she'd heard the last septuplet was off the ventilator.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad it turned out as well as it did,'' said Mrs. Simeone. ''But it makes me feel like a failure.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Simeone finds commiseration on the internet, where there is a kind of on-line sorority for sharing experiences and disconcerting bits of knowledge, like the fact that taking photographs of babies who have just died to preserve their angelic images may prove disappointing, because the camera reveals bruises and discolorations that don't show up in the mind's eye.</p>
        <p>After the septuplet fanfare, Mrs. Simeone posted her story, hoping people won't ''go into a multiple pregnancy as blinded as I was.''</p>
        <p>Finding Some Comfort On the Internet</p>
        <p>On line, she met Tina Hammer, who joins internet support groups for everything from G-tubes (feeding tubes) to retinopathy of prematurity (an eye disease).</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hammer, a former sign-language teacher, even created a web site, the Mighty Mousies Home Page, with details of her fertility struggle, each quadruplet's medical journey, and photographs.</p>
        <p>The Hammers are throwing prodigious energy into making their daughters' lives as normal as possible. They have already begun learning Braille for McKenzie. Mrs. Hammer found time to dye tiny nylon stockings antique white for little velvet Christmas dresses. Mr. Hammer, a 26-year-old finance specialist in the Army, talks of unlimited potential: ''Just because McKenzie lost her sight does not mean she can't play baseball. We'll change the rules.''</p>
        <p>Every day, one parent travels 20 miles to Colorado Springs to see Jorian, sometimes with babies and oxygen tank in tow.</p>
        <p>The other night, Mr. Hammer drove through whirling snow to suction and clean around Jorian's tracheotomy tube.</p>
        <p>''I remember saying this isn't happening to me,'' he said quietly. ''But no one will ever hear me complain. I think it will actually make us better parents, everything we've gone through.''</p>
