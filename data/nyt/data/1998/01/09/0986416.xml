        <p>After being asked repeatedly why he had never attempted a quadruple jump in competition, Todd Eldredge launched one tonight during his long program at the Olympic trials. He fell hard on the quad toe, but he did not tumble out of first place as he won his fifth national title.</p>
        <p>Eldredge, 26, the 1996 world champion, completed the four necessary revolutions on the toe loop, but he landed with an awkward lean and dropped to the ice early in his four-and-a-half minute routine. But he is a thoroughbred, not a one-trick pony.</p>

        <p>After being asked repeatedly why he had never attempted a quadruple jump in competition, Todd Eldredge launched one tonight during his long program at the Olympic trials. He fell hard on the quad toe, but he did not tumble out of first place as he won his fifth national title.</p>
        <p>Eldredge, 26, the 1996 world champion, completed the four necessary revolutions on the toe loop, but he landed with an awkward lean and dropped to the ice early in his four-and-a-half minute routine. But he is a thoroughbred, not a one-trick pony.</p>
        <p>After reducing a second triple axel to two revolutions, Eldredge attempted the triple axel again and landed it flawlessly. The attempted quad appeared to sap him of some of his energy, but Eldredge still completed six triples over all and displayed his familiarly brilliant spins to take first place.</p>
        <p>''I skated well,'' Eldredge said. ''It's the first time I tried the quad. I had it on one foot; it was that close but I just fell. I'm happy to get a fifth title.''</p>
        <p>While all his top competitors for an Olympic gold medal -- Elvis Stojko of Canada and Ilya Kulik and Aleksei Yagudin of Russia -- have landed a quad in competition, the conservative Eldredge had preferred to rely on his completeness and consistency. No American has landed a quad.</p>
        <p>Eldredge's top rival at the trials, Michael Weiss, 21, of Fairfax, Va., also was determined to jump into history tonight, becoming the first American to land a quadruple jump and the first skater anywhere to land a quadruple lutz. Tonight, he attained great height but two-footed the quadruple lutz, then also two-footed a triple axel and a triple flip. His five clean triple jumps again were enough for second place and a trip with Eldredge to the Winter Olympics next month in Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <p>The fifth national title put Eldredge one ahead of both Brian Boitano and Scott Hamilton. He became the only American since the 1950's to win five American titles. Dick Button won seven over all, as did Sherwin Badger in the 1920's and 30's. What Eldredge now wants is the ultimate prize that Button, Boitano and Hamilton possess -- an Olympic gold medal.</p>
        <p>Eldredge won the votes of all judges in the short program on Tuesday. Tonight, skating to music from the movie ''Gettysburg,'' he won the favor of seven of nine judges.</p>
