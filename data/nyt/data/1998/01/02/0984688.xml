        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Dec. 28 front-page article says Vermont ''is singular in its commitment to integrating severely disabled students into regular classrooms.'' As a lawyer, I have represented such young people in Social Security disability claims and had to overcome the presumption in the disability regulations that a high school diploma meant that someone could read and write on a high school level. Though my clients had received regular diplomas, throughout their education they had had the one-on-one assistance of teacher assistants.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Dec. 28 front-page article says Vermont ''is singular in its commitment to integrating severely disabled students into regular classrooms.'' As a lawyer, I have represented such young people in Social Security disability claims and had to overcome the presumption in the disability regulations that a high school diploma meant that someone could read and write on a high school level. Though my clients had received regular diplomas, throughout their education they had had the one-on-one assistance of teacher assistants.</p>
        <p>One client told me that in addition to a high school diploma she had received a standard driver's license. When asked how she took the written test, since she could not read, she explained that someone had ''helped her.'' When asked how while driving she would read the signs, she answered, ''I don't know.''</p>
        <p>The Vermont Department of Vocational Rehabilitation helped the woman to obtain a part-time job, subsidized through incentives to private employers and one-on-one training by a state professional. After three weeks, she learned to place labels on merchandise. Although the state no longer provides a trainer, the employer provides a supportive supervisor.</p>
