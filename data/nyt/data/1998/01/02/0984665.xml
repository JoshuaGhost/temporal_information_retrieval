        <p>Many elected officials and VIP's shun blankets and some even shed their outer clothes despite cold weather during inauguration of NYC Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani (S)</p>

        <p>For many elected officials and other V.I.P.'s, it was not enough to just cast aside the blankets that awaited them on their chairs. In a display of New York bravado and hardiness, several even shed their outer clothes, if they wore them at all.</p>
        <p>The Mayor stepped on stage without an overcoat or gloves and did not put them on until he had finished his 35-minute speech. (His spokeswoman grudgingly admitted that he was wearing thermal leggings under his dark suit, but said he had made no other concessions to the cold.) Public Advocate Mark J. Green followed suit, doffing his coat to make his inaugural speech. And even Andrew Giuliani took his black leather gloves off and stuffed them into his pocket, the better to applaud his father.</p>

        <p>The Mayor stepped on stage without an overcoat or gloves and did not put them on until he had finished his 35-minute speech. (His spokeswoman grudgingly admitted that he was wearing thermal leggings under his dark suit, but said he had made no other concessions to the cold.) Public Advocate Mark J. Green followed suit, doffing his coat to make his inaugural speech. And even Andrew Giuliani took his black leather gloves off and stuffed them into his pocket, the better to applaud his father.</p>
        <p>Most in the crowd of 5,000 invited guests were more practical, donning ski hats and boasting of multiple thermal layers. But not everyone.</p>
        <p>Nick Economou, a retired 73-year-old machinist, wore nothing over his charcoal gray suit or on his hands or head. ''I don't use too many clothes,'' said Mr. Economou, who immigrated from Greece 41 years ago. ''I teach my body to stay warm.''</p>
        <p>Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, couldn't help but comment on the macho clothes-shedding. ''I just want to point out that I'm the only public official up here who kept his coat on all through the ceremony,'' he said. ''I might not have been the toughest, but maybe I'm . . . Oh, never mind.''</p>
        <p>And keeping the cold weather in mind, Mr. Hevesi said he had torn up the speech he intended to give and would instead give a brief summary. He jokingly said that those in the crowd who wanted a copy of his prepared speech should call his office.</p>
