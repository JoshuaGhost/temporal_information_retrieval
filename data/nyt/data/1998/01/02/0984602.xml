        <p>Rebels attacked a village and a military camp on the outskirts of the Burundian capital early this morning, killing at least 150 civilians and 10 soldiers in what officials described as the biggest rebel assault in that country in recent years, a senior military commander said.</p>

        <p>Rebels attacked a village and a military camp on the outskirts of the Burundian capital early this morning, killing at least 150 civilians and 10 soldiers in what officials described as the biggest rebel assault in that country in recent years, a senior military commander said.</p>
        <p>Col. Jean-Bosco Daradangwe,  head of security forces in Burundi, said his troops had found strong evidence that the rebel force included several hundred Hutu guerrillas from neighboring Rwanda, where Hutu insurgents have stepped up a campaign of terror over the last six months.</p>
        <p>The colonel said the rebel force that attacked today near the capital, Bujumbura, appeared to be the same as the one that massacred 300 refugees at Mudende, about 120 miles  away in northwestern Rwanda, on Dec. 10.</p>
        <p>In both countries, the Government is controlled by the Tutsi, an ethnic minority, and the rebels are from the majority Hutu group. Colonel Daradangwe said the Rwandan insurgents had apparently joined forces with the Burundian rebels, who have been fighting since 1993 to topple the military government in Bujumbura and reinstall a democratically elected government.</p>
        <p>''The information we have now on the ground is that the group came from Rwanda, and its the same group that attacked Mudende two or three weeks ago,'' Colonel Daradangwe said in a telephone interview. ''The problem is now a regional problem.''</p>
        <p>The colonel said the rebel group of about 2,000 men attacked the village of Rukaramu, about a mile from Bujumbura's international airport,  about 4 A.M.</p>
        <p>The attackers, armed with machine-guns, grenades and traditional weapons, slaughtered 150 civilians in the village, both Tutsi and Hutu. The victims were killed after they refused to accompany the guerrillas, officials said.</p>
        <p>About a half-hour later, the rebel force assaulted a military barracks at the airport, which is six miles from Bujumbura. Officials said the rebels apparently were trying to seize the airport, but were repelled after a 30-minute firefight in which 10 soldiers and dozens of rebels were killed, he said.</p>
        <p>Diplomats in Bujumbura said heavy mortar and machine-gun fire  could be heard in the vicinity of the airport starting about 4 A.M. The fighting lasted for about five hours, they said. The capital itself remained calm throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Over the next few hours, Government troops pursued the rebels through the flat farmland ringing the capital city. In a fighting retreat, the rebels moved east and tried to cross the Rusizi River into Congo near the town of Kamanyola. Government troops turned them back, though, and they fled northward toward Rwanda.</p>
        <p>By nightfall, the rebels were moving into the mountainous northern province of Cibitoke, heading for a large forest that straddles Rwanda and Burundi. At least 50 rebels had been killed in the day's fighting, officials said.</p>
        <p>About 30 rebels were captured during today's fighting, and most of them were identified as Rwandans, Colonel Daradangwe said. In addition, officials said the commander of the attackers, Samuel Byiringiro,  was killed in the fighting and was found with documents on his body suggesting he is a former colonel in the Rwandan Army, officials said.</p>
        <p>Jean Luc Ndizeye, the Burundian Ambassador in Britain, said that the guerrillas did not seem to know the terrain well, and that survivors of the attack reported that the rebels spoke the Rwandan dialect rather than the Burundian tongue.</p>
        <p>Documents taken from the captured guerrillas announced they belonged to a rebel brigade under a new organization called the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy, Mr. Ndizeye said.</p>
        <p>Colonel Daradangwe said some of the soldiers carried propaganda similar to leaflets found at the massacre site in Rwanda two weeks ago. ''This genocidal propaganda saying we have to overthrow the Tutsi is the same propaganda that they found in Mudende,'' he said.</p>
