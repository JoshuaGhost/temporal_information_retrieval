        <p>WHEN Governor George E. Pataki vetoed a bill last fall that would have allowed the Town of East Hampton to impose a 2 percent transfer tax on real estate, town officials were dismayed and environmental groups were furious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, they said, had denied the East End of Long Island a new land preservation technique at a time when it was desperately needed.</p>
        <p>Now a coalition of environmental, business and civic groups, backed by local elected officials, is promoting a revised bill that would widen the transfer tax to other East End towns, subject to residents' approval.</p>
        <p>The groups said the tax revenues would finance town land banks that local officials could draw on to protect farms and open spaces threatened by second-home and commercial development.</p>
        <p>They said it would yield a combined total of about $6 million a year in the five East End towns of East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold.</p>
        <p>The amount is far less than the more than $300 million some experts estimate would be needed to protect targeted parcels on the North and South Forks, where farms and open areas comprise about one-third of the land.</p>
        <p>But environmental groups and planners said the tax would complement other preservation methods. These include publicly financed land purchases, development rights purchases, transfer of development rights, conservation easements and zoning. They warned that unless steps were taken quickly the East End would continue rapidly to lose its rural characteristics, and with that its agricultural heritage and resort appeal.</p>
        <p>Transfer taxes have been used successfully in Nantucket and other resort areas, they said, to preserve enough scenic and ecologically important land to soften the visual and environmental effects of new development while also insuring that land values remain high.</p>
        <p>The East End tax would be collected on house sales of more than $250,000 and on farm or open land sales of more than $100,000. The tax would be paid by the purchaser.</p>
        <p>Sales under these threshold amounts and agricultural land sold to farmers would be exempted. Voters in each town would have to approve the tax in local referendums next November before it could be imposed.</p>
        <p>The East End towns comprise the eastern third of Long Island, the region's least developed and most resort-oriented and agricultural area. Residents of the towns have repeatedly shown support for land preservation in referendum votes and in their voting patterns.</p>
        <p>The proposed transfer tax will be a matter of interest for Long Island when the state Legislature reconvenes early this month.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele, Jr., Republican of Bridgehampton, and Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Port Jefferson, were to introduce companion bills early in the session that would grant towns the authority to collect the tax. They were also sponsors of the earlier measure vetoed by Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The influence of the Long Island delegation to Albany has been weakened in recent years by the retirement of the former Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Muttontown, who lost the leadership post to Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer.</p>
        <p>More recently, the Senate transportation committee chairman, Norman J. Levy, Republican of Merrick, another influential member of the delegation, has been seriously ill.</p>
        <p>But the revised bill, backers said, will probably receive the same bipartisan support afforded the first bill.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki said he vetoed that bill because it was limited to East Hampton. His veto also reflected last-minute opposition to the bill from the Long Island Farm Bureau, which acted after a provision exempting land sold to a farmer was stricken from the Senate version.</p>
        <p>The revised bill restores the exemption, overcoming the bureau's objection. It also makes the transfer tax specific to the East End towns in an attempt to overcome objections of realtors' groups including the New York State Board of Realtors. Those groups wanted assurances that the transfer tax would not be imposed in other parts of the state for any of a number of public purposes.</p>
        <p>The supporters, called the East End Land Bank Coalition, said the revised version also met Mr. Pataki's other objections by including other East End towns. They have called on Mr. Pataki to pledge his support.</p>
        <p>Elected officials in all of the towns except Riverhead have said they support the measure. In Riverhead, a newly elected Democratic town board has yet to make a formal commitment.</p>
        <p>Backers also include realtors and local builders who support the transfer tax as a way of upholding land values dependent on scenic surroundings.</p>
        <p>Other realtors' and builders' groups such as the Long Island Builders Institute have criticized what they have called a ''welcome stranger'' tax that would be levied on newcomers. They said land purchases using public money and other methods of preservation were fairer.</p>
        <p>Tax proceeds would go to the town in which the transaction occurred. The money would then be available for land preservation programs ranging from outright purchase to purchase of development rights.</p>
        <p>Local elected officials, planners and environmental groups continue to search for new approaches. Some advocates of open space have said that zoning that restricts development is the least costly and most effective method, but East End officials have feared the potential cost when developers and land owners challenge restrictive zoning in the courts.</p>
        <p>Towns also face potential liabilities when they seek to stop or delay development that current zoning allows. Last month a State Supreme Court Justice ordered Southamptn to pay $13 million to landowners who said that the town blocked them from developing a 272-acre parcel of pine barrens zoned for industrial use.</p>
        <p>Another of the towns, Riverhead, has made several zoning changes in recent years that allowed for more intensive commercial development in previously open land.</p>
        <p>In one current development in the Riverhead hamlet of Northville, a large section of farmland has been bulldozed for a new golf course in an area that had been farmed for more than 300 years.</p>
        <p>An analysis by the Suffolk County Department of Planning showed the number of housing units on the South Fork had increased from about 21,000 in 1960 to 55,000 in 1997. Under current zoning it would increase to 68,000 by 2020, according to the analysis.</p>
        <p>On the North Fork and Shelter Island, the study showed, the number of dwellings increased from 16,000 in 1960 to 28,000 in 1997. It would increase to 35,000 by 2020 under current zoning.</p>
        <p>From 1960 to 1997, the study showed, the amount of vacant land on the East End declined from more than 120,000 acres to about 60,000 acres.</p>
