        <p>The world has not seen much of President Clinton in the past few days, as he and his family have been holed up in a luxurious villa on secluded Magens Bay on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p>But a television crew on a rented boat managed to get close enough on Friday to catch the President on the beach trying to teach his new dog, Buddy, some old tricks.</p>
        <p>A Labrador retriever might be expected to take naturally to the game of fetch. But time and again, Mr. Clinton threw a toy bone down the beach and Buddy just did not get it. The dog would pick up the bone and go running off in the wrong direction.</p>
        <p>Not unlike some Democrats in Congress, one White House aide noted wryly.</p>
        <p>Promoting the Peace Corps</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton took a few minutes off from doing nothing on Friday to tape his weekly radio address, which was broadcast today. He announced that he would ask Congress to approve a substantial increase in financing for the Peace Corps. Mr. Clinton wants to put 10,000 Peace Corps workers overseas by the year 2000; there are currently about 6,500 Peace Corps workers in the field.</p>
        <p>''In a world where we're more and more affected by what happens beyond our borders, we have to work harder to overcome the divisions that undermine the integrity and quality of life around the world, as well as here at home,'' the President said. ''Strengthening the Peace Corps, giving more Americans opportunities to serve in humanity's cause, is both an opportunity and an obligation we should seize in 1998.''</p>
        <p>The Administration's budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1 includes a $48 million increase in the Peace Corps' budget, 21 percent more than current levels, in a year when overall discretionary domestic spending will rise only 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Mark Gearan, director of the Peace Corps, said today that interest in the Peace Corps is growing, with more than 150,000 people contacting the agency last year about serving in the agency.</p>
        <p>''The popular perception about Generation X -- that young people are slackers with little motivation -- is a myth. Every day we see more and more young Americans who want to volunteer and make a difference in the lives of other people,'' Mr. Gearan said.</p>
        <p>New Year's Eve Tradition</p>
        <p>The President began his New Year's vacation in the customary way, with a stop at the Renaissance Weekend gathering in Hilton Head, S.C.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and family spent New Year's Eve in a Hyatt Hotel ballroom with 1,500 of his friends, seated in a stuffed armchair taking questions from the audience.</p>
        <p>Most of the queries were about matters of high policy, from Bosnia to health care, participants said.</p>
        <p>But 10-year-old Teddy Siebert, the son of Thomas Siebert, Ambassador to Switzerland, lightened the mood, asking the President if Mr. Siebert had been a nerd in college.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who attended Georgetown University with the elder Siebert, answered, ''You know, I really didn't think he was, but I know you want me to say 'yes.' So, yes.''</p>
        <p>A little after 10 that evening, an aide took Mr. Clinton aside to inform him of the death of Michael L. Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy, in a skiing accident.</p>
        <p>The President was visibly shocked by Mr. Kennedy's death, but did not share the news with the crowd. He slipped away shortly after midnight to make a condolence call to the family, which was in Aspen, Colo.</p>
        <p>Perfect Weather on Island</p>
        <p>One banner over the main highway of St. Thomas welcomed the President's family to the Virgin Islands, but otherwise the Clintons attracted little local notice.</p>
        <p>Radio station WSTA on St. Thomas delivered a special greeting to the President in its morning newscast on Friday, between the weather (84 degrees and partly sunny) and a report on the Virgin Islands' finances (a deficit of $570 million but no payless paydays in 1997).</p>
        <p>''Welcome back to St. Thomas. Here's your special report,'' the announcer said. ''America is O.K. today. El Nino is drenching California but F.E.M.A. is ready if it's bad. The weather in Washington is terrible. Not much better in Little Rock. It's good to have you on St. Thomas, where the weather is perfect and everyone is hospitable.</p>
        <p>''Now you roll over and take another snooze,'' the soothing voice said. ''Take in a round of golf and take the rest of the day off.''</p>
        <p>The President did just that. He returns to Washington Sunday night.</p>
