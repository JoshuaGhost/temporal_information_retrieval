        <p>SINCE it usually takes a while for the concert season to return to full speed after the holiday break, the annual series at the New Canaan Library in January called Notes in Mid Winter is especially welcome.</p>
        <p>This afternoon at 2, the cellist Allison Eldredge and the pianist Yoshie Akimoto begin the cycle playing Scarlatti, Chopin, Brahms and more. Next Sunday, the library is host to Musica Plenti, the 13-member vocal ensemble that promises to feature works by American composers but also threatens to add P. D. Q. Bach to its roster.</p>
        <p>The pianist Blair McMillen plans works by Mozart, Chopin, Debussy, Copland and William Bolcom for his Jan. 18 recital; the series concludes on Jan. 25 with music in the Klezical tradition. No admission is charged; the number to call for more information is (203) 801-2665.</p>
        <p>Tonight at 7, the First Church of Christ in Wethersfield offers a recital with a New Year's theme by the singer and songwriter Ken Medema, who is described as working with styles including jazz, folk, pop, Broadway and classical (860) 563-7759.</p>
        <p>Friends of Music of Fairfield County greet 1998 with a recital by the Cavani String Quartet at St. Paul Lutheran Church in Westport. The 4 o'clock program next Sunday lists quartets by Mozart, Bartok and Dvorak; at 3:15, Annie Fullard, Mari Sato, Kirsten Docter and Merry Peckham will lead a discussion about their background and repertory choices (203) 341-7100.</p>
        <p>In addition to presenting its popular concert series, Friends of Music has made an effort to expand its presentations to local schools. ''The kids' love for classical music is there,'' says Natalie Maynard, who runs the group's educational outreach program, ''it only needs to be nurtured.''</p>
        <p>''The last time the Cavani Quartet was with us,'' she said, ''I took the players to several Fairfield elementary schools, and they were a sensation, with the children crowding around as if they were rock stars.''</p>
        <p>This time, a grant from Pitney Bowes enables the Cavani Quartet to spend the Monday after their recital (Jan. 12) in three Stamford schools -- Stark and Springdale Elementary and Dolan Middle School -- sharing their enthusiasm with the youngsters, and introducing them to the joys of music.</p>
        <p>Also for children: Bill Shontz takes his ''Green Up Family Show'' to the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University where the singer, songwriter and master of all manner of wind instruments will offer music with an environmentalist theme at 1 and again at 3 next Sunday afternoon (203) 254-4010.</p>
        <p>A final note: the Connecticut Federation of Music Clubs is sponsoring a competition for a piece to honor the 100th anniversary of the National Federation of Music Clubs. Cash prizes of $1,000 will be awarded, along with a performance of the winning work at the Pequot Library in April.</p>
        <p>The composer must be at least 21, and the work should be scored for one to four instruments or voices.</p>
        <p>The submission deadline is Jan. 15; the numbers to call for an application form are (203) 762-5286 or (203) 259-9894.</p>
