        <p>DAYLIGHT is still an hour away in Elton, La., and already the oaks are thick with humidity. The air, the trees, even the houses have a strange languor even though it is winter.

        <p>In the early light, I see women and men in the yard, horses in the shadows.

        <p>DAYLIGHT is still an hour away in Elton, La., and already the oaks are thick with humidity. The air, the trees, even the houses have a strange languor even though it is winter. Fog hovers in the dense brush, along gravel roads and wood-plank bridges and sloughs, and when I step from my car into the driveway of the Bertrand family farmstead, even my breath seems different -- more fluid than three hours ago when I crossed from Texas into Louisiana.</p>
        <p>In the early light, I see women and men in the yard, horses in the shadows. It is four days before Mardi Gras, and after the long drive east from Austin, I have surfaced in this small community in South Louisiana, lured by tales of the rough-riding high jinks known as ''Les courirs de Mardi Gras.'' Specific to Acadiana -- an area bounded by Lake Charles to the west, Lafayette to the east and Ville Platte to the north -- the courir is a daylong rite observed on horseback and flatbed trailer, on four-wheeler and on foot.</p>
        <p>It is open season for buffoonery -- a mandate for social anarchy when entire towns throw open their shutters and screen doors in a last ecstatic hurrah before Lent. During Mardi Gras, men become women and women men. Children grow up, adults regress. Strangers become friends. Nowhere is this more distilled, perhaps, than in Acadiana. The tradition goes back for generations, but only recently has the courir made a comeback. When I first heard of it last year, I was compelled by the spectacle of masked men roaming the countryside, trailed by beer trucks, bandwagons and lines of spectators, ''raiding'' farms of livestock and singing for their supper; krewes parading into town with their booty, repairing to the church fellowship hall or veterans' post to make communal gumbo; and the intergenerational fais do-dos that follow, where revelers named Fontenot, Thibidaux, Bertrand and Michaud two-step late into the night. It sounded much saner than the Big Easy on Fat Tuesday. Little did I know.</p>
        <p>In preparation, I contacted the Lafayette Convention and Visitors Commission, and received reams of information on hotels and restaurants, itineraries and telephone numbers for the courirs. I wanted to hit as many as possible, beginning in Elton, a town I've heard is particularly proud of its run's authenticity. A telephone call later, I have directions. As a semi-rare but welcome tourist, I am also invited to stay overnight. I pack up my bedroll and hit the road, planning a trajectory of west to east over the next five days.</p>
        <p>First stop: the tiny picket-fence town of Elton (population 1,400). When I pull into the Bertrands' old homestead several miles out, where the run begins each year, I am greeted by Cajun dialects, modified versions of archaic French, and the sound of fiddle. As a foreigner, I am given special attention and, to my surprise, a plate of barbecued raccoon and venison sausage. Cardinals and mockingbirds surf the fat foliage. Moss boas recline in the cypresses like revelers draped on Bourbon Street balconies. But Bourbon Street, a four-hour drive away, is far from where I stand. Except for the satellite dishes, souped-up Jimmies, and a storefront touting ''Lottery Tickets*Boudin*Videos,'' the region is Faulknerian, self-contained and defiant of time.</p>
        <p>SET in the swamp-and-prairie landscape of Southwest Louisiana, Acadiana is a place where families work the land of their ancestors, speak a language all their own and dance the Cajun waltz to the cry of  ''Et toi.'' They hunt deer and squirrel and keep the customs -- none so revealing as the course, a 250-year-old tradition that has resurfaced in the past decade in towns like Iota, Basile, Tee Mamou, Vermilionville and Elton.</p>
        <p>The few scholars who have investigated say it combines elements of ancient rites of spring and the medieval fete de la quemande -- a period of ceremonial begging and parody in which French peasants ransacked the countryside, playing pranks on the gentry. Over the years, in a way peculiar to this region, it has developed into a surreal cross-breed of Roman revelry, religious piety and New World rawness. Ask an Acadian, and he'll shrug good-naturedly, and say, ''C'est ca, chere. It's the Cajun way.''</p>
        <p>''We're just what we are,'' says Curt Guillory, an Elton resident. ''We all grew up together. We eat together. We go to church together.'' Guillory is the capitaine of Elton's krewe, and as leader, he is exempt from the rule of anonymity. Along with two others, he wears a cowboy hat and carries a white flag. It is the capitaines' job to keep the unruly lot in line, and they do so with a sharp wit and a whip -- unfurled throughout the day for a prank taken too far, a rider gone AWOL.</p>
        <p>Guillory and company are part of the group who have gathered in the predawn clear, not far from I-10 and Lake Charles. Masked and mounted on horses, the men wear conical hats cutting bizarre silhouettes against the lightening sky. A beer top pops. A rooster crows. All around, the men ready themselves for the run. They sport homemade costumes -- fringed pajamas and purple capes, union suits with tiger tails; masks made from chicken wire, fly-swatters, hockey gear.</p>
        <p>As a spectator, I am lucky enough to nab a spot in the bandwagon, where two fiddlers, an accordionist and a 'tit fer (little iron) player hold sway, and I am a comfortable distance behind the bedlam. Another rider explains that the whip harks back to the Roman Lupercalia, when in springtime men ritually ''beat'' the women to invoke fertility. Finally the musicians strike up, and as day breaks, strains of the official MardiGras song resound through the woods.</p>
        <p>''Les Mardi Gras e ou viens-tu? Tout a l'entour du fond d'hiver (Mardi Gras, where do you come from? Always around the bottom of winter).'' A capitaine waves his white flag, initiating the course, and the pack tear from the driveway, whooping and hollering in a pell-mell rush down the lane to the nearest stop -- the tidy, expectant Coushatta Indian reservation. A procession of cars falls in behind.</p>
        <p>Outside a neat brick house on the reservation, a middle-aged man in starched jeans stands in his driveway, smiling toward the rowdy troupe. He gives a nod, and the musicians reprise their song. Inebriated masqueraders slide from their horses and fall prone on the pavement of Lowell John's driveway. Some grovel, beg for change in high, penitent voices, while others tease children and cajole the elderly into dancing. One Mardi Gras'er huddles around John's feet and in the process of panhandling knots his shoelaces together. John shakes his head, smiles, hands over his contribution -- a box of sirloins. Though it requires no chase, the trophy is symbolic, and the men spring up, skipping like Deion Sanders in  the end zone. Their hallmark cry of ''whooooOOOOOP, whooooOOOOOP'' rings out as the entourage moves on. John looks down and sees that his shoelaces are gone.</p>
        <p>As the morning unfolds, so does the debauchery. The procession hits a couple dozen houses and farms as it segues into afternoon. At each stop, carloads bail out. Neighbors come into their yards to watch as Mardi Gras'ers ride each other's backs, scale telephone poles, ''steal'' babies and botch the wiring of idle farm equipment. In the scuffle for live chickens and guinea hens released by congenial homeowners, they flatten shrubbery and beg forgiveness.</p>
        <p>After Elton, I head east on Interstate 10, planning to park myself at one of the three Holiday Inns in Lafayette. I decide instead to wander to Mamou, where Mardi Gras festivities have overtaken the tiny epicenter of Cajun folk life. It is here that French-speaking families come on Saturday mornings to Fred's Lounge, home of the live Cajun music radio broadcast (on 1050, AM) . And it is here, in front of the tiny plank-floor dance hall, that Revon Reed and Paul Tate reintroduced the course in 1950.</p>
        <p>The town's run -- a melee of four-wheelers, trucks, runners and bold tag-alongs, some 200 strong -- won't begin until Fat Tuesday, two days later. But in homage to the season, a happy, besotted crowd spills into the street outside the homely storefront bars. There is no driving on Main Street during Mardi Gras. A bandstand marks one end, and people dancing chock-a-block to the stuff of ''Laissez les bon temps rouler'' bar the other. Old people, young people, cousins and friends form chains on their way to the stage. An octogenarian asks for a dance. Some college kids who have tapped a keg on the sidewalk offer me a beer.</p>
        <p>My final stop, after sojourns into Lafayette for fried frog legs at the legendary Mulate's and a good night's rest at the  Holiday Inn, is Tee Mamou (for Little Mamou), where I've been offered accommodations in the sleeper cab of an idle 18-wheeler on a local family's land. Here, 35 miles outside (Grande) Mamou, Mardi Gras rowdiness takes a bizarre twist, as the krewes gather at night for a pre-course showdown at D. I.'s restaurant on Highway 97. Like other riders in other towns, they wear pointed capichons, homemade masks and costumes; but unlike others, they've adopted a strange sort of wrestling match that pits the Mardi Gras'ers against the capitaines.</p>
        <p>While D. I.'s customers (some out of towners) munch on fried catfish and dirty rice, the masqueraders invade the place, bound for the hardwood dance floor. Two by two, the masked men barrel into the arena, where Capitaine Gerald Fruge and his co-defender huddle with their whips. The challengers' aim: to tackle the leaders, or at least to pass through the gauntlet unscathed. Neither is an option, however; for no matter how hard they roll and wrestle, none can secure the whip or avoid a few whacks. Once on the other side, Fruge  helps them to their feet. Bruised but jubilant, the warriors cry, ''whooooOOOOOP, whooooOOOOOP'' as they exit the spotlight. Some crawl to nearby tables and hold out their hands for a dollar, a chicken wing, a handshake, then they retreat to the parking lot to drink beer and compare battle wounds. Tomorrow morning, the bleary-eyed krewe will ride. Tomorrow night, they will repeat the whole process. And come Ash Wednesday, the day of reckoning, they will have reaped their fill of anarchy, passing once more through the turbulence of Mardi Gras.</p>
        <p>A guide to anarchy: where to rest your head and savor Cajun food</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Continental has the only direct flights into Lafayette, although American Eagle, Northwest Airlines, and Atlantic Southeast (Delta) offer services from surrounding cities such as Baton Rouge and Houston. Surprisingly, there are no flights from New Orleans to Lafayette; the drive to Lafayette from New Orleans is about four hours.</p>
        <p>The 1998 Mardi Gras is Feb. 21 to 24. Reasonably priced hotels can be found in Lafayette, Lake Charles, Jennings, Kinder and other towns near Interstate 10. Information is available through the Lafayette Convention and Visitors Commission.</p>
        <p>The office publishes detailed lists of events throughout Cajun country, and it also has lists of hotels and restaurants and points of interest. The center can be reached at (800) 346-1958 or (318) 232-3737, fax (318) 232-0161.</p>
        <p>The main runs are in Eunice, Iota, Elton (these are more family oriented, the first two have children's runs), Mamou, Church Point and Tee Mamou (whose all-male rides can be quite rowdy), as well as Vermilionville, Ville Platte and the all-female run in Tee Mamou. Also, Lafayette plays host to the annual Festival de Mardi Gras on the weekend before Fat Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Accommodations</p>
        <p>Most of the time I winged it, taking accommodation in a family's spare room or the unoccupied sleeper cab of a semi (graciously offered by a family in Tee Mamou). Otherwise, I stayed at the Holiday Inn North in Lafayette, 2716 Northeast Evangeline Thruway, (318) 233-0003. It was fine for $67, single, and provided the only three things I needed: a hot bath, early-morning wake-up call and the coffeepot in the room. Among the dozens of hotels in Lafayette are a</p>
        <p>Hilton, a Marriott Courtyard and a Fairfield Inn by Marriott; also Best Western, Days Inn, La Quinta and so forth. There are a number of bed-and-breakfasts in the area, as well.</p>
        <p>Eating</p>
        <p>From the roadside boudin stalls to the fresh produce stands, fresh, succulent fare abounds. Many truck stops and mom-and-pop cafes offer boudin and gumbo. The restaurants below accept major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Mulate's Cajun Restaurant, a few miles outside Lafayette on Highway 94, (318) 332-4648, is an old-style Cajun dance hall and restaurant whose specialties include frog-leg, oyster, crab, shrimp and crawfish dishes, etouffees and ''barbues frittes'' (fried catfish). Not to be missed is the ''barbue Mulate,'' fried catfish topped with crawfish etouffee. Open daily 11 A.M.to 10 P.M.</p>
        <p>Prejean's Restaurant, 3480 Interstate 49 North, (318) 896-3247, is a regional favorite, specializing in rack of elk, Cajun roasted duck, eggplant Pirogue Louis (fried eggplant filled with shrimp, crawfish and crab, topped with sauce Louis) and other nouvelle Cajun fare. Open Sunday to Thursday, 11 A.M. to 10 P.M., Friday and Saturday to 11.</p>
        <p>Enola Prudhomme's Cajun Cafe (run by Paul's sister), 4676 Northeast Evangeline Thruway, (318) 896-3646, is in an old Victorian maison. The menu includes sauteed, fried and blackened Cajun dishes, homemade jalapeno bread and fried alligator. Open Monday to Saturday 11 A.M. to 10 P.M.</p>
        <p>Matilda's in Eunice, at 611 South St. Mary Road, (318) 546-0329, is legendary for its stuffed paunce, or stomach of pig filled with ground meat. Open Tuesday to Thursday 11 A.M. to 7 P.M., Friday to 10 P.M., Sunday to 3 P.M., Saturday 11:30 A.M. to 8 P.M.</p>
        <p>For all-hours dining, try the Grande Casino Coushatta north of Kinder on Highway 165; (318) 738-7263. It has three restaurants and a sandwich shop. The casino's Big Sky Steakhouse has a rib-eye with sauce piquante.</p>
        <p>DonnE's Cooking in Jennings, 704A-1 Highway 26 North, (318) 824-3402, Specializes in seasoned whole fried catfish, etouffees and gumbos, stuffed pork chops and bread pudding with rum sauce.</p>
