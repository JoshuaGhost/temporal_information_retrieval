        <p>Green Bay, San Francisco, Denver and Pittsburgh did not arrive in today's National Football League conference championship games without violent defense. And none will reach Super Bowl XXXII without it.</p>
        <p>Defense is violence. It is aggressiveness and attacking. It sets the tone. It gauges respect. It creates havoc. It is the surest display of will and stamina.</p>
        <p>Offense is theater.</p>
        <p>Defense, bottom line, is the show.</p>
        <p>And to reach the Big Show -- Super Bowl XXXII on Jan. 25 in San Diego -- the stingiest, rock-hard-hitting defense in each conference championship game today will surface. Green Bay at San Francisco, the National Football Conference matchup, and Denver at Pittsburgh, the American Football Conference battle, feature the best teams in each conference. The best defenses.</p>
        <p>Each team has its defensive schemes, its tactics, its philosophies. Each has Pro Bowl defenders. Each has ball-hawking, playmaking people. Each has a will.</p>
        <p>Today is all about finding a way. Via defense. Here is a look at how it might be done.</p>
        <p>GREEN BAY PACKERS Let's get physical. The Green Bay defense is a throwback, a punishing bunch that is as big as it is brutish and as swift as it is quick.</p>
        <p>There are no weaknesses here.</p>
        <p>The front four, anchored by the left end Reggie White and the left tackle Gilbert Brown, is mammoth and strong. The linebackers, led by a rejuvenated veteran, Seth Joyner, are big and mobile. The secondary -- cornerbacks Doug Evans and Tyrone Williams and safeties LeRoy Butler and Eugene Robinson -- may be the best in football. And this is without maybe the best Packer defender, cornerback Craig Newsome, who was injured in the season opener and lost for the year.</p>
        <p>Evans stepped in for Newsome, taking on the opponent's best receiver each week. Evans has been superb, the key to the Packers' defense all season. He is 6 feet 1 inch, 190 pounds, and is long and rangy. He is able to make up ground in a short time, and even when beaten, has the ability to swipe at the ball and break up big passes. And he has a nose for the ball. When a crucial play occurs, Evans is usually in the mix.</p>
        <p>''It took me a while to adjust to the new role of being the guy to shut down the other team's top receiver, but I love it now,'' Evans said. ''It's always a challenge. You want to be the best, you face the best.''</p>
        <p>Look for Santana Dotson, the right tackle, to also figure prominently in today's matchup. Dotson (6-5, 285) will face single blocking most of the day from the 49ers, and if he can work that to his advantage and slip free often enough, he can help turn the game the Packers' way.</p>
        <p>The 3Com Park grass field will likely be wet and muddy, and rain might fall  throughout the game. That would help the Green Bay defense, which is suited for grass. Less-than-ideal conditions might also slow the 49ers' offense, which is built on speed, quickness and timing.</p>
        <p>Expect the Packers to deliver every kind of hit on 49ers quarterback Steve Young. The Packers enter every game intent on hammering the offensive players, in general, and the quarterback, in particular. Green Bay's playoff victories over San Francisco in the last two seasons were marked by its defense pulverizing the 49ers' ball-handlers, especially their receivers. Expect the same formula today.</p>
        <p>SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS Speed, smarts, leadership. Everywhere one looks at the 49ers' defensive roster, there are proven, veteran stars. The front four of tackles Dana Stubblefield and Bryant Young and ends Roy Barker and Chris Doleman has a combined 28 years of pro experience. The linebackers -- Lee Woodall and Ken Norton Jr. outside and Gary Plummer inside -- offer 26 years. The secondary includes cornerbacks Marquez Pope and Rod Woodson and safeties Tim McDonald and Merton Hanks; they have 34 years of pro experience.</p>
        <p>That type of tested lineup gives the 49ers an edge at adjusting. There are not too many defensive schemes or offensive looks that this bunch has not encountered at some point in their careers.</p>
        <p>Stubblefield's 15 sacks earned him N.F.L. defensive player of the year honors. His role, along with Young inside, is immeasurable. Both plug the middle and force teams to run outside. Doleman has the speed to catch ball-carriers there and the safeties are not shy about forcing the edge and supporting the run.</p>
        <p>Stubblefield is the man in the middle for the 49ers, but another key defensive player today might be Pope.</p>
        <p>This is his fifth pro season but only his third at cornerback. Add in the fact that he is playing in only his fifth game this season because of a foot injury, and it is easy to see why Green Bay figures to win the matchup of receivers Robert Brooks or Antonio Freeman vs. Pope. Pope, however, has different plans.</p>
        <p>''I'm scared for the people on the field for this game,'' Pope said. ''There is going to be real violence. I think both teams look at it like it's the real Super Bowl, whether that is right or wrong. This is about challenge and respect. I've got to go out there and show people why they shouldn't be throwing my way. We are a hard-nosed defensive football team and we seek to set the standard for four quarters. No one knows the heart of a player until he steps on that field. My heart is definitely in this game.''</p>
        <p>DENVER BRONCOS This is the Broncos' defensive formula: Use our high-powered offense to get a lead, bring eight players in the box, snuff the opponent's run and force the other team to throw it -- if it can.</p>
        <p>The Denver defense tricks its opponents. It makes them keep up with the Broncos' offensive firepower by making them think they must abandon the running game. Then the Denver defense has them.</p>
        <p>It has multiple fronts and multiple looks and attacks relentlessly.</p>
        <p>''We used to be a defense that played a lot of soft zone and sat back waiting for the action,'' Denver free safety Steve Atwater said. ''Now this is the third year where we've changed that; we've got big bruisers up front, we are disciplined and we go very hard on every play.''</p>
        <p>Greg Robinson, the Denver defensive coordinator, said that facing Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart presents unique problems.</p>
        <p>''Stewart has the legs but he has the arm, too,'' Robinson said. ''They do a lot of things with his wheels, but he will beat you with his arm if you focus solely on his running. We are not one thing on defense. We mix it up a lot and we mix our people. Our defense is predicated on keeping an offense off-balance. We don't want the quarterback getting comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Atwater was the key player on the Denver defense all season, but in this game John Mobley, the right linebacker, is the focus. He will be the key in stopping back Jerome Bettis from helping the Steelers run away with the A.F.C. title. He must also contribute in keeping Stewart in check when Stewart decides to scramble.</p>
        <p>PITTSBURGH STEEELERS Linebackers lead. And no team asks of its linebackers what the Steelers do. Their linebackers must rush the passer, defend the run and drop back in pass coverage. Routinely. Their linebackers are the best athletes on the Pittsburgh roster and that is not by accident. They have to be.</p>
        <p>Jason Gildon is a budding star. The veteran Levon Kirkland is already a star.</p>
        <p>''You can't just say any one of our linebackers is the best because we feed off each other,'' Kirkland said. ''Our linebackers have to have speed, be athletic and hit and hit hard. We have good relationships all around on and off the field. The egos here are kept in check. I see that as one of the reasons we have had success.''</p>
        <p>The Steelers have lost such linebacking stars as Chad Brown and Kevin Greene and now are without their onetime catalyst Greg Lloyd, but they still excel at the position. With this franchise, carbon copies at linebacker just seem to materialize.</p>
        <p>The Pittsburgh defense loves to blitz. It comes at opponents from a variety of angles, from wide and near, low and high. Cornerbacks blitz. Safeties blitz. Everybody blitzes. And this defense is very physical.</p>
        <p>Kirkland was the Pittsburgh defensive key during the season and he will be at it against Denver. He has to tackle Denver running back Terrell Davis. If Davis breaks free often enough, the rest of the Denver offense clicks. Without Davis running, the Steelers can blitz the Broncos freely and change the flow of the game.</p>
        <p>For Green Bay, San Francisco, Denver and Pittsburgh, in their quest for Super Bowl XXXII, speed may kill. Special teams may dazzle. Offense may glow.</p>
        <p>But defense must rule.</p>
