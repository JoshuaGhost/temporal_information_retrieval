        <p>IN 1970, William H.

        <p>IN 1970, William H. Whyte, who had written the blueprint for preservation of Connecticut's natural resources in 1962, noted that the state's privately owned land -- the bulk of Connecticut's open space -- still remained highly vulnerable to encroachment. Almost three decades later, the land planner's assessment remains true.</p>
        <p>Last June, the legislature passed a law setting a state goal of holding at least 10 percent of Connecticut's land area as open space and requiring the commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection to develop a strategy for achieving it.</p>
        <p>Connecticut has 3.2 million acres. Of this, 210,000 acres or 6.6 percent is owned by the state. To achieve the 10 percent, another 110,000 acres is needed. This would be divided among productive forest land, scenic and historically significant properties, greenway linkages, access to water and natural areas.</p>
        <p>A task force on open space, appointed last August by Gov. John G. Rowland, has been conducting public hearings on developing a comprehensive statewide plan to attain the 10 percent goal. The plan, expected to be completed soon, will specify techniques and a timetable for acquisition. The D.E.P.'s assistant commissioner and task force chairman, David Leff, said he hoped the plan would ''focus on land that the state should be acquiring and some financial resources.''</p>
        <p>Nationwide, Connecticut ranks second  lowest in terms of public holdings of open space. (Rhode Island is the lowest.) Neighboring Massachusetts and New York each have more than 10 percent of their land in state ownership.</p>
        <p>Some Connecticut municipalities and citizen groups have taken initiatives within their own towns to stem development, create land acquisition committees and funds, amend zoning, revise town plans, and take stock of privately owned open space vulnerable for development.</p>
        <p>No one has been as vocal or high profile as the Easton Coalition to Preserve Trout Brook Valley, which is fighting a plan to develop 740 acres of Bridgeport Hydraulic Company land in Easton and Weston. National Fairways Inc., of Greenwich, headed by Marc C. Bergschneider, an Easton resident for a dozen years, has a contract to buy the $14 million parcel for a championship 18-hole golf course and 103 houses on three-acre lots. The houses would average $1 million each, with golf memberships around $80,000 plus annual fees. The development plan includes 50 acres of public access, 78 acres of conservation easements and 113 acres of undisturbed wetlands.</p>
        <p>The parcel, on the westerly side of Route 58 north of Freeborn Road, is the core of a 10-square-mile tract of open space bordered by Aspetuck Land Trust property, the Connecticut Golf Club, a 175-member private club founded in 1962, and other privately held open space and water company property.</p>
        <p>During the state's task force public hearing in Easton recently, Gail Brommer, a member of Easton's Conservation Commission and chairwoman of its Open Space Task Force, said it was very difficult for a town like Easton, with only 2,200 families, to raise the money to buy large tracts of land when they came on the market. She urged the state's task force to consider open space acquisition in Fairfield County ''where there's a large share of people.''</p>
        <p>Easton has a steadfast tradition of maintaining its rural character. While two-thirds of its land mass is owned by the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company, the water company is restricted by the Department of Public Utility Control to selling only its Class 3 lands, most of which is the Trout Brook tract.</p>
        <p>''Basically, this is it,'' said the coalition's head, Patricia Falkenhagen, emphasizing the importance of keeping the Trout Brook Valley as open space. ''It is the largest single tract of land available, not only in Easton but also in Fairfield County.''</p>
        <p>''We felt this one was right for the community,'' said Richard Schmidt,  chief executive officer of Bridgeport Hydraulic Company's parent company, Aquarion. ''The land has been targeted for sale since the 70's. You have to remember, we are a private company with customers and shareholders. In a perfect world, we would say, 'Let's keep this open space.' We have tried to do it in the best manner. These are difficult calls.''</p>
        <p>The coalition is working with the Aspetuck Land Trust and its executive director, Bruce LePage, to see if they can put together a package of state and local monies and private donations to buy Trout Brook for open space. Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward have supported the open space proposals in their hometown, Westport. At a recent public hearing before Easton's Planning and Zoning Commission, the actor pledged $500,000 to a land trust to purchase the parcel. Mr. Newman said that if the land went to a developer it would be shortchanging future generations.</p>
        <p>As with many Connecticut towns, Westport sees opportunity for open space acquisition dwindling. The town, now finalizing its Plan of Conservation and Development, still wants to acquire the 20-acre Baron's South property, on a corner along Route 1 in the heart of town.</p>
        <p>''We are over 90 percent development,'' said Katherine Barnard,  Westport's Planning and Zoning director. ''We are watching the town's  natural beauty disappear.''</p>
        <p>These sentiments are shared by Westport's neighboring towns. Last fall, Fairfield established a seven-member Land Acquisition Commission, following an outcry over the development of a former estate near an elementary school, which had been eyed for open space and athletic fields. The town, restricted by its charter to only bid market value, could not match the developer's offer.</p>
        <p>The new Land Acquisition Commission will develop a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of 70 acres of open space for each 1,000 town residents.</p>
        <p>Fairfield also amended its zoning regulations requiring subdivision applications of four acres, or five or more lots, to set aside 10 percent of the total area of the subdivision to the town for open space or 10 percent of the value of the land in lieu of land donation.</p>
        <p>Although preservationists are pleased with the set-aside rulings, at least one long-term landowner is not. William Miro, a farmer in Fairfield, said that the ruling was discriminatory against people like himself, who have held on to their land for generations, in his case, three. ''My land is a part of my family's financial future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stratford, too, requires an applicant of five or more subdivision lots to set aside 10 percent of the land for open space. And, like Fairfield and Westport, Stratford has a proposal for a Plan of Conservation and Development that includes an open space component recommending protection of at least an additional 100 acres.</p>
        <p>There are different types of open space, said the Stratford town planner, David Killeen. ''There's the classic form of open fields and then there's the need for breaks in the asphalt,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Killeen also said that there always ''must be concern for balance between the rights of the property owner and the public interests.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer in Stratford, Barry Knott, feels the open space issue in his town is practically moot because Stratford is 99 percent developed. ''The horse is already out of the barn,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knott also said he was not in favor of government's expanding role in people's lives. ''You have to balance these restrictions with the role of government,'' he maintained.</p>
        <p>These sentiments were shared by a group of Norwalk residents who gathered enough signatures for a referendum seeking to reverse the city's attempt to acquire Fodor Farm by eminent domain. The city is seeking to buy 9.2 acres off Flax Hill Road, with a $2.7 million open space state grant and city money.</p>
        <p>The group, the Committee for Reasonable Spending of Tax Money, protested the city's involvement in Fodor Farm's future, whether or not it should be developed or remain open space.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's against open space,'' said Richard Moccia, the city's Republican town chairman, who led the fight for the referendum (which failed to attract to the polls the required minimum of 25 percent of qualified voters). Mr. Moccia insists that ''the city shouldn't stick its noise in it; it's just the wrong use of taxpayers' money.''</p>
        <p>In Milford, the Environmental Concerns Coalition -- which includes representatives from the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center, town boards and commissions and Mayor Fred Lisman -- has set a preliminary goal to acquire 1,000 acres of open space over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The coalition's chairwoman, Betsy Wright, said, ''We look at other communities and we hear them say, 'Preserve our farmlands.' In Milford, we have no vision. It's our last gasp effort.''</p>
