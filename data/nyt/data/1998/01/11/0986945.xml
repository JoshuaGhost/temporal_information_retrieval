        <p>ON A CROWDED CHRISTMAS  shopping day, Barbara Fincher and her sister politely vied for space with another determined shopper at the ''X-Files'' shelf of an independent bookstore in suburban Louisville, Ky.

        <p>''We like the show because so much of it is about Government experimentation on people,'' she explained, noting a parallel with her volunteer work at a pregnancy center and her support of Human Life International, a ''birth spacing'' organization. ''H.L.I. investigates what's going on throughout the world, and how our Government, especially, is involved in population control. Like Scully was kidnapped, but it wasn't by aliens. It was by the Government, who managed to extract all her eggs in order to create some sort of beings.''</p>

        <p>ON A CROWDED CHRISTMAS  shopping day, Barbara Fincher and her sister politely vied for space with another determined shopper at the ''X-Files'' shelf of an independent bookstore in suburban Louisville, Ky. Ms. Fincher, 55, has been a self-described ''X-phile'' for the last year and a half.</p>
        <p>''We like the show because so much of it is about Government experimentation on people,'' she explained, noting a parallel with her volunteer work at a pregnancy center and her support of Human Life International, a ''birth spacing'' organization. ''H.L.I. investigates what's going on throughout the world, and how our Government, especially, is involved in population control. Like Scully was kidnapped, but it wasn't by aliens. It was by the Government, who managed to extract all her eggs in order to create some sort of beings.''</p>
        <p>Part-sci-fi, part-mystery, part-police-drama, ''The X-Files,'' Fox's highest-rated show for 18-to-49-year-olds, is in its fifth season. And unlike other series that find audiences vaporizing after the initial flash of success, ''The X-Files'' keeps building its fan base with latecomers like Ms. Fincher. In its first season (1993-94), the series had a 5.4 rating, which means about 5 million households were watching. By 1996, there were about 10 million. And this season the series has about 13.7 million households, more than 3 million of them new to the show.</p>
        <p>One reason fans get so hooked is the same reason some feel the need to communicate with one another: the series' rather nonlinear plot line.</p>
        <p>''Very rarely is everything spelled out,'' observes Mitch Pileggi, who plays Walter Skinner, the F.B.I. assistant director. ''I think it's one of the great things about the show, that a lot of times people are forced to use their own imagination to come up with what's transpired. I'm just as confused as everybody else about a lot of this stuff.''</p>
        <p>Anyone coming late to the series, which has spawned more than 100 episodes, nearly all of which are available on videotape or seen in reruns, is well advised to consider some basic facts. For starters, ''The X-Files,'' which shadows two F.B.I. agents investigating Government conspiracies to hide the truth about extraterrestrials and other phenomena, deals with three themes:  mutants and monsters, paranormal activity, and aliens and U.F.O.'s.</p>
        <p>The agents' struggles with monsters and the paranormal are neatly reconciled in self-contained shows that the producers call ''stand-alones.'' Only 20 percent of the episodes concern the mythology, which revolves around Agent Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny's) fascination with U.F.O.'s and the regression-hypnosis that led him to believe that his younger sister, Samantha, was abducted by aliens at age 8. The event sparked a personal quest to find her and informs his unconventional, unpopular work at the bureau (he's relegated to a cluttered office in the headquarters' basement, where he pores over unexplainable and seemingly unsolvable cases, named the ''X'' files).</p>
        <p>''With the mythology shows,'' says Frank Spotnitz, this season's co-executive producer, who has been a co-writer of those episodes since the show's second season, ''it's helpful to know something about what's happened before. But even in those shows, we try to repeat what we really need to know to understand what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Well, yes and no. Chris Carter, the series creator, admits that though some of the stories are made more interesting by looking backward, he and his team remove ''all the certainties, things that characters held to be true,'' when reviewing the foundations of story lines and characters' motivations.</p>
        <p>''Part of the fun,'' he says, ''is that as many times as we answer questions, we impose new ones.''</p>
        <p>In other words, many of the motifs and plot threads may be interwoven, but just when you think resolution is at hand, you're likely to feel even more, well, alien than ever. Especially about the back story.</p>
        <p>''I think what confuses people most'' about the conspiracy plot, Mr. Pileggi says, ''is that the number of characters has grown, and each of the characters' personalities and situations has become more complex.''</p>
        <p>''THERE ARE ALSO SO  many organizations within the Government that are keeping tabs on each other through counterintelligence,'' he adds, ''that it's hard to know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.''</p>
        <p>But if the real identities and agendas of characters boggle the mind -- consider the Cigarette Smoking Man (a seemingly sinister force who works to cover up the discoveries of Mulder and his partner, Dana Scully) or the Elders (a mysterious organization with direct knowledge of Samantha's abduction) -- Mr. Spotnitz tells fans to relax.</p>
        <p>There are only a couple of events, he says, that viewers need to know to follow the story: the early abduction of Mulder's sister and the abduction of Scully (Gillian Anderson) during the second season, both of which reverberate throughout the mythology episodes.</p>
        <p>But viewers who may have missed one or both of those events -- or who have taken note of the recurring images of smallpox vaccinations, bees and railroad cars without the slightest idea what they mean -- probably have more elementary questions.  For example:</p>
        <p>* What really happened to Mulder's sister? At first, Samantha seemed to have been taken in a classic alien-abduction scenario: through a window by an outside force. But now the writers have suggested that she was snatched by someone associated with the Cigarette Smoking Man or by the people whom Mulder's father associated with in his younger days as part of ''the project,'' a scientific experiment that has ''resonance with Nazi Germany,'' as Mr. Carter puts it. Whether her abductors removed Samantha from the household to protect her or to clone her remains unclear. She does appear to have been cloned, however, both as a child and as an adult.</p>
        <p>* Does the Cigarette Smoking Man, whose life or death following a shooting is now uncertain, have something to do with Mulder's mother? Maybe, if you count an affair. ''We are now led to believe with some authority,'' says Mr. Carter, in a tone that suggests he merely investigated it, instead of having created it, ''that he may be the father of Mulder's sister. And there is some question whether he is also Mulder's father.''</p>
        <p>* Did Scully really become Mulder's partner as a spy, someone who was supposed to report his bizarre behavior to the bureau? Scully, who is a physician in addition to an F.B.I. agent, was assigned to debunk Mulder's work. But, says Mr. Carter, ''she set out to do that with integrity, and while she may have been sent out to be a spy, she never allowed herself to be co-opted.''</p>
        <p>* Finally, what's the situation now, especially as Agent Mulder and Agent Scully have evolved from investigating phenomena to becoming part of the story? At the end of a recent two-part episode, Agent Scully hears the voice of her dead sister, Melissa, and soon learns that as a result of experimentation on her during her abduction she, Scully, is the mother of Emily, a little girl with a strange physiology and body chemistry. In bringing Scully's Roman Catholicism to the forefront in these episodes (prayers with her priest, crucifix symbolism, references to an immaculate conception), the series has temporarily shifted its ever-present spiritual undertones to religious overtones.</p>
        <p>FOR THOSE STILL confused, Mr. Carter promises that many of the series' puzzling questions will be answered in June in the ''X-Files'' feature film, ''Fight the Future,'' and in a two-part cliffhanger season finale that leads into it.</p>
        <p>But new viewers shouldn't be daunted by all the complexity, says Andy Meisler, author of the forthcoming ''I Want to Believe: The Official Guide to 'The X-Files,' Volume 3'' (named for the U.F.O. poster that hangs behind Mulder's desk). ''It's  O.K. to enjoy the show on a less intensive level,'' says Mr. Meisler, who also writes frequently about television for The New York Times.  ''The characters of Mulder and Scully are pretty straightforward after a couple of episodes, and besides, you have to remember that everything is  ambiguous.''</p>
        <p>Which means that just because we saw the evil double agent Krycek in the bathroom as Mulder's father was murdered doesn't mean that Krycek was the killer. And in keeping with Mr. Carter's ''anything can happen'' and ''nobody ever really dies on this show'' rules (characters can either be resurrected in episodes that took place in the past or simply show up in the future), the dead African-American character known only as X, who may or may not have been Agent Mulder's friend, may not be so dead after all. As Mr. Spotnitz puts it, on ''The X-Files''' at least, ''the truth is always elusive.''</p>
        <p>Apparently so, but the producers' real drive may be making the show as frightening and entertaining as possible -- a goal often attained in  episodes like ''Home,'' about the very self-contained Peacock family, and ''The Host,'' in which the Flukeman, a large blood-sucking worm, wreaks havoc in the New Jersey sewers.</p>
        <p>''I think we all love the conspiracy and mythology here,'' says Mr. Spotnitz, ''and we are very proud of those shows. But the most fun for us are those monster shows. It's fun scaring people, and scaring ourselves.''</p>
