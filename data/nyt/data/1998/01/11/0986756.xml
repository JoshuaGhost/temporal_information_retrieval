        <p>Despite a generous international bailout last year, Indonesia is sinking deeper into financial chaos and political paralysis. This weekend, emissaries from the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund are traveling to Jakarta for urgent meetings on the crisis. They should insist that Indonesia fulfill its pledges to carry out tough economic reforms. Beyond that, they need to make clear that the markets there have collapsed as much from concern over President Suharto's corrupt brand of crony capitalism as from other underlying ailments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto has long been warned that a closed economic and political system must be opened up. Indonesia's continued prosperity provided an excuse for not doing so. Even last week, with the economy in crisis, Mr. Suharto announced a budget with wildly unrealistic projections and took several other steps that backed away from earlier promises of fiscal and monetary austerity. If he does not abandon his complacent approach, he risks a cutoff of the vital funding from overseas needed to keep Indonesia solvent.</p>

        <p>Despite a generous international bailout last year, Indonesia is sinking deeper into financial chaos and political paralysis. This weekend, emissaries from the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund are traveling to Jakarta for urgent meetings on the crisis. They should insist that Indonesia fulfill its pledges to carry out tough economic reforms. Beyond that, they need to make clear that the markets there have collapsed as much from concern over President Suharto's corrupt brand of crony capitalism as from other underlying ailments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto has long been warned that a closed economic and political system must be opened up. Indonesia's continued prosperity provided an excuse for not doing so. Even last week, with the economy in crisis, Mr. Suharto announced a budget with wildly unrealistic projections and took several other steps that backed away from earlier promises of fiscal and monetary austerity. If he does not abandon his complacent approach, he risks a cutoff of the vital funding from overseas needed to keep Indonesia solvent.</p>
        <p>Indonesia has important strengths, including its ability to export manufactured goods and oil. The current crisis arose as international lenders pumped money into its banking and corporate system, thinking that prosperity would last forever. Once the Indonesian currency started dropping, the loans could not easily be repaid. Last week, the currency all but collapsed, throwing hundreds of banks and companies into bankruptcy. Citizens have begun hoarding food. Fears of unemployment and social unrest are spreading. Some Indonesians even fear possible intervention by the army. For the first time, there is open talk that President Suharto, in power for 32 years, should retire.</p>
        <p>There is a danger in Indonesia of confusing the country's interests with Mr. Suharto's. Of course, unemployment, riots and political instability would not benefit anyone. The I.M.F. must be careful not to impose such strict measures that the country is thrown into a ruinous collapse.</p>
        <p>But there must be no accommodation for the Suharto family's financial interests, which Mr. Suharto has so far shielded. Import monopolies benefiting companies tied to the Suharto family have been retained. Although 16 insolvent banks were closed, one of the President's sons was allowed to reopen his own bank under a different name. Other needless projects, including an unnecessary power plant on Java, are going forward because of their connections to the Suharto family.</p>
        <p>The importance of taking vigorous steps to defend Indonesia's currency and to insure the repayment of loans goes far beyond Indonesia itself. A default by Indonesia could spread throughout the region and, from there, jolt the banking systems of Japan, Europe and the United States. As for Mr. Suharto, he increasingly seems more of an impediment to reform. Until recently, he had been expected to be easily reappointed in a few months to another term by his loyal National Assembly. Instead of clinging to power in a nation now mired in debt, Mr. Suharto may well need to decide that the best thing he can do for his country is to step aside. So far, he has shown no sign that he is prepared to put Indonesia's future ahead of his own.</p>
