        <p>A TUMBLE in long-term bond rates in the infant days of 1998 could be the beginning of good news for investors who have been moving holdings into bond funds, seeking a haven from the world's tumultuous equity markets.</p>
        <p>Long-term rates dropped to their lowest level in nearly 30 years last week after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cited the possibility of deflation, or widespread price declines, and gave market professionals reason to hope that the Fed would lower short-term interest rates.

        <p>A TUMBLE in long-term bond rates in the infant days of 1998 could be the beginning of good news for investors who have been moving holdings into bond funds, seeking a haven from the world's tumultuous equity markets.</p>
        <p>Long-term rates dropped to their lowest level in nearly 30 years last week after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cited the possibility of deflation, or widespread price declines, and gave market professionals reason to hope that the Fed would lower short-term interest rates. And bond rates could fall further, some analysts say, if the Asian financial crisis slows the American economy by more than the market now projects. All in all, many expect bond funds to outperform stock funds this year for the first time since 1993.</p>
        <p>Mutual fund investors also seem to be betting that way, having stepped up their investments in bond funds in the last three months of 1997. From the stock market skid in late October until mid-December, the rate at which cash flowed into bond funds doubled to $1.3 billion a week, as measured by a four-week moving-average, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows. The rate of money flowing into stock funds slowed from $3.6 billion a week in late October to $1.7 billion a week by mid-December. And for three weeks during the period, stock funds suffered redemptions totaling $2.4 billion.</p>
        <p>''There is clearly some reallocation to the bond market from the stock market,'' said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data.</p>
        <p>And that could continue, some portfolio managers say. James E. Conroy, lead manager of the Smith Barney Government Securities fund, for example, says the Asian crisis runs deeper than is generally believed. As a result, he sees the 30-year Treasury yield slipping from the current 5.73 percent -- the lowest since the Government began issuing the bond regularly, in 1977 -- to 5.5 percent by the end of the first quarter and to 5 percent by year-end.</p>
        <p>''We're in uncharted territory,'' he said, adding that he thought the Federal Reserve would lower rates by the end of the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conroy's fund posted one of the best performances among domestic intermediate bond funds last year, with a return of 11.2 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking firm in Chicago.</p>
        <p>This year, analysts project bond fund returns will be in the 7 percent to 11 percent range, while stocks could be poised for a breather after a long bull market.</p>
        <p>If bonds gain on stocks, it would fit a historical pattern: Whenever stocks have outperformed intermediate-term bonds by an annualized average return of nine or more percentage points over a five-year period, the difference between bond and stock returns has narrowed considerably over the next five-year period, according to Ibbotson Associates, the Chicago research firm.</p>
        <p>In the most recent period studied by Ibbotson, stocks beat bonds by nine percentage points for the five years ended in 1996; historically speaking, the two sectors' performance should be more in sync.</p>
        <p>But others are less sanguine about bonds. While they agree that bonds could be the better investment in 1998, they expect inflation threats to end the rally that began last year. That would force investors to be satisfied with returns of 6 percent to 8 percent for the year -- a far cry from the top returns of 1997.</p>
        <p>Rates of long-term securities fell more than a percentage point in the last half-year, helping the average long-term Treasury fund post a total return of 11.99 percent and the average intermediate Government fund to return 8.41 percent for the year, according to Morningstar. Over all, taxable bond funds, including Treasuries and corporate and international holdings, returned 8.85 percent last year. That is well below the 23.72 percent return of the average diversified domestic stock fund, but it is more than respectable for bonds.</p>
        <p>Can long-term rates get any lower? Yes, said William H. Gross, who oversees bond investing at the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco.</p>
        <p>He, too, predicts that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will dip as low as 5.5 percent, and that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy sooner rather than later, by half a percentage point. These predictions are based on his expectation that the United States economy will weaken substantially. ''That weak economy really comes from Asia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some managers of big bond funds, like Ian A. MacKinnon, who heads fixed-income investments at the Vanguard Group, are staking out a middle ground. Mr. MacKinnon, who led Vanguard Fixed-Income Long-Term Treasury to a 13.9 percent return in 1997, predicts that the crisis in Asia will slow the economy, but says the effect might be mitigated by higher inflation in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacKinnon does not see much capital appreciation from bonds in 1998. Still, he added, ''bonds are a better buy than stocks right now,'' because stock prices are likely to be hurt as companies grapple with an influx of cheap Asian imports, while their own labor costs rise at home.</p>
        <p>William J. Curtin, chief investment officer for fixed income at Putnam Investments, is one of the most bearish managers of big bond funds. He expects Asia's financial difficulties to stabilize, allowing growth in the United States to remain strong. That could lead the Fed to push up interest rates to avert inflation, he said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Fred Robertson, chief investment officer of fixed income at Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management, expects economic growth to pick up after six months, with yields on long-term bonds moving up to 6.5 percent to 7 percent.</p>
