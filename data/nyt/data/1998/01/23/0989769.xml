        <p>In his first public comment on a Federal inquiry into his campaign finances, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he was ''absolutely confident'' that no wrongdoing had occurred, suggesting that he was so unconcerned that he had not even spoken about it to campaign officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki acknowledged that he knew the Korean-immigrant businessman, a volunteer for the 1994 campaign, who is a target of the investigation. The United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn is examining whether the businessman, Yung Soo Yoo, and others tied to the campaign solicited contributions from at least two Korean immigrants in 1994 and 1995 by promising that children of the immigrants who were in New York State prisons would be treated leniently by the State Parole Board in return.</p>

        <p>In his first public comment on a Federal inquiry into his campaign finances, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he was ''absolutely confident'' that no wrongdoing had occurred, suggesting that he was so unconcerned that he had not even spoken about it to campaign officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki acknowledged that he knew the Korean-immigrant businessman, a volunteer for the 1994 campaign, who is a target of the investigation. The United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn is examining whether the businessman, Yung Soo Yoo, and others tied to the campaign solicited contributions from at least two Korean immigrants in 1994 and 1995 by promising that children of the immigrants who were in New York State prisons would be treated leniently by the State Parole Board in return.</p>
        <p>Records show that the Parole Board did not release the two inmates after the donations were made, but prosecutors could still seek an indictment if favors were promised, even if they were not fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters after a speech in Manhattan, Mr. Pataki said he had not questioned campaign officials about Mr. Yoo, who has also been the subject of Congressional investigations into his fund-raising activities. Mr. Yoo has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates in recent years, and was a top fund-raiser for Mr. Pataki and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato until the two cut their ties to him in 1996 after his name cropped up in the fund-raising inquiries.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in my administration has acted properly and appropriately, and that's what they have to do,'' Mr. Pataki said, ''or else they wouldn't be appointed to the administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoo was convicted of fraud in the 1980's, but Mr. Pataki said he was not aware of Mr. Yoo's record when he became a fund-raiser for the campaign. Mr. Pataki also contended that had he known, he would not have appointed Mr. Yoo to the administration's transition committee after the election.</p>
        <p>After the election, Mr. Pataki attended at least one event that Mr. Yoo helped to organize, and Mr. Pataki's wife, Libby, received a gift of a Korean dog at a ceremony arranged by Mr. Yoo, according to articles in local Korean-language newspapers at the time. Mr. Pataki also promised a Korean group that he would consider using the state's work-release program to help young Korean immigrants in state prison, one article said.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato have returned donations from Mr. Yoo and some people associated with him, including the two immigrants whose children are in prison, records show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoo did not respond to telephone messages yesterday seeking comment. In an interview on Wednesday, he said his fund-raising activities were legal.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the United States Attorney's office issued grand jury subpoenas to the Pataki campaign and several of its officials, including Zenia Mucha, who is now one of Mr. Pataki's most influential aides. Officials in Albany said yesterday that the state Republican Party had also received a subpoena.</p>
        <p>The subpoena issued to the party sought copies of correspondence between the party and more than 10 donors with Asian surnames, officials involved in the inquiry said. The subpoena also sought all party documents dating back to 1992 that contain the words ''prison'' or ''loan agreement.'' The reference to ''prison'' appeared to be related to the inquiry into whether favors were promised at the Parole Board. The relevance of the reference to ''loan agreement'' could not be determined yesterday.</p>
        <p>Terry O'Brien, a spokesman for the state Republican Party, acknowledged that the party had received the subpoena, but declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoo came to the attention of Congressional investigators last year after he became involved in an inquiry into the relationship between some Korean factory owners and immigration officials in New York City. The factory owners were concerned about raids by the immigration officials, and made contributions to Mr. D'Amato's campaign in an effort to gain access to the officials.</p>
        <p>In connection with that inquiry, Congressional investigators raised questions about a $2,500 donation that Mr. Yoo made to the fund-raising arm of the Senate Republicans, which Mr. D'Amato controlled at the time, officials in Washington said. The check, dated Feb. 19, 1996, was signed by Mr. Yoo, but it included a notation that it was ''For Mr. Chong H. Hwang.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hwang was head of the Korean Apparel Manufacturers Association at the time. The investigators examined whether the notation was evidence that Mr. Yoo funneled the money to the committee for Mr. Hwang, which is illegal. The investigators concluded their inquiry without taking action on the matter.</p>
        <p>The Senate Republican fund-raising committee returned the donation in late 1996. Mr. Hwang's home phone number could not be located yesterday. No one answered the phone at the manufacturers association.</p>
