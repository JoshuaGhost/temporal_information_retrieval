        <p>Kimbell Director Is Resigning</p>
        <p>The surprise of the week in the art world is the sudden resignation of Edmund P. Pillsbury as director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, which he has run since 1980.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pillsbury met with the museum's board on Monday. He plans to leave no later than Feb. 1, 1999, giving the museum a year to find a successor.</p>
        <p>Besides being the director of the museum, he is vice president and an ex-officio member of the board of directors of the Kimbell Art Foundation, which owns and operates the museum.</p>
        <p>''It's important for the institution to have someone with fresh ideas and new leadership,'' Mr. Pillsbury said. ''I don't think I've gone totally stale,  but I've reached a plateau, and it seems like the right moment to leave.''</p>
        <p>During his tenure Mr. Pillsbury mounted many serious exhibitions, including shows devoted to Poussin, La Tour, Monet and Tiepolo. He was also responsible for refining the museum's permanent collection.</p>
        <p>Over the years his name has surfaced for many museum-director jobs, most notably at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The fact that he is only 54, has been a high-profile director for 17 years and has no job waiting for him gave his departure a mysterious air.</p>
        <p>''Ted resigned at Monday's board meeting,'' said Kay Fortson, president of the board. ''Yes, I was surprised, but change is sometimes a good thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pillsbury said that he intended to travel and write.</p>
        <p>The job of director of the Kimbell is considered a plum in museum circles because of the Kimbell's sizable endowment and enviable collection, though Mr. Pillbury's plan to expand the museum several years ago was abandoned and its growth is therefore uncertain. Mr. Pillsbury has been one of the highest paid museum directors. Four years ago, his salary was a reported $448,997.</p>
        <p>Romanovs in Brooklyn</p>
        <p>''Monet and the Mediterranean'' is going to be a hard act for the Brooklyn Museum of Art to follow. Yet even as packers were taking the Monets off the walls (the show closed on Sunday), museum officials were in the final stretch of negotiating to bring in yet another blockbuster show, ''Jewels of the Romanovs:  Treasures of the Russian Imperial Court.''</p>
        <p>The Romanov show opened last January at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, and has been traveling around the United States, making stops in Houston, San Diego and Memphis. It will now make its final American stop in Brooklyn, opening on March 20 and running through July 5.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn officials hope that like the Monet show, ''Jewels of the Romanovs'' will draw visitors who have never been to the museum before.</p>
        <p>''We are hoping to attract the enormous Russian community that lives in New York,'' said Arnold L. Lehman, the Brooklyn Museum's director. ''It's historically a very rich exhibition and one that has been popular with young people.''</p>
        <p>The show includes 250 objects. Highlights include a selection of 70 crown jewels amassed over the centuries by the Russian Imperial family.</p>
        <p>The jewels come from the Russian State Diamond Fund, one of the world's finest collections of precious stones and jewelry, stored beneath the Kremlin's armory. The show also has royal portraits, court gowns, military uniforms and jewel-encrusted objects spanning three centuries of the Romanov dynasty.</p>
        <p>Timed and dated tickets ($10 for adults and $6 for children) will be necessary and can be purchased by calling (888) 8JEWEL8.</p>
        <p>San Francisco Gift</p>
        <p>Intent on helping the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art become more than simply a neighborhood museum, Bay area collectors continue to offer support in the form of both art and money.</p>
        <p>This week the museum announced that Kent Logan, a senior managing director at Montgomery Securities,  and his wife, Vicki, had not only given the museum $1.5 million toward its endowment and operating budget, but also made a fractional gift of 250 works from their vast collection of contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Fractional gifts have tax advantages for donors like the Logans. Under the terms of the Logans' gift, the museum owns 50 percent of their collection; full ownership will be transferred to the museum within 15 years. The Logans remain in possession of all the art, except when it goes on loan to the museum for exhibitions.</p>
        <p>''This gift significantly broadens and deepens our collection,' said Gary Garrels, chief curator and curator of painting and sculpture at the museum. ''I've known for a long time that the Logans' intention was to form a collection that would eventually go to an institution, but it wasn't until they approached us in November that I knew it would go here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Logan calls his art collection, which he has been building for about five years, ''a collection of ideas about how art can reflect contemporary society.''</p>
        <p>''I began to be uncomfortable about the fact that I kept buying art which I would put in storage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The collection includes the work of more than 100 artists, among them  Warhol and de Kooning; such German artists as Gerhard Richter and Anselm Kiefer; popular names like Cindy Sherman, Kiki Smith, Damien Hirst and Bruce Nauman; local San Francisco artists like David Park and Wayne Thiebaud, and contemporary Japanese artists like Yasumasa Morimura and Tatsuo Miyajima.</p>
        <p>The gift has filled many gaps in the museum's permanent collection, adding artists like Francesco Clemente and Jean-Michel Basquiat. The gift has also broadened the scope of holdings by artists the museum already owned. The three works by Anselm Kiefer, for example, will give the museum one of the best Keifer collections in the nation.</p>
