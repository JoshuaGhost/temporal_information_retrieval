        <p>SORKIN-Charles. All of us at the East Midwood Jewish Center profoundly mourn the passing of Charles Sorkin, Honorary Trustee, long-time member, and devoted leader of our synagogue. His sincerity, decency and hard work made him a invaluable resource. We pray that God will send His blessings of comfort to his dear wife Marcia and to the entire family.
