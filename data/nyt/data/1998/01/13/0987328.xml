        <p>With the financial turmoil in Asia showing few signs of abating, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are stepping up criticism of the bailouts engineered by the Clinton Administration, putting the White House under additional pressure as it prepares to ask Congress for more money.</p>
        <p>Although the Administration has won muted support for its stance toward Asia from leaders of both parties, members of Congress at either end of the ideological spectrum have grown increasingly vocal in their objections in recent days, and seem certain to demand a full-scale debate about using American money to contain the crisis.</p>
        <p>''We must be vigilant and aware of what is taking place, but insist on discipline and thoughtful action before taxpayer dollars are put at risk,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans object to using taxpayer money to help other nations. They are particularly upset with the Administration's freedom to lend money to embattled nations without Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>The more libertarian-minded conservatives say the best approach would be to minimize the involvement of the United States and International Monetary Fund and allow the free-market system to work by penalizing the banks, securities firms, companies and countries that made bad investments. Bailouts, they say, encourage international investors to make risky bets with the confidence that governments will pay for their mistakes.</p>
        <p>''The free market is no longer at work in the field of international finance,'' said Senator Lauch Faircloth, a Republican from North Carolina, who is among the most outspoken critics of the Administration's strategy. ''We have privatized the gains and socialized the losses.''</p>
        <p>Many liberal Democrats are equally opposed to the current policy, designed mainly by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. But they object for different reasons than the Republican critics.</p>
        <p>The Democrats say the bailouts are propping up repressive regimes in nations like Indonesia that have little respect for human rights, allow exploitation of workers and condone development plans that damage the environment. In countries such as South Korea, these Democrats say the economic prescription imposed by the I.M.F. will unfairly inflict most of the pain on the middle class and allow financial institutions and international investors to escape with little damage.</p>
        <p>''Until we deal with the negative consequences we're going to oppose enhancing the international mobility of capital,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat. ''If the Administration will take seriously our concerns, it can break what must look to them like an unholy alliance between liberals and conservatives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin said the interdependence of the American and Asian economies and financial markets and the broader interest the United States has in a stable, prosperous Asia have left the United States with no choice but to help develop a solution to the crisis.</p>
        <p>''Our nation's economic and national security are vitally at stake in the situation in Asia,'' Mr. Rubin said.</p>
        <p>''There's a high level of seriousness in Congress about how to think through and deal with these matters,'' he added. ''But there certainly will be a debate and discussion when Congress reconvenes.''</p>
        <p>Congress has been out of session for the last two and a half months as the Administration has worked, through the I.M.F. and on its own, to stabilize financial markets in Asia and limit damage to the economy.</p>
        <p>But the Administration's decision just before Christmas to lend $1.7 billion of taxpayer money to South Korea galvanized longtime critics of direct American involvement in such bailouts. The failure of the I.M.F. plans throughout the region to calm the markets has brought further criticism from Congress that the White House's approach is flawed.</p>
        <p>The first flashpoint in the debate will be the Administration's request for a $3.5 billion contribution to an emergency fund established by the I.M.F. to deal with sudden financial crises of the type afflicting Asia. The request was blocked before Congress adjourned last fall -- largely because it became enmeshed with the separate but equally contentious issue of American support for international family planning efforts -- and is likely to be resubmitted to Congress in the next month or two.</p>
        <p>The Administration will also ask Congress this year for an additional $14.5 billion to bolster the I.M.F.'s financial strength under a plan agreed to last fall by the I.M.F.'s 181 member nations.</p>
        <p>Consideration of both I.M.F. requests is certain to be tied to efforts by Republicans to limit the Administration's freedom to provide direct loans to foreign nations without Congressional approval through the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a $40 billion kitty that can be used at the President's discretion to deal with international financial problems. The $1.7 billion loan for South Korea came from the stabilization fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato pushed through legislation several years ago that restricted the size and length of any loans made by the President from the stabilization fund. Those restrictions lapsed on Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans, including Mr. Faircloth, want to reimpose those restrictions. Republicans said it was likely that they would tie any new appropriations for the I.M.F. to limits on the Administration's use of the stabilization fund.</p>

        <p>Greenspan Heckled</p>
        <p>LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 (Reuters) -- Community advocates heckled the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, today for defending financial aid to Asia while poor neighborhoods in the United States needed help.</p>
        <p>''It's a disgrace,'' some shouted when the subject of Asia arose during a community financing forum attended by Mr. Greenspan. ''You should be ashamed of yourself.'' One heckler was ejected for refusing to calm down.</p>
