        <p>With the divisive search process that brought Dr. Rudy Crew to New York City in October 1995 a distant memory, the Board of Education voted unanimously yesterday to extend his contract as Schools Chancellor through July 1999, the latest date permitted under law.</p>
        <p>If Dr. Crew serves through July 1999, which would be three months shy of his four-year anniversary, he would become the longest-serving leader of the nation's largest school system in nearly two decades, since Frank J. Macchiarola, who served five years ending in 1983.</p>

        <p>With the divisive search process that brought Dr. Rudy Crew to New York City in October 1995 a distant memory, the Board of Education voted unanimously yesterday to extend his contract as Schools Chancellor through July 1999, the latest date permitted under law.</p>
        <p>If Dr. Crew serves through July 1999, which would be three months shy of his four-year anniversary, he would become the longest-serving leader of the nation's largest school system in nearly two decades, since Frank J. Macchiarola, who served five years ending in 1983.</p>
        <p>The board's renewal of the Chancellor's contract, which was set to expire in July, was loaded with political symbolism and provided ample evidence of how unified a body the board has become during Dr. Crew's 27-month tenure.</p>
        <p>It was telling that the motion to extend Dr. Crew's contract was made by Carol A. Gresser, the board member from Queens, whose ouster as board president in the summer of 1996 had the blessing of Dr. Crew and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gresser has lately sought to mend fences with the Chancellor, who has emerged as a potent political player and valuable mayoral ally. ''I am thrilled he is committing to stay with us and work with us to turn the system around,'' Mrs. Gresser said. ''We need continuity. He's providing it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew, sitting to Mrs. Gresser's right at the head of a long table inside the board's ornate meeting room in downtown Brooklyn, was visibly moved by the vote of confidence. Of his decision to accept the offer of another year at his current salary of $196,000, Dr. Crew said, ''It was an easy conversation, both with the board and inside myself.''</p>
        <p>Because the board members' three-year terms expire this July, the current board is only permitted to renew the Chancellor's contract for up to 12 additional months. But once it is seated in July, the new board will begin negotiations on a three-year extension of the Chancellor's contract, board officials said.</p>
        <p>After less than two years on the job, Dr. Crew's predecessor, Ramon C. Cortines, resigned in the summer of 1995 under pressure from Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Cortines's predecessor, Joseph A. Fernandez, was ousted by a bitterly divided board in the winter of 1993, three years after taking office, in a repudiation of his support of condom distribution and other controversial social programs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew, the former superintendent of schools in Tacoma, Wash., came to New York in the fall of 1995 as a compromise choice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew was appointed by a vote of 5 to 2, with the delegates of the Bronx and Manhattan borough presidents voting against him, in what they said was a protest vote against the search process. Yesterday, both voted in his favor.</p>
