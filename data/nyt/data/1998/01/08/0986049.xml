        <p>WHEN are curtain rods more interesting than the curtains? When they have decorative finials resembling everything from a ram's head to a Faberge egg. Russell Bush, a Manhattan interior designer, even suggests drilling a hole in a baseball or tennis ball for an unusual touch in a child's room. The right finial can also perk up a four-poster bed or stretch the height of a bookcase to make it look like a floor-to-ceiling built-in.</p>
        <p>Remember that finials are components that must fit onto other pieces of hardware: curtain rods come in varying diameters. You must measure the space between the rod and the wall. Forget the ruler, however, if you find one lovely enough to place somewhere on its own as an ornament.</p>

The right finial can also perk up a four-poster bed or stretch the height of a bookcase to make it look like a floor-to-ceiling built-in.</p>

        <p>1. Clockwise from top left: frosted plastic resin Iris finials come in orange, red, green, blue or white. They are 2 1/2 inches long and $31 each, at Gracious Home, 1220 Third Avenue (71st Street); (800) 338-7809. Wrought-iron crooks, 14 inches long, are $100 a pair at Windows, Walls and More, 1595 Second Avenue (82d Street); they also come in brushed aluminum. Deci ceramic finials in black and white, or blue and white, are $7.95 a pair at Ikea; (410) 931-8940 (for East Coast sites). Pine cones in pewter or brass are 1 7/8 inches long (top), $33 each, or 4 inches, $54, both at Gracious Home. Bright yellow rubber balls (also in orange or blue) are $2.95 a pair; iron fleurs-de-lis, $2.95 a pair, and oversize wrought-iron spirals, $8.95 a pair, all at Ikea.</p>
        <p>2. Joseph Biunno finds inspiration in everything from old earrings to cast-off architectural details. His line, Finials Unlimited, is tucked in a dusty loft at 129 West 29th Street. Cast-resin pieces can be painted, finished like wood or leafed with gold or silver. Unfinished ones (shown, $70 to $85 each) look like piano ivories. He also custom-makes any style or size in wood or resin.</p>
        <p>3. Le Decor Francais, 1006 Lexington Avenue (72d Street), has hand-carved wood finials from France. Clockwise from top left: Louis XV twist in gold leaf, $398 each; gold-leaf Chantilly knob, $450; artichoke in white with gold trim, $230; mahogany tulip, $316, and the Champbory, which at 13 inches long is as baronial as its price, $900.</p>
        <p>4. John Ragsdale, of Charleston, S.C., is inspired by Faberge eggs. Large resin finials are $130 a pair unpainted or $230 custom-painted; small ones, which can be used for cord pulls, are $12 each or $27 each, from the Ground Floor, (803) 722-3576.</p>
        <p>5. Animals and stars are among Mr. Biunno's most complex finials. Finished in imitation gold leaf, the six-inch ram's head is $260, and the star, six-and-a-half-inch Chinese dog and nine-inch elephant (its trunk is also a good coat hook) are $290 each.</p>
