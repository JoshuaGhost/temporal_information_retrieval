The building's owner is Tower Realty Trust.</p>
        <p>The move, Mr. Simone said, will allow the company to provide adequate space for the editorial group. Miller Sports Group publishes four consumer magazines, Mountain Sports and  Living (formerly Snow Country), Tennis, Sailing World and Cruising World.</p>
        <p>Miller Sports Group will occupy the fourth floor of 810 Seventh Avenue, at the northeast corner of West 52d Street.</p>
