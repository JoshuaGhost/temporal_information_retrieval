        <p>The House today unanimously approved a bill to crack down on pedophiles who use the Internet to entice children sexually, making prosecutions easier and toughening prison sentences.</p>
        <p>The bill passed 416 to 0, reflecting Congress's growing concern with cyberspace as the number of children who use the Internet continues to boom while pornography and pedophilia grow along with it. The legislation now goes to the Senate.</p>
        <p>Embraced by all sides -- Republicans, Democrats and the Clinton Administration -- the bill would prohibit ''contacting'' a minor through an on-line service, like the Internet, or engaging in sexual activity and would establish a three-year minimum sentence for using a computer to do so. Under current Federal law, prosecutors must prove that a pedophile persuaded or forced a child into a sexual act, a situation that has made convictions difficult.</p>
        <p>The bill would also make it a crime to transfer obscene materials knowingly to a minor over the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Individuals who seek children to sexually exploit and victimize them are also a mouse click away,'' said Representative Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican who worked with the Justice Department to draft the bill. ''Cyberpredators often cruise the Internet in search of lonely, curious or trusting young people.''</p>
        <p>The House vote comes at a time when law-enforcement officials are recognizing the popularity of the Internet as a vehicle to commit crimes, are stepping up their efforts to combat fraud, pornography and pedophilia in cyberspace. So far in Federal courts, there have been 450 convictions of people who have used the Internet to solicit children to engage in sexual activity or to post pornographic images, according to statistics from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>
        <p>Cyberspace poses a particular threat to children because they often sign on to the Internet unsupervised and can enter chatrooms, where computer users hold typewritten conversations. Although there is no way to know how many children are contacted by pedophiles or are exposed to pornography through the Internet, law-enforcement officials say it is a growing problem.</p>
        <p>By using the Internet, pedophiles can remain anonymous and hidden from view, making it easier to seduce children and set up meetings. Internet-savvy children can also easily access on-line pornography. The  word ''sex,'' typed into a search engine, can summon numerous listings. And while commercial sites usually require the use of a credit card, some pornography sites offer free photographs to lure customers.</p>
        <p>The bill also cracks down on serial rapists and on those who attack the elderly and the disabled.</p>
