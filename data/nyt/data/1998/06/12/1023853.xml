        <p>Don't go to Donguri.</p>
        <p>The restaurant has only 25 seats and could not survive an onslaught of New Yorkers. And yet I would feel remiss if I didn't tell you about the sweet Japanese restaurant that opened in March serving small dishes.</p>
        <p>The modest dining room feels so precisely like a place in Tokyo that it is no wonder it attracts a crowd of mostly Japanese clients. They sit drinking sake and beer as they munch on warm, salted soy beans still in the shell. Then small gifts begin appearing from the kitchen. It may be a dish of deep-fried shrimp, still in the shell, that diners pick up with their chopsticks and eat head and all, enjoying the delicious crunch of the shells. Or it may be pieces of tile fish, fried, marinated and served in rustic ceramic bowls.</p>

        <p>Don't go to Donguri.</p>
        <p>The restaurant has only 25 seats and could not survive an onslaught of New Yorkers. And yet I would feel remiss if I didn't tell you about the sweet Japanese restaurant that opened in March serving small dishes.</p>
        <p>The modest dining room feels so precisely like a place in Tokyo that it is no wonder it attracts a crowd of mostly Japanese clients. They sit drinking sake and beer as they munch on warm, salted soy beans still in the shell. Then small gifts begin appearing from the kitchen. It may be a dish of deep-fried shrimp, still in the shell, that diners pick up with their chopsticks and eat head and all, enjoying the delicious crunch of the shells. Or it may be pieces of tile fish, fried, marinated and served in rustic ceramic bowls.</p>
        <p>The menu includes all manner of dishes, from abalone and cucumber in a delightfully spicy sauce to four broiled rectangles of tofu, each topped with a different kind of miso sauce. There is vegetable tempura and marinated deep-fried chicken. If sashimi is your desire, you can choose a dish of sliced raw fish. (The varieties depend on the market but on my visit the plate included hamachi, chu toro, fluke and salmon.) Perhaps you would like some noodles? Soba is served plain or with several kinds of tempura.</p>
        <p>Donguri is the sort of restaurant where you can sit and simply order dishes until you run out of appetite. On the other hand, you could make ordering easy and simply choose one of the prix fixe meals. In either case, take your time: the kitchen is as small as the dining room.</p>
        <p>Donguri, 309 East 83d Street, Manhattan, (212) 737-5656. Prix fixe dinners, $35 and $55; dishes from $3.50 to $20.</p>
