      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>YUDOFF-Leon. Age 95. Passed away peacefully in his home in North Miami Beach, Florida on Thursday, June 11, 1998. Beloved husband of the late Anna Yudoff. Cherished father of Zena Wiener and Paul Yudoff. Adored grandfather of Jenny and Gabe Wiener and David and Jason Yudoff. He emigrated to this country in 1923 and was deeply grateful to be an American citizen. Leon devoted his life not only to his family and friends, but to the many passions he held so dear: his heritage, the United Jewish Appeal, the State of Israel, music and the arts. His love of life and great wisdom will live on forever in those fortunate enough to have known him. Funeral services Sunday 12 noon at ''The Riverside'', 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue.</p>
