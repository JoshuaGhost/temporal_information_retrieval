        <p>Nina Kowak letter, commenting on June 19 article on dismissal of Boston Globe columnist for fabricating articles, says such writers may be better off sticking to traditional fiction writing</p>

        <p>Whereas Stephen Glass, a staff writer at The New Republic, made a career out of putting one over on everybody, the lapses of judgment of Patricia Smith of The Boston Globe, who was asked to resign for fabricating people and quotations in four of her columns, probably stemmed not from trickery but from an impulse to make the stories more emotionally fulfilling for her readers (news article, June 19).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Whereas Stephen Glass, a staff writer at The New Republic, made a career out of putting one over on everybody, the lapses of judgment of Patricia Smith of The Boston Globe, who was asked to resign for fabricating people and quotations in four of her columns, probably stemmed not from trickery but from an impulse to make the stories more emotionally fulfilling for her readers (news article, June 19).</p>
        <p>You can trace such journalistic inventiveness at least as far back as Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood'' and the rise of New Journalism, and certainly through the parade of specious memoirs and flamboyant nonfiction that conveniently fill in the gaps of memory or spice up a less than perfect plot in a number of today's best sellers.</p>
        <p>It does make you wonder if such writers wouldn't be better off sticking to traditional fiction writing. That's where that kind of inventiveness belongs.</p>
