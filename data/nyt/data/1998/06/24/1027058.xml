        <p>Neil O'Donnell's brief, bizarre run as quarterback of the Jets has ended. His agent, Leigh Steinberg, came to that conclusion tonight after receiving an unexpected phone call from Coach Bill Parcells.</p>
        <p>''Bill called me and said that because of Neil's unwillingness to restructure his contract, he is talking to and pursuing other quarterbacks, which could result in Neil's release,'' a surprised Steinberg said. One of them could be Vinny Testaverde, who grew up on Long Island wanting to be a Jet.</p>
        <p>The 34-year-old Testaverde, who was cut by the Baltimore Ravens, said today that his agent ''just two days ago'' started talks with the Jets.</p>
        <p>When asked about Testaverde's remarks, Parcells said, ''We've had some talks with Vinny Testaverde and his representatives.''</p>
        <p>For now, Glenn Foley is the No. 1 quarterback, a spot he held for two games in 1997 before a season-ending knee injury. But Testaverde is good enough to battle Foley for the starting job during training camp.</p>
        <p>Last season, Testaverde produced 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions while completing 57.7 percent of his passes.</p>
        <p>That followed his best season, in 1996, when he went to the Pro Bowl while generating 33 touchdowns and 4,177 yards with only 19 interceptions. But in the off season, the Ravens traded for the Colts' Jim Harbaugh, and cut Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Since January, Parcells has attempted to induce O'Donnell to restructure the $4.2 million salary he was to earn this year. O'Donnell has steadfastly refused. Even after he is cut, though, the Jets will still be charged $2.8 million against this year's salary cap.</p>
        <p>''Neil has understood for some time there's been a difference of opinion,'' Steinberg said. ''But he was hoping his tenure would be much longer.''</p>
        <p>O'Donnell joined the Jets in 1996, shortly after leading the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl. He signed a five-year deal worth a potential $25 million. But in the first year he suffered a shoulder tear after six games. And when he was finally ready to return, he went into a routine backpedal in practice and tore his calf.</p>
        <p>Last year, he was benched in consecutive weeks and replaced by Foley, who eventually became the starter after leading the club to victory as a backup. Foley himself was injured, though, and O'Donnell returned to lead the Jets in the final five games.</p>
        <p>Still, Parcells, who has been reserved in praising O'Donnell, felt he was overpaid and told him not to attend the recent off-season workout that the coach demands of every other player. The stated reason was that if O'Donnell were injured, the club might be responsible for his salary.</p>
        <p>O'Donnell's last game as a Jet steeled his resolve when he didn't take the fall for a 13-10 loss to the Lions in the regular-season finale that cost New York a playoff berth. He was lifted several times for trick plays by the mobile Ray Lucas and Leon Johnson, who both threw interceptions.</p>
        <p>Afterward, O'Donnell told friends, ''they can't pin that loss on me.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde, meanwhile, seemed reluctant today to say that there was a good chance he would be a Jet. ''Certainly if I had a chance to play for Bill Parcells, that would be a great opportunity for me, knowing his past in taking teams to the Super Bowl,'' said Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Parcells's phone call surprised Steinberg, who also represents Foley. A few hours earlier, Steinberg contended, ''It's been pretty clear to me the entire off season that Neil O'Donnell is coming back. ''My assumption is that the quarterbacks of the New York Jets will be Glenn Foley and Neil O'Donnell and someone who's third.''</p>
        <p>Speaking today during a practice round for the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic, which begins Wednesday, Testaverde said he would not discount the possibility of being a backup, ''if the club has a good defense and seems to be going somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, Jets insiders had been saying that Parcells had no interest in Testaverde. However, there doesn't appear to be another quarterback out there. And it doesn't seem likely Parcells is willing to go with his untested third-stringers, Ray Lucas or Chuck Clements.</p>
        <p>In his career, Testaverde has completed 55.1 percent of his passes, thrown for 29,223 yards, and tossed 175 touchdowns to 183 interceptions.</p>
        <p>''I played well when I was under Bill Belichick in Cleveland,'' said Testaverde, referring to Parcells's second-in-command. The quarterback, who grew up in Elmont, N.Y., and starred at Sewanhaka High School, added, ''Me being from Long Island, I'd be coming home.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>BLAKE SPENCE, a fifth-round tight end from Oregon, signed with the Jets. He was a prominent receiver in college, and said he thought the Jets ''hope their tight ends can split the middle and get deep on the linebackers.''</p>
