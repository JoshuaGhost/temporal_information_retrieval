        <p>In the latest gun-related incident in the public schools, the police in New Providence discovered a shotgun under the bed of a 15-year-old boy accused of threatening his English teacher after she gave him an assignment he did not like.</p>
        <p>The boy, a student at New Providence High School in Union County, told the teacher on Thursday, ''On days like these, I wish I could go home and get my gun and have some fun,'' according to police Capt. Douglas R. Marvin. After the teacher took the boy into a hallway to speak with him, he put his clasped hands together like a gun and, while the teacher watched, mimicked the sound of a pistol report, Captain Marvin said.</p>

        <p>The boy, a student at New Providence High School in Union County, told the teacher on Thursday, ''On days like these, I wish I could go home and get my gun and have some fun,'' according to police Capt.

        <p>The police searched the student's home and found the gun beneath his bed; they also found a sawed-off shotgun, two handguns, three knives, empty shotgun shells and a hashish pipe in the bedroom of the student's older brother, Captain Marvin said. The police confiscated the weapons and charged the 15-year-old, whose name was not released, with making terroristic threats. He is to remain suspended from school until he undergoes a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
