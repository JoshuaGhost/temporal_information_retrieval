        <p>BOB and Margaret are mildly pathetic. Bob whines about his dentistry career. (''Hardly anyone flosses any more,'' he says. ''What's the point?'') Margaret, a podiatrist with horizontal hair, can't feed the dogs without throwing out her back. And Bob never knows when to shut up. Like the time he wandered through the house without his pants on, rattling on about whether it was too late to have children and declaring ''All our friends are boring.'' (Unfortunately all their friends were hiding behind the living room furniture at the time, poised to leap out and shout ''Surprise!'' for Bob's 40th birthday.)</p>
        <p>And somebody thought Americans couldn't identify with these people?</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night at 10:30, ''Bob and Margaret,'' an animated series about a British couple, created by a Canadian husband and a British wife, will have its premiere on Comedy Central. And although producers urged the creators to have Bob and Margaret move to the United States or at least take up with some American friends, the couple, their social circle and the show remain firmly rooted in London.</p>
        <p>''We live in London, and we wanted to use stories from our personal experience,'' said David Fine, 37, who is from Toronto. ''And we wanted to be true to the short.''</p>
        <p>''Bob and Margaret'' began as a 12-minute film made by Mr. Fine and his wife, Alison Snowden, 40, who grew up in Nottingham, England. When the film won the Oscar for best animated short in 1995, television producers from England, Canada and the United States approached the couple with proposals to turn the offbeat characters into a series. As it turns out, ''Bob and Margaret'' is multinational: a co-presentation of Comedy Central, England's Channel 4 and a Canadian company, Nelvana. The series will have its Canadian and British television premieres in the fall.</p>
        <p>Some would argue that in the premillennial global village, a middle-aged urban professional couple is a middle-aged urban professional couple, no matter where they live. But Ms. Snowden believes Bob and Margaret are British in some specific ways.</p>
        <p>''They don't express themselves so well,'' she says. ''And they're not in complete control of their lives. An American couple might be slightly more assertive.''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe.</p>
        <p>Still it's hard not to feel a certain kinship with a married couple who, virtually forced to take up a fitness program, choose doubles badminton. Margaret is furious when Bob tells a visiting chiropractor how slothful she is. ''You're just as lazy as I am,'' she reminds her husband later in the privacy of their kitchen. ''That's what attracted us to each other in the first place.''</p>
        <p>British or not, the couple is being called Seinfeldian by some. Maybe that's because they don't always seem like such nice people. When Bob and Margaret's house is burgled and it's time to fill out the insurance forms, they enthusiastically list elaborate electronics they never owned. And when sitting at the hospital bedside of a comatose acquaintance, Bob doesn't hesitate to dig into the patient's dinner tray. Well, he rationalizes, the patient isn't going to be eating it while he's in a coma, is he?</p>
        <p>This strikes Bob as a good time to discuss the patient's girlfriend. ''She can never keep a boyfriend for more than two weeks,'' he says. ''And have you noticed? They're always such wimps.'' Naturally the patient wakes up while Bob is talking. And Bob and Margaret are at the hospital only because they couldn't think of a polite way to leave.</p>
        <p>Comedy Central has high hopes for this imperfect couple and has scheduled them right after ''Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist,'' another animated series about adults with problems. In the weeks ahead, viewers will enter a world in which everyone has a discolored nose the size of a guava. (Ms. Snowden insists the characters' noses are ''peachy pink,'' but they're definitely several shades off the overall skin tone.) The world is also inhabited by William and Elizabeth, Bob and Margaret's peculiarly synchronized dogs who exhibit lots of manic energy and some oddly human arm movements. In the first episode, Bob will go through a business crisis when a charming, handsome young dental surgeon with a fresh Cambridge degree sets up a practice across the street and begins stealing all of Bob's patients.</p>
        <p>Most important, say the creators, viewers will come to understand what impressively dull people Bob and Margaret are. ''Despite the fact that they live in one of the most exciting cities in the world,'' says Mr. Fine, and Ms. Snowden finishes his sentence: ''They can't think of anything to do.''</p>
