        <p>PARADISE, PIECE BY PIECE</p>
        <p>By Molly Peacock.</p>
        <p>337 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Riverhead Books. $23.95.</p>
        <p>''When I was 3,'' reads Molly Peacock's opening chapter, in its entirety, ''I decided not to have children.'' But, of course, it isn't quite that simple. The premise of her latest book, ''Paradise, Piece by Piece,'' is that for women childlessness always needs to be accounted for -- and Peacock, the author of four books of poetry and a former president of the Poetry Society of America, sets out to do exactly that. In what she calls a ''hybrid memoir,'' she blends real and invented characters to explain how, as a successful writer and a happily married woman who has spent a considerable part of her adult life working with children, she has ended up having none of her own.</p>
        <p>The book does not present an overtly feminist argument, nor does it present, in spite of the epigraph from Gandhi (''A No uttered from deepest conviction is better and greater than a Yes merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble''), what one would consider a single emphatic decision. Rather, it shows, as the author herself remarks, her evolution to a certain state of mind:</p>
        <p>''As it turns out, my choice not to have children has defined my adult life. It's been like hacking through undergrowth while walking down a hardly used, perfectly paved way. . . . In fact, on that path my choice not to be a mother became more of a discovery of a decision. . . . It took insight to see and release it -- an insight I didn't always have. For this is a decision you do not make once, but many times. I would leave the idea of not having children behind, only to face it again and again as I went on.''</p>
        <p>This early passage reveals what may be a problem for some readers: the degree to which (as she moves from ''my'' to ''you'' and back again to ''I'') Peacock seems to offer an argument larger than her individual circumstances -- namely, that many women who do not have children are too damaged either physically or emotionally to do so. From this perspective, the notion that two of her closest women friends, Maggie and Lily, both childless for various reasons, are in fact composite characters is a disturbing one. In spite of Peacock's initial explanation, it's easy to forget while reading that these feisty women are not drawn directly from life but are apparently constructs in her argument about childbearing.</p>
        <p>But I am doing Peacock a disservice in suggesting that her book is all argument. What will stay with most readers, I think, is the vivid picture she paints of the loneliness women often feel in dealing with the social pressures concerning motherhood and, of necessity, contraception (a pressure none of the childless men in Peacock's life seem to feel when it comes to fatherhood), and how sadly difficult it remains for women to combine professional or artistic ambitions with having a child.</p>
        <p>In the tradition of Frank McCourt and Mary Karr, Peacock offers a sensually detailed account of her childhood in Buffalo, where her father, an alcoholic, worked for an electric company. Most telling for Peacock's argument is not her accounts of sibling rivalry or the admonition of the adults never to have children (unless she wants to), but her own early encounters with motherhood.</p>
        <p>When Molly is 12, her mother buys a little grocery store and leaves her in charge of her younger sister, Gail, not to mention the cooking and cleaning. More than 30 years later, the dying Gail addresses her sister as Mommy. ''There it was,'' Peacock writes, ''as it always had been. The bud of motherhood caught in the bulb. Part of me said, You can't, you can't do this! and the larger part that was stable as a house said, 'Sure, you can call me Mommy.' After all, it would only be for a little while.''</p>
        <p>By sheer force of will, Peacock extricates herself from her fractious family and goes away to college. There she is befriended by the fictionalized Maggie and Lily, and, albeit with much guilt, increasingly manages to distance herself from her mother and her troubled sister. A first marriage serves as a cocoon from which she gradually emerges into the world of poetry. She gets a divorce, studies at Johns Hopkins and eventually moves to New York.</p>
        <p>Throughout the memoir, Peacock is unabashedly frank about sexual matters, and we learn more about her than many of us know (or want to know) about our best friends. Thus she describes her Hungarian lover, Tilla, with his ''odalisque'' calm and ''clean barrel chest'' with its ''pink nipples planted in pectoral muscles which were almost rectangular,'' as he tests her own breasts like fruit at the market: '' 'Beautiful,' he whispered. He didn't seem to be lying. He had a kind of surrender in his eyes. 'Lie back for me,' he suggested, and held my chin in his hand as he kissed me. . . . As he had told me, he knew my body better than I did.''</p>
        <p>This level of detail serves her well in describing her struggles with contraception, which play a crucial role in her final resolution not to have children. When Peacock fails to use her diaphragm and accidentally becomes pregnant, she and Tilla have long, agonized conversations about whether to become parents. It is soon apparent that Tilla is unprepared to be a full-time father or a steady wage earner, and Peacock decides to have an abortion. The procedure leaves her feeling broken. ''I'm in a mental wheelchair,'' she tells her therapist. ''I look normal, but I'm not.'' Subsequently, she becomes allergic to the contraceptive jelly she uses with her diaphragm. At the age of 41, she decides that ''having children won't define who I am'' and has a tubal ligation.</p>
        <p>Like other contemporary memoirists, Peacock describes her suffering from a place of safety. After finally breaking free of Tilla, she reconnects with her high school sweetheart, a Joyce scholar named Michael Groden. Fortunately, he has no yearning for sons or daughters. They marry -- ''Happiness presided over our union in a whimsical wholeness'' -- and he supports her through the deaths by cancer of first her mother, then her sister. By the time the memoir ends, Peacock's small family, except for a few cousins, is gone.</p>
        <p>Yet she and her husband seem to have weathered the storms. Whatever our views about a woman's need to justify her decision not to have children, it's hard not to be cheered by Peacock's account of winning through to the pleasures of mature love.</p>
