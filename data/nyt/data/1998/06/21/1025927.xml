        <p>Every season, designers set out to please their customers, the press and themselves - not necessarily in that order - and every season their efforts are presented in a monthlong fashion cavalcade that begins in Milan, continues in Paris and ends in New York. If you had to pick just one outfit, the best of each collection, what would it be? Well, it depends on whom you ask. We asked retailers and designers to tell us their favorites for fall 1998, then compared them with our own. The results were surprising: never once was there total agreement, and even the instance of two alike out of three was remarkably low. Which just goes to show that there is more than one way to look at what's happening in fashion now, that there is plenty of room for different interests and different points of view.</p>

        <p>So the ''message'' this season is really several messages, from which we can all pick and choose: simple, straightforward tailoring; a cerntain delicacy, expressed in the details; a return to romantic extravagance, for evening; luxurious fabrics - cashmere, leather, suede, fur trim - combined; gray, for day and night. The guided tour of Milan and Paris begins here, with Marc Jacobs's Paris debut, his first collection for Louis Vuitton. Next week, New York.</p>
