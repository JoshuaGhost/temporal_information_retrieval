        <p>RICHARD SANTORO plans to spend most of Father's Day with his family at his parents' house in Lakewood. ''If we have time, maybe, we'll all see 'Godzilla,' '' he mused.</p>
        <p>No matter what the activities, he said, he will not let either of his two school-age children out of his sight, even for a minute.</p>
        <p>Last July, Mr. Santoro, the vice president for security at the Trump Taj Mahal casino hotel, was ''completely devastated'' when he learned that a 7-year-old had been kidnapped and murdered after being left unattended at a Nevada casino while her parents gambled.</p>
        <p>''Almost every day,'' he said, ''I see and hear of situations where the parents who have driven in for the day park the kids, usually on the fringes of the casino area, and say, 'Stay here while Mommy and Daddy gamble.' Or, if they're guests, they leave the kids in the hotel rooms without a baby sitter, and they think they'll be O.K. with the television set on. Then the parents wander off, not thinking that their kids could be a target for who knows what.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santoro has devised a policy for dealing with lost, unattended or missing children within casino hotels. It was endorsed for adoption citywide by Brad Smith, chairman of the Casino Control Commissioner, on Tuesday at a meeting of casino and law enforcement officers at the Atlantic City Convention Center.</p>
        <p>That policy directs any Taj Mahal employee to ask children 12 or under who seem to have been left unattended where their parents are. If the children cannot find their parents or have not been in contact with them for more than an hour, a security employee will stay with them while the parents are found. If parents cannot be found after an hour, the casino may call the police. Parents who persist in neglecting their children can be ejected from the casino.</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal's policy was derived from consultations with the security, legal, hotel operations and maintenance departments, and with the Casino Control Commission, Mr. Santoro said.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that the lawyers made us aware of was that by coming up with a policy, we were opening ourselves to lawsuits that could accuse us of being either too aggressive or not aggressive enough in following our own procedures,'' he said. ''I decided that the risk was worth it.</p>
        <p>''Priority No. 1 has to be the safety of our visitors and employees. We get 30,000 people coming through the Taj every day. If just one of those people did something bad to a kid in any way, the casino would take it hard; the city would take it hard; the entire industry would take it hard, and me, a father with two kids, I don't know how I would be able to live with myself.''</p>
        <p>Atlantic City has a curfew requiring children 17 and under to be indoors under adult supervision from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. The city has had no reports of missing or abducted children in 20 years of legal gambling, said Police Detective Joseph LaTorre.</p>
        <p>Yet the potential for such a problem ''remains significant,'' Mr. Santoro said. ''In 95 percent of the situations when we have to track down a parent and say as nicely as we can, 'You left your children unsupervised and unattended; please don't do this again,' we are not treated warmly by that parent. We are not hugged. The abuse our employees have had to take from parents has been so outrageous that about five times a month, we've had to eject parents from the premises. I'm happy to say that I've been backed up by the management on this 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santoro, who has worked in security in Atlantic City and Las Vegas for 20 years, said a majority of parents who leave their children unattended are day-trippers who are not staying at the hotel and do not take advantage of child-care services that the Taj Mahal provides for additional fees.</p>
        <p>Many are also ''from different ethnic groups, mostly Asian or Middle Eastern, who may not speak English,'' he said. For that reason, he doesn't think signs and brochures encouraging parents to keep track of their children -- a suggestion of the Virginia-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children -- will make his job any easier.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who is responsible enough going to read a brochure is going to want to comply,'' he said. ''Parents who ignore their kids are irresponsible. I don't care what kind of gamblers they are. We don't want their business.''</p>
