        <p>Six months after Iran's President, Mohammad Khatami, extended a small olive branch to the United States, the Clinton Administration responded with the offer of a ''road map'' to normalized relations between the two countries. The offer came in a speech by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright almost two decades after Iran's Islamic revolution took American diplomats hostage and made a breakup with Washington inevitable. Exactly why the Administration decided to make the gesture now  was not disclosed. But the United States, stunned by nuclear bomb tests  in India and then Pakistan, and losing its foothold on Iraqi sanctions, may have noticed that it has no leverage in Iran, another potential nuclear nation.</p>

        <p>The Iranians were neither overjoyed nor grateful. Their officials responded with the opinion that they would like to see some deeds to go with the words. In her speech, Ms. Albright  said nothing new about American efforts to isolate Iran economically.</p>
