        <p>For months now, the campaign posters and rallies for Horacio Serpa of the Liberal Party have championed him as the presidential candidate best able to negotiate an end to the civil conflict that has virtually dismembered this Andean nation, leaving some 31,000 dead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serpa's campaign has promised that this former Interior Minister, who is from the working-class oil port of Barrancabermeja, could draw on his ties to the political left to find the elusive path to peace.</p>
        <p>The only risk to this election strategy, political analysts warned, was it might make Mr. Serpa appear overly friendly toward the rebels and undermine his credibility with the military and business elite.</p>
        <p>But in these final days of campaigning for the election of a successor to President Ernesto Samper on Sunday, the two main rebel groups  issued stinging criticisms of Mr. Serpa.</p>
        <p>The biggest group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym FARC, blamed him for the breakdown in peace talks with the Government six years ago, and accused him  of waving the banner of peace solely for electoral gain.</p>
        <p>In a move worthy of his nickname  (''Sure Shot''), Manuel Marulanda, a rebel leader who had not been photographed publicly in 10 years, held talks at his secret hideout with a representative of Mr. Serpa's Conservative Party rival, Andres Pastrana, and allowed a picture of the meeting to be published in newspapers here.</p>
        <p>The smaller National Liberation Army criticized both candidates.</p>
        <p>The surprising turnaround in the two candidates' stands as peace negotiators is only the latest in a series of strange twists in the election that will end the presidency of Mr.  Samper, who has spent most of his  turbulent term fending off accusations that Cali drug dealers financed his election. In the first round of the election, on May 31, Mr. Serpa won 34.64 percent of the votes and Mr. Pastrana 34.32 percent.</p>
        <p>If the bywords of the candidates  have been ''peace'' and ''change,'' the word political analysts here frequently resort to is ''paradoxical.''</p>
        <p>While the country is reeling in almost every sense after four years of Mr. Samper -- economically, socially and politically -- the leading candidate in voter surveys until today has been Mr. Samper's staunchest defender and hand-picked successor, Mr. Serpa.</p>
        <p>In his letter of resignation as Mr. Samper's Interior Minister last year,  Mr. Serpa wrote, ''You, Mr. President, have set an example of equanimity, dignity and patriotism, and under your leadership the Government will, with good fortune, overcome the enormous challenges that have arisen.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Serpa said in a pre-election debate that he would not rule out extraditing his former boss to the United States should Washington seek this.</p>
        <p>By contrast Mr. Pastrana, whom voters might have thought more likely to surrender the unpopular President to the American authorities, rejected extradition.</p>
        <p>In a final voter survey published in the daily El Tiempo today, the two candidates were tied, with Mr. Pastrana leading by less than 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana, 44, who is favored by the business community here, is the son of former President Misael Pastrana. A former Mayor of Bogota, he could, in theory, make the most convincing case for offering Colombia a fresh start, since he has been out of government for the last four years.</p>
        <p>His television campaign advertisements list the violence, corruption and other troubles of Colombia over the last four years with Mr. Samper's face gradually fading into that of Mr. Serpa.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pastrana lacks the charisma of Mr. Serpa, 55, who has managed to put the Conservatives on the defensive by predicting that he will privatize state industries. Mr. Pastrana has been reduced to pledging his opposition to privatization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana has produced a more detailed peace proposal than Mr. Serpa. As part of a settlement, he has proposed ending the use of herbicides to kill drug crops, calling instead for an internationally backed  plan to offer coca-growing peasants alternative ways to earn a living.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana lacks the media backing and the Government support enjoyed by Mr. Serpa. The Government ombudsman's recent review of election campaign coverage  showed television stations, which depend on the Government for their operating licenses, giving substantially more air time to Mr. Serpa.</p>
        <p>Noemi Sanin, an independent presidential candidate whose unexpectedly strong showing in the first round of voting has turned her into an arbiter of political morality, has also denounced the Samper Government for doling out free publicity to Mr. Serpa on the Government-run television station and for publicly supporting his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanin, whose 2.6 million votes could provide the winning margin for Mr. Pastrana, has declined to support either candidate.</p>
        <p>Jorge A. Castro, a 59-year-old egg wholesaler, said he supported Mr. Serpa because ''he knows our country's problems.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Serpa was not responsible for some of them, Mr. Castro gathered up a handful of coins. He picked out a silver-colored coin to represent Mr. Samper, as the chief who was responsible for his Government's actions, and a brass one to represent Mr. Serpa.</p>
        <p>''See, they're not even the same color,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The most pressing issue, along with the economic troubles, has been negotiating an end to the conflict that the military here has been unable to win in the last 30 years.</p>
        <p>Each candidates has said that if elected, he would take charge of negotiations with the guerrillas, with Mr. Pastrana adding on Friday that he would seek a meeting with Mr. Marulanda, the FARC leader, next week. Both candidates have said they would agree to a guerrilla demand for the withdrawal of Government security forces from five municipalities as a requirement for negotiations.</p>
        <p>But it was Mr. Samper's agreement to pull back troops from the five municipalities, a move that the  rebels had been seeking unsuccessfully for three years, that prompted  the rebels' public attack on Mr. Serpa.</p>
        <p>''Now, with electoral ends to win votes and guarantee the triumph of Dr. Serpa,'' President Samper ''offers to evacuate,'' said a communique from the rebels, which also criticized Mr. Serpa's record as a peacemaker over the last 12 years.</p>
        <p>As chief peace negotiator under President Cesar Gaviria, the rebels say, Mr. Serpa closed peace talks in Mexico, ushering in the ''total war'' offensive against the guerrillas. As Interior Minister under Mr. Samper, he saw the creation of armed citizen's defense groups known as convivirs, which the guerrillas and human rights groups both contended were mechanisms to legalize paramilitary death squads.</p>
        <p>A Colombian court has now ruled the defense groups illegal.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Serpa said he would name Alvaro Uribe Velez, the former Governor of Antioquia who led the creation of defense groups around Medellin, as his Defense Minister, apparently in an effort to establish his credentials among the military and conservative landowners.</p>
        <p>''There's a rhetoric of peace, but in practice there's been an increase in terror while he's been in government,'' said Carlos Franco, a former guerrilla of the Marxist April 19 Movement, known as the M-19, who has joined other political figures to support Mr. Pastrana. ''I think all this led the FARC to conclude that Serpa's chances of negotiating peace were low.''</p>
