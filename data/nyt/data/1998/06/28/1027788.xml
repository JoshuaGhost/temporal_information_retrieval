        <p>WHEN in 1983 several Roman Catholic Religious Orders in the New York City area decided on moral ground -- opposition to the practice of apartheid -- to divest their stock holdings in corporations doing business with South Africa, a question about money arose. ''What are we going to do with the proceeds from the stock, which amounted to $325,000,'' said George C. Schmitz, a brother of the Holy Cross, a French religious order with American headquarters in New Rochelle. The answer they came up with was, ''Let's put it to use in our own communities at the disposal of nonprofit organizations working with the poor.''</p>
        <p>And so the Leviticus 25:23 Alternative Fund was founded as a nonprofit community development revolving loan fund by several religious members of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment. The name of the fund was taken from the Book of Leviticus, in which God calls the people to a jubilee that restores the earth and protects common lands as well as the poor. The charter members of the fund were 27 Catholic religious orders, including 11 from Westchester, which were coalition members. The concept of the revolving loan fund, an offshoot of the divestment strategy, was that its members should pool their money and invest it locally, providing loans at below-market value to community organizations that were striving to meet the basic human needs of the poor, said Mr. Schmitz, the fund's first paid employee.</p>

        <p>WHEN in 1983 several Roman Catholic Religious Orders in the New York City area decided on moral ground -- opposition to the practice of apartheid -- to divest their stock holdings in corporations doing business with South Africa, a question about money arose. ''What are we going to do with the proceeds from the stock, which amounted to $325,000,'' said George C. Schmitz, a brother of the Holy Cross, a French religious order with American headquarters in New Rochelle. The answer they came up with was, ''Let's put it to use in our own communities at the disposal of nonprofit organizations working with the poor.''</p>
        <p>And so the Leviticus 25:23 Alternative Fund was founded as a nonprofit community development revolving loan fund by several religious members of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment. The name of the fund was taken from the Book of Leviticus, in which God calls the people to a jubilee that restores the earth and protects common lands as well as the poor. The charter members of the fund were 27 Catholic religious orders, including 11 from Westchester, which were coalition members. The concept of the revolving loan fund, an offshoot of the divestment strategy, was that its members should pool their money and invest it locally, providing loans at below-market value to community organizations that were striving to meet the basic human needs of the poor, said Mr. Schmitz, the fund's first paid employee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitz was recruited to become the fund's executive director 13 years ago while he was serving as  director of international students at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. ''Before that I was the principal of a Catholic high school in Connecticut,'' he said. ''That's where I gained my business experience.</p>
        <p>''Membership in the Leviticus Fund is open to faith-based organizations, which support our mission of socially motivated lending through alternative investment.</p>
        <p>''Combining financial return with social concern is our motto. Member organizations make a minimum loan of $5,000 to the fund for five years, in return for which they receive an annual interest rate of 2 percent. Currently, we have 78 members, 13 in Westchester, and they represent 4 religious denominations, including Episcopal, United Methodist and Reformed Church as well as Roman Catholic. Individuals can also participate -- associate members who make a minimum loan of $1,000 to the fund for one year. Their interest rate is also 2 percent, far below a conventional investment where they might be expected to earn 5 percent or more. So you see that members and associates of Leviticus Fund place as much importance on the social return on their loan as they do on the financial return.''</p>
        <p>The fund's first loan, made in 1984, was for $10,000 to a sweat equity group, which was converting a tenement into 16 housing units on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. ''Since then, we've closed 96 loans, totaling over $4 million, loans that have been instrumental in leveraging over $37 million in public and private dollars for our 68 borrowers,'' Mr. Schmitz said. ''Twenty-one of the loans we've made have been to organizations in Westchester. To date, our lending in Westchester totals $12 million.''</p>
        <p>The loans have aided the development of 540 affordable-housing units, 9 day-care centers and 4 small businesses. When asked about the fund's losses, Mr. Schmitz said they were modest. ''In 15 years, we've only had to write off $58,000, or 1.3 percent, which I think makes us the envy of any conventional lender.''</p>
        <p>The Leviticus Fund, which is not government regulated, Mr. Schmitz said, is a patient lender. ''We can be more flexible than conventional lenders,'' he said. ''We make allowances for extenuating circumstances. For instance, if borrowers run into unforeseen difficulties and need more time, we will work with them to develop repayment schedules.''</p>
        <p>If such a considerate approach does not sound businesslike, nothing could be further from the truth, said  G. Anthony Hoeltzel, an Episcopal priest and executive director of the Sharing Community in Yonkers, a borrower from the fund. He is also a member of the board of the Leviticus Alternative Fund.</p>
        <p>''The business practices of the fund are conducted on a high, professional level,'' he said. ''Borrowers must supply a well-documented business plan. The risk level comes under serious review, and there must be someone responsible and knowledgeable at the head of the borrowing organization.''</p>
        <p>The Sharing Community has received two loans from the fund, one in 1993 and another in 1995, both to buy property in Yonkers to build affordable housing for single people who are homeless.</p>
        <p>''Leviticus Fund is an absolutely fantastic organization that closes a critical gap in the system,'' Mr. Hoeltzel said. ''Ours is a common problem. Although we had a $2.5 million grant from the state for two buildings for permanent and transient residents, the catch was that we needed about $250,000 in order to buy the land, get approval for the building plan and the license. The way the state grant award was constructed was that we had to have all those things in place before the state money kicked in. Without the loan from Leviticus, it's hard to imagine what we would have done.''</p>
        <p>The 1995 loan was a bridge loan, which has already been repaid, Mr. Hoeltzel said, ''The 1993 loan was converted into a six-year construction loan,'' he said. ''The buildings, six stories high -- two stories for transient residents and four stories for permanent residents. Every person has a private room and bath. Two people share apartments. Tenants come from all walks of life. We've had former cops, divorced women ranging in age from 25 to 65. Men and women are equally divided, and rents are based on whatever the recipients receive from Social Services.''</p>
        <p>The Sharing Community also provides job-training counseling and  other programs to those in need.</p>
        <p>What is heartening, Mr. Hoeltzel said, is the turnover in permanent residents, which is ''100 percent since we opened the doors.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''What it means is that we have succeeded in helping people find their way back into the mainstream. They find jobs, and they leave and set up their own homes.''</p>
        <p>In January, Leviticus started a $920,000 program to make low-interest loans to day-care centers. ''It is in response to a study that showed an increased demand for child-care centers because of welfare reform,'' Mr. Schmitz said. ''The loans provide construction financing and working capital for startups and funding to expand and upgrade other child-care centers.''</p>
        <p>Citibank, Chase Manhattan and the Republic National Bank have given grants and loans to the program. To be eligible for a loan of up to $150,000, a child-care center must be licensed by the state, with at least 50 percent of the children from low-income families. Nonprofit and for-profit organizations are eligible. The loans carry a 5 percent interest rate, well below the prime rate of 8.5 percent. ''The rate has been set deliberately low to help those in an industry that traditionally operates on a low profit level,'' Mr. Schmitz said.</p>
        <p>A program allowing minority businesses and female business owners to borrow up to $25,000, at 2 points over prime, has also been started, Mr. Schmitz said.</p>
        <p>''In order to be considered for a loan, potential borrowers must present a business plan they have developed through a program such as the one given by the Small Business Development Corporation,'' he explained.</p>
