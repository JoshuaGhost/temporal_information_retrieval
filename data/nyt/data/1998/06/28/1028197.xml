        <p>Article on Juan Gonzalez of Texas Rangers and Sammy Sosa of Chicago Cubs notes that Gonzalez has 96 runs batted in this season and could break Hack Wilson's record of 190 in 1930; notes that Sosa has hit 23 home runs in his last 28 games and has 32 for season; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Together for the first three years of their professional careers, they saw their paths diverge for a decade only to merge again this year. Sammy Sosa and Juan Gonzalez play for different teams, indeed in different leagues, but they are together again in the so-far-successful pursuit of the primary goals they set last winter.</p>
        <p>Sosa has shattered a home run record that not even Mark McGwire could reach, but the ''3'' at the start of his batting average is at least as impressive. ''Sammy told me several times, 'I want to hit .300,' '' said Jeff Pentland, the Chicago Cubs' hitting coach. ''He said, 'I did it once, and I want to do it again.' I've learned in dealing with the talent I've been lucky to deal with that if they make a statement, you have to believe in what they say they're going to do. When these guys set their minds to it, that's what results.''</p>

        <p>Together for the first three years of their professional careers, they saw their paths diverge for a decade only to merge again this year. Sammy Sosa and Juan Gonzalez play for different teams, indeed in different leagues, but they are together again in the so-far-successful pursuit of the primary goals they set last winter.</p>
        <p>Sosa has shattered a home run record that not even Mark McGwire could reach, but the ''3'' at the start of his batting average is at least as impressive. ''Sammy told me several times, 'I want to hit .300,' '' said Jeff Pentland, the Chicago Cubs' hitting coach. ''He said, 'I did it once, and I want to do it again.' I've learned in dealing with the talent I've been lucky to deal with that if they make a statement, you have to believe in what they say they're going to do. When these guys set their minds to it, that's what results.''</p>
        <p>Gonzalez set his mind to a different kind of goal. ''Juan has set some high personal goals for himself,'' said Doug Melvin, the Texas Rangers' general manager. ''Staying healthy and playing every day is probably the No. 1 goal he set out to achieve. He's done that.''</p>
        <p>Sosa is hitting ..326, and Gonzalez, his teammate from Sarasota, Gastonia, Charlotte and Tulsa when both were in the Texas organization, has played in every one of the Rangers' 80 games.</p>
        <p>It was no secret that Gonzalez would produce impressive statistics if he avoided injury, which had forced him to miss 112 of 469 games the past three seasons. In those years, he drove in a total of 357 runs in 357 games. This year, he has performed even more productively.</p>
        <p>In his first 80 games, Gonzalez drove in 96 runs, stirring talk of the pursuit of the record for runs batted in (190) as a subplot to the chase for the home run record.</p>
        <p>Sosa planted himself firmly in the latter race with a torrent of home runs this month. But the home runs did not detract from his .300 goal. During a 22-game stretch in which he hit 21 home runs (May 25 to June 21), Sosa batted .352.</p>
        <p>In his first eight seasons in the major leagues, Sosa batted .300 only once, finishing precisely at that level in 1994. Had it not been for the players' strike that ended that season prematurely, Sosa would very likely have fallen below that mark. His highest average otherwise was .273, which he hit in 1996, and his career average before this season was .257.</p>
        <p>''Sammy and I sat down in the winter and put together some goals,'' said Pentland, who joined the Cubs last July. ''I said 100 walks and 100 runs scored, and Sammy threw in .300. He was vehement about it. We made out a plan to accomplish that goal. We didn't talk about home runs, and we didn't talk about r.b.i.'s.''</p>
        <p>Sosa ''had a burning desire to be as good as he could be,'' Pentland said. ''That's one of the ingredients you need to reach greatness.''</p>
        <p>Sosa also needed to do a better job of reading and recognizing pitches, shorten his swing ''and try not to hit the ball 700 feet,'' Pentland said.</p>
        <p>''Billy Williams did a great job with his swing,'' Pentland said, referring to the team's dugout coach. ''My job was to make him aware of how good he could be.''</p>
        <p>Pentland described Sosa as a very emotional person. ''The idea is to channel that,'' Pentland said. ''Last year he wasn't happy. I never found out any reasons, but we guessed that the burden he felt he had to carry was part of it. There were some petty jealousies on the club. When a team is losing, people tend to point fingers, and a lot of the time he felt the finger was pointed at him.''</p>
        <p>The final element in the evolution of this .300 hitter, Pentland explained, was the need for Sosa to evaluate himself daily.</p>
        <p>''He never did it consistently in the past,'' the coach said. ''Now he's maintaining it. He understands himself better. I've hardly said five words. I just listen. He's saying all the right things, and it's showing up on the field.''</p>
        <p>The self-evaluation, Pentland said, comes when he and Sosa work in a batting cage for about 10 minutes each day. ''He'll talk about the game the day before, what he did, how he could have done better,'' Pentland said. ''His breakdowns are right on the mark.''</p>
        <p>Gonzalez also works daily on achieving his goal of staying healthy and playing every game.</p>
        <p>''He's in great shape,'' Melvin said. ''The workouts he goes through are amazing. When the team is at home, he works out every morning at the park at 11:30, then goes home and rests. He comes back to the park later. On the road, he's always in the health club. His work habits are great.''</p>
        <p>The injuries that have undermined Gonzalez's seasons are not always avoidable through hard work. Last year, for example, he tore a thumb ligament diving for a ball in a winter league playoff game and missed the first 24 games of the Rangers' season. But every time he drives in a run this season, he reminds everyone what a healthy Gonzalez can do.</p>
        <p>In driving in 96, he had nearly lapped the field. The next highest total in the American League was Ken Griffey Jr.'s 70. Even McGwire, the National League leader, was 10 behind. But before those making projections say Gonzalez is on a pace for a record-breaking 195, it should be recalled that Hack Wilson, en route to his total of 190 in 1930, drove in 53 runs in the Cubs' 30 games in August.</p>
        <p>''The one thing that's helped Juan with r.b.i.'s is having them as a goal instead of home runs,'' Melvin said. ''He doesn't go up trying to hit home runs. Once he got off to a great start with r.b.i.'s and there was that focus, he became a better hitter.''</p>
        <p>The general manager cited two recent examples of the kind of hitter Gonzalez has become.</p>
        <p>In a 7-7 game with Colorado, the Rangers had a runner at third base in the ninth inning, and Gonzalez had two strikes. ''The pitch was inside, and everybody was thinking he was going to try to hit the ball over the fence,'' Melvin said. ''But he inside-outed it to right-center for a single.''</p>
        <p>Against Anaheim, the Rangers had the bases loaded with two out and again two strikes on Gonzalez, and he drove an outside pitch into the right-center gap. ''If he was chasing the home run title or trying to hit home runs,'' Melvin said, ''he might try to pull the outside pitch. He sees those are r.b.i.'s, and he gets r.b.i.'s by using the whole field.''</p>
        <p>He does it, too, by using the whole schedule.</p>
        <p>30 Days at a Time</p>
        <p>Much noise was made last week when Sammy Sosa hit his 19th home run in June, breaking the record for home runs in a month. So when did they start playing baseball by calendar months?</p>
        <p>In other words, there is nothing sacred about a period running from the first day of a month to the last. But if one wishes to use a 30-day period as a barometer for hot home run streaks, how about the 21 that Sosa hit from May 22 through June 20?</p>
        <p>No one in history, the Elias Sports Bureau determined, had ever hit that many home runs in any 30-day span. The previous high was 20. Ralph Kiner of Pittsburgh hit 20 in 1947, from Aug. 14 through Sept. 12, and Roger Maris of the Yankees duplicated the feat in his record-breaking year of 1961, from May 24 through June 22.</p>
        <p>''This is a much more powerful statement than home runs in a specific month,'' Steve Hirdt of Elias said.</p>
        <p>Even more powerfully, Sosa hit 21 home runs in a 28-day period, from May 25 through June 21. Those were the same 21 home runs he hit in 22 games, having missed three games during his productive 30- and 27-day periods.</p>
        <p>Building a Rivalry</p>
        <p>The Florida Marlins and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays are Florida's only major league teams, but they apparently do not fit the definition of a natural rivalry. At least their fans don't think so.</p>
        <p>They played two games in each team's park last week and drew the fewest fans of the nine four-game home-and-home series that were played as part of the interleague schedule. The games in St. Petersburg attracted 53,146; those in Miami drew 36,327. Vincent Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing partner, acknowledged that his team should have promoted the Tampa Bay games more aggressively.</p>
        <p>''Had we marketed it better in advance and communicated better, we would have had bigger crowds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Can the rivalry be built?</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Naimoli said, ''we can do a lot of things from a marketing standpoint, create a state championship trophy, something like that. Because of other priorities, we didn't do a real effective job this time. As time goes on, we'll do better.''</p>
        <p>The average attendance for each team's pair of games was below the average for other games this season. The only other teams that drew a smaller average than they had for their other games were Texas and Arizona, who also played each other.</p>
        <p>The largest four-game attendance was 206,123 for the Yankees and the Atlanta Braves. The Montreal Expos had 25,771 for their two games with their Canadian rival Toronto, but the average was higher than their previous average of 10,767.</p>
