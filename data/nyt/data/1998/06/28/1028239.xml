        <p>Republican Party in Washington State admits to spending $30,000 more than law allows on five state Senate races in 1996, and accepting more than $30,000 in improper contributions to its political action committees; party agrees to pay $5,000 fine and to reduce its aid to candidates in 1998 elections by $150,000 (S)</p>

        <p>Going into the 1996 fall election, Republicans in Washington State, already in control of the State House of Representatives, figured they had a good shot at also taking over the 49-seat State Senate, then in Democratic control by only one seat. But it would take money.</p>
        <p>So the G.O.P. poured in the cash. It hired consultants, set up political action committees and provided major backing to the Republican candidates who looked in the best positions to defeat Democrats running for the State Senate.</p>

        <p>Going into the 1996 fall election, Republicans in Washington State, already in control of the State House of Representatives, figured they had a good shot at also taking over the 49-seat State Senate, then in Democratic control by only one seat. But it would take money.</p>
        <p>So the G.O.P. poured in the cash. It hired consultants, set up political action committees and provided major backing to the Republican candidates who looked in the best positions to defeat Democrats running for the State Senate.</p>
        <p>The plan worked. The Republican Party came out of the election in control of the Senate, 26 to 23 seats.</p>
        <p>Now, almost two years later, it turns out that some of the Republican spending was in serious violation of the state's campaign finance regulations.</p>
        <p>After an investigation by the Public Disclosure Commission, the bipartisan panel that monitors elections in Washington State, the party has conceded that it spent about $30,000 more than the law allowed on five Senate races, that it accepted more than $30,000 in improper contributions to its political action committees and that it improperly dipped into a restricted fund for about $150,000 to pay for polls and political consultants.</p>
        <p>As reparation, the party has agreed to pay a $5,000 fine and to reduce its aid to candidates in the 1998 elections by about $150,000.</p>
        <p>The Public Disclosure Commission also found that the party ''apparently'' violated state campaign law in 1996 by taking $150,000 from a restricted fund to finance a television advertisement attacking Gary Locke, the Democratic candidate for governor who went on to win. That finding, which the G.O.P. disputes, has been forwarded to the State Attorney General for possible action.</p>
        <p>Democrats, while pleased with the commission's findings, are incensed that it imposed a fine of only $5,000.</p>
        <p>''We're looking into the possibility of going to court,'' Paul Berendt, the Democratic state chairman, said on Friday.</p>
        <p>Would his party also try to have the 1996 elections results thrown out, given that they cost Democrats control of the Senate?</p>
        <p>''Too late for that,'' Mr. Berendt said. ''But the next election is just a few months away, and we've got high hopes for a comeback.''</p>
