        <p>As a man of the theater for more than 50 years, the eminent director Peter Brook has known and worked with a wide variety of famous artists. Here are his observations on several, excerpted from his memoir, ''Threads of Time: Recollections,'' published this month by Counterpoint.</p>
        <p>SALVADOR DALI:  When he described his ideas of making scenery out of firemen's hoses that, when the water was turned on, would swell, leap and twist into fantastic shapes, or of a proscenium constructed out of porcelain plates that would suddenly splinter and crash to the ground, or of dancers in a ballet he had designed who scattered hundreds of furled black umbrellas on the stage to make a lake so that when the hero, Ludwig of Bavaria, drowned himself, the great black lake of umbrellas would rise and snap open, making a funeral pall over his body, I was convinced that he could be the greatest inventor of stage effects and machinery since the baroque masques.</p>

        <p>As a man of the theater for more than 50 years, the eminent director Peter Brook has known and worked with a wide variety of famous artists. Here are his observations on several, excerpted from his memoir, ''Threads of Time: Recollections,'' published this month by Counterpoint.</p>
        <p>SALVADOR DALI:  When he described his ideas of making scenery out of firemen's hoses that, when the water was turned on, would swell, leap and twist into fantastic shapes, or of a proscenium constructed out of porcelain plates that would suddenly splinter and crash to the ground, or of dancers in a ballet he had designed who scattered hundreds of furled black umbrellas on the stage to make a lake so that when the hero, Ludwig of Bavaria, drowned himself, the great black lake of umbrellas would rise and snap open, making a funeral pall over his body, I was convinced that he could be the greatest inventor of stage effects and machinery since the baroque masques.</p>
        <p>He invited me to stay with him in his home in Cadaques [in Spain], and there he proved to be both a thoughtful host and an admirably serious collaborator. To be with the great surrealist and find no trace of eccentricity in his behavior was oddly disappointing nonetheless, until the morning I found him with two flowers in his nostrils. He raised a finger: ''We have guests.''</p>
        <p>BERTOLT BRECHT:  In 1951, Germany was still a dead sea of destruction whose waves were rubble out of which rose a feverish life that infected me with its excitements. This was my first trip to Berlin, and here I met Brecht.</p>
        <p>What fascinated me had nothing to do with his theories -- in the pragmatic climate of English theater I never read books about the stage -- it was the man, it was the melodrama of having to meet Brecht in secret, of not being allowed by the British military authorities to be seen speaking to this notorious Communist in public when he came to the first night of the ''Measure for Measure'' I had just staged in Stratford. There was some incomprehensible fear that a handshake could be interpreted politically by the West German press and embarrass whatever Allied policy was at the time.</p>
        <p>So I sat with this cool ironic man and his walnut-wrinkled wife, Helene Weigel, in a private dining room in a Berlin hotel, whose special entrance gave onto a back alley, eating a lavish meal laid on apologetically by the same military authorities at the army's expense, and it was this atmosphere of a spy movie that I relished rather than what he said.</p>
        <p>Brecht described to me his theory of ''alienation.'' He spoke of his ideal audience: two peasants sitting side by side in the front row discussing the action with irony, never caught up in the make-believe. He was articulate and entertaining, but I was quite unconvinced. For me, the stage was still the world of illusion I had cherished from childhood.</p>
        <p>JEANNE MOREAU:  She was late for the first rehearsal [of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'']. She was already something of a star and as I was discovering how 19th-century habits still prevailed in the French theater with leading ladies, I resolved to institute a climate of firm discipline from the beginning.</p>
        <p>The rest of the cast was assembled on the bare stage of the Theatre Antoine, and as I sat on the side, my watch in hand, a silence fell. No one moved, the tension grew. Ten minutes went by -- no sign of Jeanne. I waited, watched uneasily by the others.</p>
        <p>After 15 minutes, she made a splendid entrance, unconcerned, chattering excitedly, kissing those nearest the door. Then she noticed me, and as she began to run across the stage holding out her arms, I spoke icily: ''If you play the leading part, you need far more rehearsals than the others, not less. If you are late, you will be the loser.'' She stopped short as though she had been slapped, apologized profusely to the other actors and to me in such a spontaneous and modest way that the atmosphere was lightened, and we set to work.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, the old administrator of the theater, with the air of one who has seen everything in his time, took me by the arm. ''Ah, you the English! You and punctuality. You are terrible.''</p>
        <p>''Why?'' I protested. ''Do you think I went too far?''</p>
        <p>He shrugged. ''For 30 seconds . . .''</p>
        <p>''For 30 seconds?'' I repeated in astonishment.</p>
        <p>We compared watches. I was exactly 14 1/2 minutes fast.</p>
        <p>We never told the truth to Jeanne, and I think that the whole company left with a healthy respect for implacable British ways. After all, there is nothing the law-resenting French appreciate more than severity and rigor.</p>
        <p>JOHN GIELGUD:  What are these different levels, clumsily called ''better'' and ''worse,'' that give meaning to our work? What is the passage that leads from one to the other? In ''Measure for Measure'' at Stratford, then in London with ''The Winter's Tale'' and again with ''Venice Preserved,'' I was able to enter a unique and inventive mind always open to change.</p>
        <p>John had become notorious for never knowing what he wanted, but this was quite untrue. I felt very close to him and would easily follow his restless hesitations, as he had only one reference: an intuitive sense of quality. Everything he questioned and discarded related to an impossibly exacting standard that he could never reach.</p>
        <p>This indecision is far from the confusion that comes from weakness, for when John directed a company, the rejection of the mediocre, the constant demand to go further, to do better, the awareness of every detail, always led to an impressive unity.</p>
        <p>Something very precise was taking place through which the ''quality'' was being transformed. A mystery certainly, but also a process. Where could one find the key?</p>
