        <p>Six months after it retreated from closing weak banks or allowing them to fail, the Japanese Government is once again inclined to administer such shock therapy as a cure for the nation's sick financial system.</p>
        <p>Although no bank failures are expected before elections for the upper house of Parliament in July, comments from leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party suggest that they would not rescue financial institutions, some large, that are verging on insolvency.</p>
        <p>Investors are betting against the survival of at least two of Japan's weakest banks among the top 20 in the country, the Nippon Credit Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.</p>
        <p>Lenders and stockholders are abandoning them and other weak institutions. Nippon Credit shares traded here today at 121 yen, down 4 percent so far this week. The Long-Term Credit Bank's stock closed at 176 yen, down 8 percent in the same brief time.</p>
        <p>Analysts have resumed handicapping merger possibilities they envisioned last fall, when a string of failures shook the financial system. Those merger possibilities were dropped when Government bureaucrats insisted that no further fallout was evident.</p>
        <p>''There seems to be a greater possibility than before that the Government would consider shutting down some banks,'' said James P. Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Baring Securities of Japan.</p>
        <p>A week ago, Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior Liberal Democratic Party leader whose outspoken criticism of Government's efforts to fix the financial system have been a source of irritation, said Japan needed only half the number of banks it now has. ''Japanese banks can't survive with the current number,'' he told reporters.</p>
        <p>And Koichi Kato, the party's General Secretary and a longtime critic of the Finance Ministry, which oversees the banking system, said last month in Washington that more bank closings ''could well be expected.''</p>
        <p>Japan's banks are struggling with an estimated $600 billion in bad debt, a legacy of the speculative ''bubble economy'' of the 1980's. Last month, some of the largest banks reported their biggest annual losses ever.</p>
        <p>Last fall, the banking system seemed poised for a major overhaul when a number of overly indebted institutions collapsed. Sanyo Securities closed in November, quickly followed by the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Yamaichi Securities and a smaller regional bank.</p>
        <p>Investors expected more, but the torrid pace seemed to unsettle Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who spent much of December insisting that no more banks would fail.</p>
        <p>But market wisdom has held just as stubbornly that just as there is overcapacity in the global auto business that only consolidation will repair, there are too many Japanese financial institutions.</p>
        <p>That sentiment has hung over the Japanese economy and stock market, despite a 30 trillion yen rescue package for the financial system as well as several economic-stimulus packages.</p>
        <p>With few options left, politicians now seem more resigned to further financial institution failures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiorillo and other analysts decline to identify which banks they considered candidates for closing.</p>
        <p>Last fall, the Government made life difficult for the firms that employ analysts who spoke their minds about specific banks, accusing them of spreading rumors to support short-sellers, or investors who bet on stock declines. Right-wing extremists threatened the lives of two banking analysts who made the names public.</p>
        <p>Nippon Credit's problems have been grist for the rumor mill for more than a year. The Government arranged for a bailout for the bank last summer, pressing insurance companies and other banks to recapitalize it by buying preferred shares and issuing subordinated debt, which carries a higher risk of nonpayment than other types of debt.</p>
        <p>Nippon Credit now wants to extend the terms on some of those loans because it will have trouble meeting its obligations. Lenders are balking.</p>
        <p>One of those, the Nippon Life Insurance Company, sent a clear signal of its sentiments about the banking system when it announced over the weekend that it would no longer make subordinated loans to financial institutions because it considered them too great a credit risk. The Finance Ministry has said it will not protect shareholders or subordinated-debt holders.</p>
        <p>The Long-Term Credit Bank's shares have been pummeled, as rumors circulated that its investment banking alliance with the Swiss Bank Corporation was unraveling. Both it and Swiss Bank deny that their relationship is dissolving, but Swiss Bank has also made clear that it feels no obligation to rescue its partner, should it need help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiorillo calls Long-Term Credit the ''hardest call'' he has. He said the bank was not in as precarious a position as Nippon Credit because it had no immediate need for additional funds.</p>
        <p>Moody's Investors Service currently gives 10 Japanese financial institutions its worst rating for financial strength, including Long-Term Credit, Sakura Bank and Daiwa Bank.</p>
        <p>Daiwa is widely regarded as a potential acquisition target for a foreign bank. Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank are often discussed as candidates for potential mergers or takeovers.</p>
        <p>And banks are expected to take advantage of changes in the holding-company law to consolidate. Sanwa Bank, for instance, could absorb Toyo Trust and Banking, or Fuji Bank could take in the ever-ailing Yasuda Trust.</p>
