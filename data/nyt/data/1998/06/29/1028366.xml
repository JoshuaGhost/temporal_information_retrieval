        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I don't think computer science research will suffer because the industry is booming (front page, June 25). I am a graduate student in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; a vast majority of industry jobs would not have long-term appeal to someone with research inclinations. A researcher is a free spirit. If your mind is busy with technical details, you do not get to think creatively about anything other than, say, Web page design.</p>

        <p>I don't think computer science research will suffer because the industry is booming (front page, June 25). I am a graduate student in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; a vast majority of industry jobs would not have long-term appeal to someone with research inclinations. A researcher is a free spirit. If your mind is busy with technical details, you do not get to think creatively about anything other than, say, Web page design.</p>
        <p>Look at mathematics, physics, chemistry or biology: aren't there armies of researchers who have given up a chance to make money somewhere? Isn't it true these sciences are making wonderful progress every day? Yet they have small Ph.D. programs. Computer science's chance of advancing is no worse and maybe better: it has more people, money and industry-driven motivation.</p>
