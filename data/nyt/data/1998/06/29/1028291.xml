        <p>By a few minutes before midnight, a line outside CompUSA's flagship store in this Dallas suburb stretched past the training center entrance next door, the GNC nutrition store, the Subway sandwich shop, the Packaging Store, the Elegant Salon, the Converse Shoe Factory and Pam's Hallmark store.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft Corporation had muted its mighty hype machine for the release of Windows 98. But CompUSA, having just agreed to pay $275 million to buy its chief rival, Computer City, from the Tandy Corporation, was out to prove that the computer retail store was not about to go the way of the ice house.</p>
        <p>Its radio and newspaper advertisements offered the first 10 people in line a 266 megahertz computer for $98, and there were special deals on modems, hard drives and so forth for those farther back in a queue that began forming at 9 A.M.</p>
        <p>But how many in that line would buy a computer from CompUSA at regular prices?</p>
        <p>Among the first 10 in line were Frank Callahan, a retired regional sales manager for Raleigh Bicycles, and his wife, Janet. Two years ago, when they bought their last computer, they came to CompUSA to comparison shop. But they ordered their machine from IMS Computers, a local assembler.</p>
        <p>''We could get what we wanted built by IMS much cheaper,'' Mrs. Callahan said.</p>
        <p>CompUSA's Packard Bell, Compaq and Acer models offered less value and flexibility. ''Here, we had to take what was in the package,'' Mr. Callahan said.</p>
        <p>Against competition from no-name direct marketers and shops like IMS and big-name direct marketers like the Dell Computer Corporation, CompUSA's challenge is to keep the computer store alive even as it diversifies into corporate sales and services.</p>
        <p>To attract customers like the Callahans, CompUSA again began offering built-to-order computers last September under its own brand name. Because the chain's previous effort to build its own computers flopped a few years ago, this time it tried to avoid accumulating a parts inventory -- whose value drops, on average, 2 percent a week -- by having contractors build the machines. But since the contractors have not been able to keep up with demand, the company says it will again start building computers.</p>
        <p>CompUSA's chief executive, James F. Halpin, a blunt, brusque 400-megahertz type of guy in an industry where last year's business model is usually as outdated as last year's computer, came in and saved the company in 1994 when it was on the brink of collapse.</p>
        <p>But the industry has become even more competitive in the last four years. Falling computer prices, strong competition and diversification costs caused CompUSA's first-quarter profits to fall 22 percent compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, to $25.4 million.</p>
        <p>Sales rose 14 percent, to $1.45 billion, but for the 122 stores that have been open a year or more, they rose just 1.2 percent.</p>
        <p>As computer buyers become more informed and confident, direct marketers like Dell and Gateway 2000 are growing faster than computer superstores like CompUSA.</p>
        <p>Mr. Halpin concedes that Dell and other companies that take orders on line or over the phone offer more megahertz for the money. ''Our major vendors haven't been able to give us machines that compete,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While superstores as a category sold 3.1 million computers last year -- an increase of almost a million in two years -- direct sales rose by than 2 million, to 5.5 million units.</p>
        <p>Direct markets are gaining a further advantage as more customers shop on the Internet. Dell, which had sales of just $1 million a day on its World Wide Web site in March 1997, was up to $3 million a day by Christmas and is now billing $5 million a day on line -- more than 13 percent of its total sales.</p>
        <p>CompUSA also recently began selling over the Internet, but the popularity of computers selling for less than $1,000, at slim profit margins, is squeezing revenues. Dataquest, a market research company in San Jose, Calif., expects computer sales to rise 16 percent, to 35.2 million units, this year, while revenues rise only 3 percent, to $69.5 billion. The average price will fall to $1,974 this year from $2,223 last year, Dataquest predicts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Halpin portrays lower prices as an advantage because they expand the market. Over the last two years, he said, the average family income of computer buyers has fallen from $75,000 to less than $50,000. ''Computers have become affordable to the middle class,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Most analysts called the Computer City acquisition a bargain, pointing out that it eliminated a chief rival and afforded CompUSA inexpensive expansion.</p>
        <p>Mark Harrington, editor of Computer Retail Week, sees the Computer City acquisition raising CompUSA's profit margins, but wonders if the company is trying to do too many things at once.</p>
        <p>''They haven't fully integrated all the businesses they've started,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''A bleeding Computer City on its back is really going to test the company to the limit.''</p>
        <p>Though CompUSA announced that it would close some Computer City stores, keeping the remainder open with qualified salespeople could be a challenge. At one nearby Computer City store, salespeople said that under Tandy, commissions had often doubled or tripled their daily earnings. If CompUSA pays them like it pays its own salespeople, who work without commissions, ''We're going to leave,'' said one Computer City salesperson as others nodded.</p>
        <p>But in a field littered with wounded rivals -- Computer City has been a steady money loser -- CompUSA and Mr. Halpin still appear to have the best shot at revising the formula.</p>
        <p>Just after midnight last Thursday, Mr. Halpin was seen surveying the 600 or so customers storming through the doors of his San Francisco store. ''I'm pumped!'' he was heard bellowing. ''It's like election night. The votes are coming in.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft has positioned Windows 98 as a minor upgrade, but Mr. Halpin describes it as a spark for the whole computer industry.</p>
        <p>''I installed it on my daughter's computer at home,'' he recounted. ''I asked her how she liked it. 'Awesome,' she said.''</p>
        <p>Just in case shoppers are less impressed, CompUSA is moving beyond brick-and-mortar stores. ''We sell computers any way a customer wants to buy them,'' Mr. Halpin said. ''We can deliver and install from one PC up to 2,000. We want to train you. We want to service you.''</p>
        <p>The Addison store's back offices include a sales operation where each workday 28 salespeople ring up businesses and corporations.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, challenges grow in the consumer end of the business. Despite a towering kiosk trumpeting CompUSA's built-to-order computers, few of the customers who showed up at the Addison store on Thursday seemed aware of this option. With its own label, the company says it can beat even Dell's prices on such systems -- a contention Dell disputes -- but it will have to convince the many current CompUSA customers who say they visit the stores mostly to see what's new, maybe buy some cables or software before heading elsewhere to buy a computer.</p>
        <p>What is more, many shoppers are increasingly able to outsmart the best marketing schemes.</p>
        <p>As Lisa Adams and Howard J. Huang, Dallas medical students, stood in a checkout line, they described what seemed like an offer of free -- or better than free -- computer memory modules: 16 megabytes  of memory for $38 with a $40 mail-in rebate, but with only one rebate per customer. They explained, however, that the memory could only be installed in pairs. One rebate on two memory chips made the price higher than that charged by other marketers on the Internet, they said.</p>
        <p>''They're counting on you to buy the other one,'' Mr. Huang said. ''Smart marketing trick.''</p>
        <p>But not smart enough. Mr. Huang and Ms. Adams were each buying one 16-megabyte module and pooling their rebates. They got 32 megabits of free memory for Ms. Adams's computer -- truly free.</p>
