        <p>An Oklahoma Congressman won preliminary support last week for legislation that would require public schools and libraries to use filters on their computers as a way to keep children from seeing sexually explicit material on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The proposal by Representative Ernest Istook Jr., a Republican, was added to an $81.9 billion budget bill pending in the House Appropriations Committee to cover education, labor and health and human services. The bill is expected to be sent to the full House after lawmakers return from the July 4 recess.</p>
        <p>Since the Communications Decency Act was overturned by the Supreme Court last year, lawmakers have sought more narrowly tailored legislation to shield children without violating the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>''The appropriations bill is a must-pass bill, so it is very dangerous that the provision has been added to that bill,'' said Ron Weich, a legislative consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully challenged the Communications Decency Act.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Istook said the amendment stirred no controversy among members of the subcommittee that approved it. ''There was no opposition,'' the aide said. ''It was a 14-0 vote.''</p>
        <p>A similar bill, sponsored by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, has passed the Senate Commerce Committee. But it is narrower, applying only to schools and libraries that receive Federal financial assistance in obtaining Internet access.</p>
