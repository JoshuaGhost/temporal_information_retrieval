      <abstract>
        <p>Elizabeth Kolbert Metro Matters column on philosophical difference that fuels budget battles between Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and New York City Council; Giuliani expects public institutions to pull their own weight; his attempt to include public libraries in this concept, by cutting their city funds, met with stiff opposition from City Council, which ultimately overrode Mayor's vetoes and restored funds for libraries; whether shabbier branches of library will get much-needed repairs is still in question (M)</p>

        <p>IT is just after 3 o'clock on a recent afternoon and the Hamilton Fish Park branch library on the Lower East Side is beginning to fill with children. First come the older ones, who stride in purposefully, with knapsacks full of homework. Then come the very young ones, who have clearly been sent to the library because it is safer than sending them home to an empty apartment.</p>
        <p>The library does seem safe -- there is a guard posted by the door -- and before the children arrive, at least, the books and chairs are in order. But it is hard to ignore the general shabbiness. Paint is peeling and the tables are beaten up. The public bathrooms are under repair, blocked off by sheets of plastic.</p>

        <p>IT is just after 3 o'clock on a recent afternoon and the Hamilton Fish Park branch library on the Lower East Side is beginning to fill with children. First come the older ones, who stride in purposefully, with knapsacks full of homework. Then come the very young ones, who have clearly been sent to the library because it is safer than sending them home to an empty apartment.</p>
        <p>The library does seem safe -- there is a guard posted by the door -- and before the children arrive, at least, the books and chairs are in order. But it is hard to ignore the general shabbiness. Paint is peeling and the tables are beaten up. The public bathrooms are under repair, blocked off by sheets of plastic.</p>
        <p>Asked when he expects the repairs to be completed, one librarian answers sardonically, ''We don't.''</p>
        <p>The next day, also at roughly 3 o'clock, well-heeled visitors are streaming into the Museum of Modern Art. In the sculpture garden, there are German tourists drinking $2.50 espressos, while in the gift shop, there is a long line at the cash register, and in front of Picasso's ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' so many fascinated -- or at least footsore -- fans have gathered that there is no more room on the bench.</p>
        <p>The museum's wealth is everywhere apparent, indeed virtually on display. On the second floor, just before you reach Monet's waterlilies is a model for a planned expansion, which would, according to the accompanying description, ''radically reinvent'' the way the Modern presents its collection. Its price tag: $650 million.</p>
        <p>IN their ugly budget battle, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, haven't made much secret of their heartfelt desire to humiliate each other. When you cut not just the City Council's ''member items,'' but also its own operating budget, as the Mayor recently tried to do, it is clear that the personal really is the political.</p>
        <p>Mixed up in all this wonderfully spiteful and vindictive squabbling, there is something like a philosophical difference. In their wrangling, the Council and the Mayor are consistently at odds over the basic question of what private institutions should expect from the public and vice versa.</p>
        <p>After almost five years in office, Mr. Giuliani has made it abundantly clear that he expects public institutions to start pulling their own weight, and he has encouraged them to seek out private money to perform basic services like street cleaning and park maintenance. This year, he proposed expanding this concept to the public libraries, cutting funds they had expected to use to buy books and pay librarians and urging them to raise it back from private sources.</p>
        <p>''I think public-private partnerships have been a very valuable resource for making institutions more independent,'' he said, defending his proposed cuts to libraries like the Hamilton Fish branch.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Mayor has been unusually generous to some of the city's most glamorous private enterprises, from rich Wall Street firms to the even richer New York Yankees. Just as he was cutting about $15 million from the city's libraries, he was offering about $65 million to help the Modern finance its ambitious expansion.</p>
        <p>Against the Mayor's boundary-blurring style, the members of the City Council have -- out of principle, political calculation or sheer inertia -- defended the old pattern. When they got the Mayor's budget, they promptly cut the money for the Modern and restored funds for the libraries. They have also very vocally opposed the Mayor's plans to finance a new Yankee Stadium, and spoken up for such mundane services as garbage collection and recycling.</p>
        <p>As the battle stands now, the City Council -- somewhat improbably -- seems to be winning. When the Mayor came back with his recent vetoes, he left in the $15 million the Council had added back for the libraries. But he could not on his own put back money for the Modern.</p>
        <p>When the Council overrode his vetoes, it put back yet another $7 million for the libraries and nothing for the Modern.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether the Masters of the Universe who serve on the museum's board can somehow bend the Council to their will. But that the Modern's expansion will, in any case, move forward is probably a safe bet.</p>
        <p>As to whether the bathroom in the Hamilton Fish library will be working again any time soon, that's another matter.</p>
