        <p>DONNOLO - Domenica. ''Dimi'' (nee Leuzzi). Dimi was born on June 9, 1919 and died June 20, 1998 after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Beloved wife of the late Vincent. She is survived by her sister Immaculate Mandragona, four daughters: Suzanne, Christine, Claire and Felicia Shuff and her husband Marc: and two sons Philip and Daniel and his wife Candace. Her four grandsons: Michael and Joshua Donnolo and Ian and Adam Shuff were her special love and brought much joy to her life and were a special comfort to her illness. She was a graduate of Pratt Institute and a loyal volunteer at the Metropolitan Opera Guild Education Office. Her friends will remember her countless performances in musicals at St. Ephrem's Players Guild, the Ridge Chorale and with The Jeff Samaha Singers. For years she had a one woman musical revue and sang for seniors in nursing homes throughout Brooklyn. She was an artist and took great pleasure in painting the flower of remembrance-the pansy. We will miss her every day for the rest of our lives but will cherish our memories of a mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend of selfless, abounding love and devotion. Reposing at Ralph Aievoli &amp; Son, Inc., 1275 65 Street, Brooklyn, New York. Visiting hours Sunday, 7-9:30 PM, Monday and Tuesday 2-4:30 and 7-9:30 PM. Funeral Mass Wednesday St. Ephrem R.C. Church, 9:30 AM. In lieu of flowers donations in Domenica's name to BRAVO or the Brooklyn Hospice.</p>
