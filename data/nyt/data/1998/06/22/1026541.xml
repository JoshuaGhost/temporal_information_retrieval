        <p>Sarah McLachlan does not want the Lilith Fair, the summerlong ''celebration of women in music'' that began its second year today at the Civic Auditorium here, to be judged as a political intervention. Ms. McLachlan, the Canadian singer-songwriter and Lilith founder, has said she wanted concertgoers to appreciate the artistry of this touring bill of female artists, and to leave questions of its social impact for the history books.</p>
        <p>Judging Lilith Fair on esthetic terms, however, demands exploring what unites its participants beyond gender. Such collective interests turn the best summer festivals into events rather than just painfully long concerts. Consider Lilith as if it were a bluegrass fest, then, or a day of Dixieland jazz: a gathering devoted to an esoteric musical style. At Lilith, feminine folk-pop is the chosen arcana.</p>

        <p>Sarah McLachlan does not want the Lilith Fair, the summerlong ''celebration of women in music'' that began its second year today at the Civic Auditorium here, to be judged as a political intervention. Ms. McLachlan, the Canadian singer-songwriter and Lilith founder, has said she wanted concertgoers to appreciate the artistry of this touring bill of female artists, and to leave questions of its social impact for the history books.</p>
        <p>Judging Lilith Fair on esthetic terms, however, demands exploring what unites its participants beyond gender. Such collective interests turn the best summer festivals into events rather than just painfully long concerts. Consider Lilith as if it were a bluegrass fest, then, or a day of Dixieland jazz: a gathering devoted to an esoteric musical style. At Lilith, feminine folk-pop is the chosen arcana.</p>
        <p>Viewing Lilith this way derails the questions that critics have raised about its lack of diversity. (The tour goes out on its farthest limb later in its schedule, when the hip-hop stylist Missy Elliott joins in for some dates.) It finds strengths in the resemblances among the five acts that shared the concert's main stage on Friday.</p>
        <p>These artists -- Ms. McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, the Indigo Girls, Erykah Badu and Sinead O'Connor -- are masters of the brand of tuneful, literary pop that explores woman-centered myths and realities. Appearing with their own bands here, each claimed a stake within this rich, if sometimes overly sweetened, style.</p>
        <p>Feminine folk-pop offers specific emotional and musical pleasures. It blends confessional singer-songwriting with vague social idealism, finding common ground in women's personal experiences. Emphasizing the voice and the gentle give-and-take of ensemble playing, it ignores instrumental virtuosity and generally avoids the catharsis of rock. Sympathy is its ultimate value, as fans apply its messages about love and understanding to their own lives.</p>
        <p>Many artists working within this traditionally feminine mode are content to honor its ethos; the most interesting also reconfigure it. Each of Lilith's main-stage performers attempted this, with varying degrees of success. Inventiveness, though, is not necessarily the quality that endears them to most fans swaying and crooning to their favorite meaning-filled ballads. Thus, they lightly tread the territory connecting their individualism with the genre's equalizing demands.</p>
        <p>Sets on two smaller stages by up-and-coming artists, including the flamboyant Billie Myers and the moody Spanish group Lhasa, set the mood, but this year's emphasis is on the main stage. Ms. O'Connor appeared there first, offering a condensed version of her appearance at the Guinness Fleadh festival in New York City the week before. In good voice and a chipper mood, she made the most of a short set.</p>
        <p>Ms. Badu also abbreviated her usual show without abandoning her favorite themes. She broke the festival's most significant cultural barrier by preaching her Afrocentric philosophy via a smooth blend of hip-hop, jazz and soul, just as she does to her largely black audiences on her own tours. As she extolled motherhood and thanked the Creator for her talent, it was easy to comprehend the themes she shares with Ms. O'Connor. Both view femininity as a spiritually rich calling that has been tainted through abuse and seek to restore its luster within their soothing but powerful songs. Both also sing and write in ways that make their music as singular as their messages can be sweeping; and although neither did anything unusual on Friday, their presence gave depth to the festival.</p>
        <p>The Indigo Girls are impressive singers, too, but despite their conscious efforts to refresh folk-rock with new ingredients (a sampled trip-hop beat here, a heavy-metal riff there), they remain strongest within its most familiar parameters. The duo prompted many sing-alongs, balancing Amy Ray's deep-voiced, passionate declarations against Emily Saliers's more lightly phrased musings. Inviting Ms. McLachlan and K's Choice, one of the groups that performed on a smaller stage, to join them for the traditional folk song ''The Water Is Wide'' Neil Young's ''Rockin' in the Free World,'' the Indigo Girls invoked the bonding ritual of feminist women's music festivals, spicing it up with a dash of mainstream rock-and-roll.</p>
        <p>Diametrically opposed to the Indigo Girls' extroverted presence, Ms. Merchant tapped the enduring charm of the eccentric woman artist. In a multicolored outfit reminiscent of a Pottery Barn catalogue, spinning and curling herself into a ball, she guided her band through her sometimes cryptic songs in a performance that was all about her own joy in the music.</p>
        <p>She sang a campy version of ''If I Only Had a Brain,'' from ''The Wizard of Oz,'' and material from her older albums and the new ''Ophelia.'' But the individual selections mattered less than the buoyant mood she created by so gracefully dancing with her own muse.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the very lack of such a peculiar inner sprite is what has made Ms. McLachlan so popular; her gift is for playing an idealized emotional Everywoman, and she took that stance once again during her surprisingly short closing set. Revisiting hits and presenting a few new songs, she made the sophisticated pop that is her specialty intimate by mining the lustrous quality of her voice.</p>
        <p>Once in a while, she roughened up that instrument ever so slightly, abandoning her patented comforting tone. For now, though, she remained the quintessential feminine folk-popster, reigning at the easily reached center of a perilously softhearted art.  POP REVIEW</p>
