        <p>Signs developed today that the Senate's weeks-long impasse on anti-smoking legislation might be broken.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted, 52 to 46, for a Republican amendment to use some of the money that would be raised from higher cigarette prices on drug abuse programs. The vote was the first on the legislation in three weeks, and plans were made to vote on Wednesday on proposals to use other money from the tobacco legislation for income-tax cuts.</p>
        <p>No one involved was prepared to assert that the bill was out of the woods. But in a brief interview, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said, ''If we're going to start having some votes, then something might happen.''</p>
        <p>This was a different tack from the one Mr. Lott took on Monday, when he said the bill was such bad legislation that it should be withdrawn. Approval of the anti-drug measure, along with expected adoption of the  tax cuts, ''does change the mix,'' he said tonight.</p>
        <p>In a telephone conversation just before President Clinton's news conference this afternoon, Senator Lott told the President of the progress. When he was asked about the legislation, the President said:</p>
        <p>''I do believe that the possibility of getting a comprehensive bill out of the Senate is greater now than it was this morning. There are still problems, to be sure. But we are getting closer to, I think, a principled compromise.''</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain, the chief sponsor of the bill, agreed. ''Reports of the death of this legislation were premature,'' he said. But Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, quickly added that ''a lot of difficult hurdles'' remained before the bill could be brought to a final vote.</p>
        <p>The basic bill, meant to discourage teen-age smoking, would raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack over five years, expand Federal regulation of tobacco marketing and advertising, and require the cigarette makers to pay stiff penalties if youth smoking did not fall to specified levels.</p>
        <p>Most Democrats have argued that it is the most important public health measure to come before Congress in years. Republicans have countered that the legislation is a futile effort to deal with a public health problem by raising taxes and creating new Government programs.</p>
        <p>The measure to be considered on Wednesday would give tax breaks to couples filing joint returns and to self-employed workers who must pay for their own medical insurance. That and the anti-drug measure approved tonight give Republicans the opportunity to argue that they have turned the legislation into one that fits Republican principles.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders in the House are still unenthusiastic about the direction the legislation in the Senate is taking. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, told reporters today that his associates were working on a stripped-down bill that would not raise the price of cigarettes.</p>
        <p>The Congressional elections this fall are a motif that influences the entire debate. Democrats have made clear that if strong anti-smoking legislation does not pass, they will accuse Republicans of doing the bidding of the tobacco companies. But Democrats have been forced into supporting income-tax cuts to keep the Republicans themselves from having a strong campaign issue.</p>
        <p>The logjam in the Senate came unstuck today during a series of private meetings that followed an unsuccessful Democratic move to cut off debate on the legislation. The Democratic effort, called cloture, was rejected by 56 to 42 -- 18 votes shy of the 60 needed for approval.</p>
        <p>All the Republicans who voted, even such anti-smoking stalwarts as  John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Mr. McCain himself, opposed stopping the debate, treating the matter as a challenge to the Republican leadership. All the Democratic senators who voted were in favor of cloture except for two from tobacco states, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky and Charles S. Robb of Virginia.</p>
        <p>Both sides agreed that the cloture vote had caused senators to focus on the issue. Senator Lott said Democrats had become willing to compromise because ''they saw we wouldn't crack on cloture.''</p>
        <p>Democrats had a different explanation. They said Senator Lott's hand had been forced because he knew he could not keep Republicans who favor tobacco legislation in line on future votes to cut off debate. New cloture votes are set for Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
        <p>One of the most ardent opponents of the legislation, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said tonight that the changes being made might swing him around. ''This is a step in the right direction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Republican amendment approved tonight, on what was virtually a party-line vote, would spend part of the money raised from higher cigarette prices to beef up Federal efforts against drug trafficking and to give vouchers to children who are victims of drug-related crimes so they can attend private or parochial  schools. The amendment would also prohibit Federal money from being used for needle-exchange programs.</p>
        <p>After approving the Republican amendment, the Senate rejected, 53  to 45, a Democratic alternative that would also have put more money into drug interdiction programs. The Democratic proposal would not have included vouchers for schoolchildren, however, and would have limited the moratorium on needle exchanges to one year.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain said that beyond the drug and income-tax issues, only a few contentious topics remained. One involves the kind of assistance that would be given to tobacco farmers and to communities whose economy is dependent on tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing.</p>
