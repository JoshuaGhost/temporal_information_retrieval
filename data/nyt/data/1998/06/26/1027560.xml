        <p>The State Assembly passed a bill yesterday that would effectively raise the minimum age to 18 for obtaining full driving privileges.</p>
        <p>Under the bill, drivers under 18 would be required to hold a provisional license for one year after they passed a driving test, said Edward Rumen, a spokesman for Assemblyman Joseph Malone, a Republican of Bordentown, who co-sponsored the bill. The provisional license would forbid young motorists from driving unaccompanied between midnight and 5 A.M. unless the travel was for work or religious purposes, Mr. Rumen said. They would also be limited to one passenger, except for a driving instructor or family members. The bill now goes to the Senate.</p>
