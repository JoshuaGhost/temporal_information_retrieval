        <p>The President led a schoolyard discussion today in Xiahe, about 30 miles east of Xian and adjacent to the famed archeological site of the terra-cotta warriors buried in the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang.</p>
        <p>The President heard from a carefully selected group of citizens of Xiahe and nearby towns: a schoolteacher, a clinic worker, a restaurant owner and the manager of a factory that produces souvenir replicas of the terra cotta warriors.</p>
        <p>The President listened intently, asking whether Government policies had led to growing prosperity in the village, educational levels and the challenges of running a small business in the booming economy.</p>
        <p>Xiahe is a village of 400 people. One man told the President that his family's annual income had exploded to 30,000 yuan from 1,000 yuan before 1982.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also took questions. A restaurant owner asked him why he was holding such a discussion.</p>
        <p>''For two reasons,'' the President answered. ''First of all, I think it's important for people in positions like mine, in the United States and China, understand how people live at what we call the grass-roots level and understand how the policies we make affect the way people live and the lives of ordinary citizens.''</p>
        <p>He continued, ''And secondly, because the American people are very interested in learning more about the Chinese people as a result of my trip. So when we do this there will be pictures and reports of this meeting in America so people just like you in America will have a feeling for what it's like to be a teacher or run a restaurant or work with old people.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Taiwan, Mr. Clinton said, ''It's obvious there will be no change in our position one way or the other on this trip.''</p>
        <p>Next on the itinerary for the Clintons is a tour of Emperor Qin's tomb.</p>
