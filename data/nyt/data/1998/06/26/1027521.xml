        <p>An article on Tuesday about Representative Charles E. Schumer's Senate candidacy referred imprecisely to a record set by his fund-raising. Mr. Schumer has raised more from contributors than any other challenger in Congressional history this early in a campaign, not for an entire campaign.</p>
        <p>A chart with the article depicted Mr. Schumer's 1997 fund-raising incorrectly. His treasury received nearly $9 million last year, but $5.3 million of it was raised in earlier campaigns and transferred into his account.</p>
