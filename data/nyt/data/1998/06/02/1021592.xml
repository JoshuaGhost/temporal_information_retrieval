        <p>Jack Nicklaus has designed golf courses in the desert, on tropical islands and in remote wooded areas. But building a golf course on a Bronx garbage heap should rank as one of his most creative projects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicklaus's company has released only a preliminary sketch of a design for the course, to be built on 175 marshy and undeveloped acres in Ferry Point Park. It is hard to predict what sort of course golfers should expect, because Mr. Nicklaus prides himself on variety, and the characteristics and terrain of a site go a long way toward determining what kind of course he creates.</p>
        <p>But there is certainly reason to be optimistic about the quality of the layout. The list of courses that Mr. Nicklaus has designed, either as the project chief or as a consultant, is impressive. Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, the sight of the Memorial Tournament that was won by Fred Couples on Sunday, is regarded as one of the world's finest courses.</p>
        <p>While Muirfield may be Nicklaus's best work, his other acclaimed courses include Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario; Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Miss.; Castle Pines Golf Club in Castle Rock, Colo., and Grand Cypress in Orlando. All of these have hosted PGA Tour or Senior Tour events.</p>
        <p>In his book ''Jack Nicklaus, My Story,'' Mr. Nicklaus laid out some general guidelines for what he called a ''well-balanced golf course.'' For example, he said, a course should have one long par-5 hole, where even the best players would have trouble reaching the green in two shots, one ''definitely reachable'' par-5 hole, and two others par 5's that would be reachable depending upon weather conditions.</p>
        <p>He said he sought similar variety in the par-3 holes, and added, ''Ideally, they should go in different directions to vary the wind factor.'' He also noted that he liked to include water hazards on about a third of the holes.</p>
        <p>''The thing I take the greatest pride in as a designer is honesty; not tricking up holes, trying to keep everything out in the open,'' Mr. Nicklaus wrote. ''I don't want to play with the golfer's mind, just make him or her use it fully.''</p>
