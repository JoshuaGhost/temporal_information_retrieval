        <p>Chiding Japan for not addressing its economic problems more adroitly and voicing strong support for the International Monetary Fund, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers warned today that problems in Russia and China had the potential to spread elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In a speech to banking executives at the International Monetary Conference here, Mr. Summers said the health and direction of the Japanese economy were important in the recovery of Southeast Asia and scolded Japan and its banks for not acting more boldly to help revive the nation's sagging fortunes.</p>
        <p>The Japanese economy has deteriorated in recent months, he said, particularly in the banking sector, with an estimated $600 billion to $1 trillion in bad loans on its books.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers lauded Japan's attempts to stimulate its economy, but asked the country and the banks to do more and to do it faster.</p>
        <p>''Going forward it will be important to insure that future fiscal policies are consistent with long-lasting domestic demand-led growth,'' Mr. Summers said. ''But it will also be vital to address in a more determined manner the financial sector.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers was at odds with Japanese bankers, who said sufficient steps had been taken to resolve the problems.</p>
        <p>''There is too much pessimism about the international competitiveness of Japanese banks,'' said the chairman of Fuji Bank Ltd., Toru Hashimoto. ''Many major banks have taken bold steps to improve their financial health by writing off, directly or indirectly, enormous amounts of nonperforming loans at the end of March this year. Profit levels are now expected to recover steadily, and I believe they will regain their competitiveness within the next three years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers said the I.M.F. was indispensable in helping resolve international financial instability. In particular, he said, Russia is under serious strain.</p>
        <p>''Russia's trouble, in turn, has the potential to become central Europe's and the world's,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Markets on the periphery of Russia have been buffeted as the ruble and the Russian stock market have recently fallen.</p>
        <p>In Poland the all-share Warsaw Stock Index fell 4.1 percent today, continuing a sharp drop that has been under way for weeks.</p>
        <p>In Tallinn, Estonia, the stock market fell 15.78 percent last week, echoing declines in the Baltics and Eastern and Central Europe.</p>
        <p>China's internal economic problems, as well as the plight of its neighbors in Asia, Mr. Summers said, have put pressure on the yuan.</p>
        <p>But it is crucial that China continue to act as a ''firebreak against the possibility of another cycle of competitive devaluation in Asia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers said that continued financing for the International Monetary Fund was crucial and that the White House would do everything in its power to make sure the agency's role as a lender of last resort was not undermined.</p>
        <p>''Not to support the I.M.F. at this point in time is like canceling one's life-insurance policy when one has already gotten sick,'' Mr. Summers said. ''It's not a risk we should take. And let me be clear. It's not a risk this administration plans to take.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers also advocated continued international support for emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.</p>
