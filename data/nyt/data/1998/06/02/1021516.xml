        <p>ALICE Saltzman sees her part-time job as a mission. By working with medical students, she hopes to make one of the most uncomfortable aspects of medicine a gentler, less intimidating process -- for both patient and doctor.</p>
        <p>A New York social worker turned actress, Ms. Saltzman, 36, and her colleagues around the country are playing an increasingly important role in medical education. Called genital teaching associates, or G.T.A.'s, they use their bodies as models to teach breast, pelvic and genital-urinary examination techniques to medical students, residents and even doctors.</p>
        <p>''When I was a social worker, I became very concerned about how women were treated,'' Ms. Saltzman said. When she learned about the associates through a colleague who was in the field, she became curious. ''I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do it. But now, I feel like I'm helping women all over the world. It's very empowering.'' Some days, she said, ''I come home feeling like I've done such a world of good.''</p>
        <p>Since their introduction in the 1970's, teaching associate programs have expanded to nearly half the nation's medical schools, if not more, said Gayle Gliva-McConvey, a pioneer in the programs and the director of the professional skills center at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. Such programs are reaching more and more students, in effect changing the way the intimate examinations are conducted, one fledgling doctor at a time.</p>
        <p>Now, in the era of managed care, the associate's role has become even more important, as health care companies closely guard their doctors' hours, said Ms. Gliva-McConvey. But the greater service is provided by helping to train more nurses, doctors and other practitioners to handle one of the most stressful parts of patient examinations -- and in fact to conduct genital examinations at all.</p>
        <p>Men and women are involved in associate programs, but the emphasis has always been on women.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty clear we were doing a pretty terrible job teaching medical students how to do pelvic exams,'' said Dr. Robert M. Kretzschmar, now in private practice in Iowa City, Iowa. Teaching was done at clinics on indigent patients by ''terrified medical students looking at female genitalia on a live person for the first time,'' Dr. Kretzschmar recalled from the early 1960's when he was an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa.</p>
        <p>A few years later, Dr. Kretzschmar sowed the seeds of the nation's ''standardized patient'' programs, using average people to pose as patients for medical students. He started teaching medical interviewing techniques to his students using the wives of fellow staff physicians at the University of Iowa.</p>
        <p>By the late 1960's, he had made the leap to the genital teaching associates, employing an aide from the urology department who had agreed to be a model for pelvic exams. She requested to be draped so she could remain anonymous. ''The person was being paid, and not exploited,'' he said, unlike the disadvantaged women at the clinic. ''It was a great improvement,'' he added. But it still was not what he wanted: ''I wanted to get rid of the drape. I wanted the patient to interact with the students.''</p>
        <p>At professional meetings throughout the 1970's, he explained his program and the idea took off, he said. One medical school hired prostitutes for its program. Others placed ads in local newspapers. Dr. Kretzschmar though, set about finding bright women who were good teachers and who wanted to contribute to medical education. He offered $25 an hour. ''These people could do a better job of teaching than I, because they were using their own anatomy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The genital teaching associate programs evolved with the standardized patient programs, which now exist in 83 of the nation's 126 medical schools, according to Ms. Gliva-McConvey, up from 69 programs in 1991-92. Exact figures are not available on the number of genital teaching associate programs, but anecdotal reports indicate a strong presence.</p>
        <p>At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, for example, both programs have grown significantly, said Mary Cantrell, who was an actress and a standardized patient before becoming director of the school's clinical skills center.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the school had one standardized patient. Today, it has more than 200, including 30 genital teaching associates. ''The impact it has on students and the amount of doctor time it saves is amazing,'' she said.  ''These medical students can end up doing a better exam than a practicing nurse or physician.''</p>
        <p>Despite the program's rapid growth, some physicians are skeptical of its value, she said. ''But because the G.T.A.'s are trained by doctors, doctors are setting the standard,'' she said, adding that diagnostic procedures still are taught by doctors.</p>
        <p>Even after years with the books and the lectures, many medical students admit they are hardly prepared for their first genital exam. When confronted with their first naked patient they have been known to faint, cry, vomit, become hysterical and sweat.</p>
        <p>''All a student's folkways, all their traditions are being challenged,'' said Cathey Bienkowski, who has coordinated associate programs in the New York City area since 1982. ''We are what we have been brought up to be. We all have certain values about nudity and touching. The whole class is set up to be safe for the student.''</p>
        <p>Josie Hasle, a retired associate who set up the program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey at Newark, added: ''It's such an invasive exam. And everyone who walks through the door has baggage. We help them move it from the personal to the clinical.'' Beginning at Louisiana State University, she since has managed the programs at Tulane, campuses of the University of Texas, the University of Alabama and the State University of New York, among others. With the associates, she said, ''The student gets a nonthreatening teaching environment.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark H. Swartz, director of the Morchand Center for Clinical Competence at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where students from six New York medical schools practice clinical skills, said that reluctance of  doctors to perform routine pelvic examinations needs to be addressed.  ''If you compare the average 25-year-old medical student to the 25-year-old in public relations,'' he said, ''they are very immature. Medical students have had much more of a sheltered social background than nonmedical students. From college they've been so directed toward their career that, in many cases, their social development has been less, and with fewer interactions. They could be very good at science but they haven't begun to pass interpersonal skills 101.''</p>
        <p>That makes such programs even more necessary, said Dr. Lila A. Wallis, a past president of the American Medical Women's Association and founder of Cornell University's associate program. ''It is every woman's right to have a painless, competent, sensitive and communicative exam,'' she said. ''A woman with an unpleasant one in her past means that she won't go for check-ups and jeopardizes her health.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Wallis, an internist, is particularly incensed with doctors who do not perform them. ''A breast and pelvic is just as integral to the exam of a woman as an exam of the mouth, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen and extremities is,'' she said. ''Everything is intertwined in the body. To separate it out is diagnostically invalid.''</p>
        <p>Although the associate programs work in different ways, depending on the school, the model that Ms. Saltzman follows is among the most sophisticated.</p>
        <p>Male and female associates work with small groups of four or five  medical students, residents or practicing doctors enrolled in continuing education programs.</p>
        <p>Women work in teams of two, first demonstrating an ideal doctor-patient interaction, beginning with a knock at the examination room door, through the initial handshake and on through the actual examination. Next, the medical students themselves follow the process, from the door through the examination.</p>
        <p>Ms. Saltzman and her fellow associates are mostly part-time workers. They are often people who are used to being looked at in their other jobs  -- as actors, dancers and models. In a way, they are donating their live bodies to science, for an hourly fee. In New York City, women typically receive $175 for a three-hour session, and men usually make $150 for two hours. Some, like Ms. Saltzman, work more than a dozen of the three-hour sessions each year.</p>
        <p>Male associates function more as live models as a urologist guides the sessions, though the men do interact with the students by answering questions and explaining what is comfortable and what is not during the genital and rectal exams.</p>
        <p>Not everyone can do it, said Robert Speller, an associate for 12 years.  ''Nude, and nude and examined are very different,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For some associates, including Ms. Saltzman, the work brings in more than money. Last month, she said, she taught a medical student who had never had a pelvic exam herself, and by the end of the session, the student was ready to make an appointment.</p>
        <p>Tracey Wang, 23, a second-year medical student, was impressed as well. After a December session of pelvic and breast examinations at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, Ms. Wang said with a mixture of relief and confidence, ''I thought it would be uncomfortable to be instructed from that position, but now I don't see a better way of doing it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Paula Stillman of the Lehigh Valley Health System in Pennsylvania agreed. ''When I went to medical school, we made the same mistakes over and over again,'' said Dr. Stillman, who has worked with associates since the 1970's. ''Even a lot of experienced physicians may not have felt an ovary. When you watch someone doing a pelvic you can't tell what they're feeling. The only way you can really tell is if the person you're doing the exam on can tell you.''</p>
