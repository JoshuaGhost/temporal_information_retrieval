        <p>Brad Nason letter on June 14 article holds polls are being taken too soon before 2000 Presidential vote; says pollsters should worry about whether respondents can distinguish Gov George W Bush from his father, ex-Pres George Bush, only after he declares his Presidential candidacy</p>

        <p>Re ''Wins of the Father Are Visited on the Son'' (Week in Review, June 14): There is a simple solution to the problem created when the public confuses candidates in its response to pollsters: Don't poll, at least not two and a half years before an election. The news media are under no obligation to report every result, although the increased number of media-sponsored polls makes temperance much more difficult.</p>

        <p>When George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas, declares his candidacy for President, then pollsters should worry about whether respondents are able to distinguish him from George H. W. Bush, the former President.</p>
