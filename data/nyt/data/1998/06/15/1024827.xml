        <p>On a searing subtropical afternoon, Hideo Nomo did his part. But the Mets' bullpen wasn't nearly as effective.</p>
        <p>What had figured to be a painless wrap-up to the Mets' four-game series against the Florida Marlins turned into a nightmare.</p>
        <p>A four-run eighth inning allowed the Marlins to tie the game, 4-4, and they won it by 5-4 with a two-out rally in the ninth before 23,924 at Pro Player Stadium.</p>
        <p>The loss dropped the Mets to 37-27 and spoiled the first scoreless outing of the season for Nomo (2-7).</p>
        <p>''This was a very ugly game,'' catcher Alberto Castillo said. ''We just gave it away.''</p>
        <p>The Marlins strung together three straight hits to win it, one coming on a bouncer through shortstop. Rey Ordonez had moved to cover second base on Edgar Renteria's steal attempt. Todd Zeile won the game on a broken-bat single up the middle.</p>
        <p>The Mets' offense collapsed as much as their relief pitching. From the sixth inning on, they were 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>The hitting drought occurred with Butch Huskey, who has had a balky right knee, in the dugout, benched in the sixth inning.</p>
        <p>''I didn't ask to be taken out,'' Huskey said. ''It wasn't my decision.'' Manager Bobby Valentine said Huskey has a ''hobbled knee.''</p>
        <p>The heat apparently made today a bigger challenge for Nomo, the Japanese right-hander acquired recently from the Dodgers. ''These are not his favorite conditions to pitch, from what I have heard,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Adding to the test, the Mets chose to wear black jerseys on this humid 88-degree day, rather than their grays. Actually, Carlos Baerga made the decision after Charlie Samuels, the equipment manager, called out in the locker room for someone to make a choice.</p>
        <p>''It's a lighter uniform,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Nomo struggled with his control from the outset. With one out in the first, Renteria singled, then stole second. Todd Dunwoody walked. But Nomo got out of the inning when Zeile struck out and Castillo threw out Dunwoody on the back end of an attempted double steal.</p>
        <p>In the second, Cliff Floyd doubled to open the inning and Ryan Jackson sacrificed him to third. Then, with a drawn-in infield, Baerga speared Craig Counsell's liner and Nomo struck out Mike Redmond.</p>
        <p>Two more Marlins reached base in the third with one out, but Nomo struck out Dunwoody and induced Zeile to bounce to short.</p>
        <p>After Livan Hernandez, the World Series most valuable player, retired eight straight batters between the first and third innings, the Mets managed a run with two outs in the third. Luis Lopez was hit by a pitch, then Edgardo Alfonzo doubled to the left-center-field wall with Lopez racing home.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo did more clutch hitting in the fifth. Nomo beat out a two-out infield single and Lopez doubled off the left-field wall. Alfonzo hit a full-count fastball to right to score both runners.</p>
        <p>Nomo left after six innings. He allowed four hits, three walks and struck out seven while throwing 93 pitches, 51 for strikes.</p>
        <p>''It was a humid day and he'd done some running,'' Valentine said. ''I thought I'd turn it over to the bullpen.''</p>
        <p>Little did he realize how dicey that would be. Mel Rojas and Brian Bohanon were jolted for four runs in the eighth. Doubles by Renteria and Zeile scored the first two runs, bringing in Bohanon. He gave up a two-run home run to Floyd.</p>
        <p>''I thought I'd keep throwing him inside until he proved he could hit it,'' Bohanon said of Floyd. ''I just didn't do the job.''</p>
        <p>Lopez, the leadoff hitter, was a bright light in this emotional rainstorm. The left fielder had a perfect game. He singled twice, doubled, was hit by a pitch and walked.</p>
        <p>Valentine was asked if this defeat will last a while.</p>
        <p>''Until we play again,'' he said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Catcher MIKE PIAZZA, who missed the last two games with a strained right shoulder, hit the ball hard during batting practice Sunday and likely will play Tuesday, according to Manager BOBBY VALENTINE. . . . Outfielder BERNARD GILKEY, hit on the left eye Friday night, also took batting practice but said he felt ''about the same'' as the day before, when swelling around the eye affected his vision. . . . ARMANDO REYNOSO, who has been bothered with elbow tightness, pitched in a simulated game Sunday, and was expected to start Thursday for Class A Port St. Lucie, Fla. He will see catcher TODD PRATT, who has had a nerve disorder in his right shoulder, and who made his debut for Port St. Lucie on Sunday.</p>
