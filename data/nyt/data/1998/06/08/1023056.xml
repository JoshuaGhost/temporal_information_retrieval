        <p>Universal health care is a reality in one part of the United States: prison.</p>
        <p>By law, inmates are guaranteed medical treatment. And with the ranks of prisoners rising an average of 8 percent every year since 1990, providing that treatment is an expensive proposition. To control costs and improve security, a handful of states are trying out telemedicine -- health care via telecommunications. With government agencies, managed-care providers and legislators watching, these programs are serving as a proving grounds for broadening the use of telemedicine.</p>
        <p>After two decades of limited acceptance as a way to provide health care to people in areas where there are few doctors, telemedicine has been embraced by prison officials as a way to minimize the costs and dangers of transporting inmates to hospitals when they need advanced or specialty care. Most prisons are in rural areas, requiring inmates to travel hours, shackled and under guard, to see a doctor.</p>
        <p>''With telemedicine, prisoners don't even have to leave their cellblock,'' said Dr. Steven Viegas, a hand surgeon who oversees the prison telemedicine project at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1994 and covering roughly 100,000 inmates in 12 prisons, the University of Texas telemedicine program is the nation's oldest and largest. Yearly, the on-line network saves about $300,000 in prisoner transportation costs alone.</p>
        <p>Prisons generally have infirmaries operated by primary-care doctors or nurses. When an inmate needs more than rudimentary care, the jail's medical personnel use specialized equipment -- like electronic stethoscopes and otoscopes -- to transmit real-time audio and high-resolution video images of prisoners to physicians at hospitals hundreds of miles away. Both the off-site doctor and patient have two monitors so they can see each other as well as their own images.</p>
        <p>The hardware costs $60,000 to $100,000 and charges for high-speed phone lines are around $1,000 to $1,500 a month.</p>
        <p>Although statistics are hard to come by because prison telemedicine programs are so new and so few, administrators say their economic benefits go beyond savings in transportation and security. Anecdotal evidence suggests that inmates are more likely to seek care when they do not have to travel to see a doctor.</p>
        <p>''This lower threshold to getting care probably reduces the likelihood of more expensive acute care later on,'' said Dr. Michael G. Kienzle, associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Iowa Hospital in Iowa City, which last year began to extend electronic health care to 4,000 inmates in four state prisons.</p>
        <p>Telemedicine also streamlines the delivery of specialty care. For example, the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center in Charlottesville schedules weekly on-line clinics for jail inmates in such medical specialties as dermatology.</p>
        <p>''The specialist sits at a computer and sees patients from different units all across the state, one after another,'' said Richard J. Settimo, deputy director of the University of Virginia's office of telemedicine, which opened last year to serve 5,000 inmates in five state prisons. ''The ability to block-schedule prisoners saves a whole lot of time and money.''</p>
        <p>The on-site medical staff follows the treatment recommendations of the specialist. If the treatment is complicated, the prisoner is then transported to a hospital.</p>
        <p>The efficiency of prison programs has not escaped the attention of public and private interests responsible for providing health care to people who are not behind bars. Based on its success in treating prisoners, the University of Virginia received a grant from the Commerce Department in October to set up a $1.2 million telemedicine network to serve Medicaid patients in the state's rural southwestern region.</p>
        <p>In January, the University of Iowa's prison project led to a joint venture with a private managed-care company, Help Innovations Inc. of Lawrence, Kan., to provide home health care using telemedicine.</p>
        <p>''We are able to point to our experience in the prisons as evidence of the effectiveness of telemedicine,'' Dr. Kienzle said.</p>
        <p>Two managed-care companies -- Partners Health Care System Inc., based in Boston, and Kaiser Permanente, based in Sacramento, Calif. --  had prison programs in mind when they recently established telemedicine networks as an inexpensive way to serve isolated, homebound elderly and chronically ill subscribers.</p>
        <p>''We knew of the effectiveness of prison care systems and used them as a basis for carving out our own application,'' said Eric Menn, corporate manager of Partners' telemedicine division.</p>
        <p>The military uses telemedicine, as well. For example, the United States Army has a $30 million system in place in Bosnia, linking the medical staff there to physicians at military bases around the world. Its benefits are aimed less at controlling costs than at keeping doctors out of harm's way, though.</p>
        <p>The prison telemedicine systems have provided arguments for reimbursing the expenses of telemedicine when it is used to care for the general population. Currently, telemedicine is generally not covered by Medicare or private insurance.</p>
        <p>Testimony from prison administrators before a Senate ad hoc committee on telemedicine led to the inclusion of a provision in last year's Balanced Budget Act that will require Medicare to pay for telemedicine delivered to certain rural areas found to have a shortage of doctors.</p>
        <p>''The decision makers have definitely been watching what's going on in the prisons,'' said Deborah Dakins, editor of Telemedicine and Telehealth Networks, a bimonthly magazine that tracks the industry.</p>
        <p>Positive preliminary results from these ''test cases'' have modestly increased access to telemedicine in both the public and private health care sectors, she said.</p>
        <p>But it will take more time and more data before it is commonplace for patients outside prison to stick out their tongues and say ''ahhhh'' for a computer.</p>
