        <p>Rain washed out the scheduled game between the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians last night at Yankee Stadium, but it could not mute the machinations of a team trying not to lose a step in its march to become the biggest winner in baseball history.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who did not immediately reschedule the game, have the major leagues' best record at 46-14. But they are being forced to tinker with rotations and lineups because of a glut of successful starters and injuries to Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre took care of one of those problems yesterday by shifting Ramiro Mendoza from the starting rotation to the bullpen after learning that Andy Pettitte, who left Thursday night's game in Montreal with an apparent injury, will not miss a turn.</p>
        <p>Torre told Mendoza, last night's scheduled starter, that he would not only lose the turn but would also have to relinquish his position in the rotation until further notice. That decision came in the wake of two sizzling outings by Orlando Hernandez, who won his first two major league starts while filling in for the injured David Cone and David Wells.</p>
        <p>Now Wells has recovered from a twinge in his left shoulder. Cone has put a dog bite on his pitching hand behind him and will start against the Indians today. And Pettitte is also fine, one day after he was removed because of a sore buttock.</p>
        <p>With six healthy starters, Torre was left with a decision about how to reduce the number to five. It was not a tough choice, even though Torre is a huge fan of Mendoza, who is 4-1 with a 4.00 earned run average.</p>
        <p>Hernandez, conceded Torre, ''is tough to fight.''</p>
        <p>''Mendoza hasn't done anything wrong,'' Torre said, but he added that the ease with which Hernandez ''pitched the other day was pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Mendoza was informed of the change of role before the Yankees officially postponed last night's game. He left the clubhouse before Torre informed reporters and was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Torre said he had emphasized to Mendoza his continued importance to the team, primarily in innings such as the sixth and seventh, where other relievers have struggled of late. Mendoza's sinker and ability to coax ground-ball outs and double plays made him successful in such a role at times last year.</p>
        <p>''What works against him is he has done it before,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>So the manager tried to couch the news in terms of its not being a demotion but admitted, ''at first blush, he's not buying this; he buys it, but it's disappointing to him.''</p>
        <p>Still, the decision had to be made, if only to settle one of the team's few problems, Torre said. The other one -- the lineup -- remained unresolved, however. Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop and No. 2 hitter, is suffering from a strained abdominal muscle and is not scheduled to come off the disabled list until next Sunday. Williams, the center fielder and cleanup hitter, sprained his right knee on Wednesday night and is out at least two more weeks.</p>
        <p>''Right now my challenge is trying to figure out a lineup,'' Torre said. ''It's so easy when you have Bernie in there. Now, it's trying to find the combination I'll be comfortable with. But as far as the challenge, it's still the pitching. If we pitch, I think we have enough ways we can score runs to be able to offset our losses.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>RICKY LEDEE, who signed with the Yankees as a 16-year-old in 1990, finally got his first call to the major leagues on Thursday when he was informed by his manager at Class AAA Columbus, STUMP MERRILL, that he would take BERNIE WILLIAMS's roster spot. ''He called me in and told me I was scratched from the lineup -- 'you're going to the big club,' he said,'' said Ledee, his eyes welling as he spoke yesterday. ''I couldn't talk, I couldn't say anything. I started to shake, I was so nervous.'' . . . ANDY PETTITTE, who felt a twinge in the buttocks while running out a sacrifice bunt on Thursday, was checked yesterday by the team physician, Dr. STUART HERSHON, ''for about 10 seconds, and I'm fine,'' the pitcher said. . . . Williams, though ambiguous about suffering his first knee injury during an awkward slide into third base, was also relieved. ''Whenever you hear it's going to be two weeks, that's better than surgery,'' he said. ''It's still sensitive to the touch, but I can walk on it, which is good.''</p>
