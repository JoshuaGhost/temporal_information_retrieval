        <p>Labor Secretary Alexis Herman gave the Clinton Administration's support this week to a proposed treaty to outlaw the most exploitative forms of child labor.</p>
        <p>Secretary Herman said she hoped that a mechanism to be included in the treaty calling for follow-up reporting of abuses would encourage countries to abide by their pledges to end economic exploitation of children.</p>
        <p>The new initiative, at the International Labor Organization, comes 25 years after the body first tried to curb such abuses. But nearly two-thirds of the I.L.O.'s 174 member nations, particularly developing countries, chose not to sign it. The United States itself did not sign.</p>
        <p>That convention barred children under 15 from working, except in the poorest countries where the age was set at 13. And no child under 18 could work in heavy industry.</p>
        <p>The new convention takes a more limited approach, focusing on such extreme forms of child labor as working in mines and prostitution. The proposal could be ready for nations to sign next year.</p>
        <p>Surveys indicate that about 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 work worldwide.</p>
        <p>Ms. Herman announced that the Administration planned to ask Congress for $30 million -- a large increase over the current $3 million contribution -- for the I.L.O.'s project to help countries cope with child-labor abuses. More than 20 countries have applied for help in eliminating dangerous child labor.</p>
