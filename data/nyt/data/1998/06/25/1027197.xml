        <p>Nine days after the Stanley Cup finals, the National Hockey League treadmill speeds up this week with an important owners meeting, the annual awards ceremony, the expansion draft for the Nashville team and the entry draft for 18-year-old amateurs.</p>
        <p>After that, team executives will return to their offices next week for the beginning of the free-agent signing season. Training camps open in about 10 weeks.</p>
        <p>The owners, meeting as the Board of Governors on Thursday, are expected to pass several rules designed to increase offense. Assuming they follow the recommendations of their general managers, they will move the goal lines out two feet, from 11 to 13 feet from the back boards, will reduce the size of the goal crease so attacking forwards can get closer to the net and will assign two referees, instead of one, for a limited number of games. They may also discuss a proposal to award three points for a victory, instead of two, if won in regulation time. An overtime victory would be worth two points and an overtime defeat worth one.</p>
        <p>And the governors are likely to create the Maurice Richard trophy to honor the leading goal scorer. In addition, the board might learn of candidates to replace Brian Burke, who left his position as N.H.L. senior vice president and director of hockey operations to take a job as president and general manager of the Vancouver Canucks. One candidate is Colin Campbell, a former Rangers coach.</p>
        <p>Although the league is adding four expansion teams over the next three years, some owners say they are losing money. The players association recently announced that the average player salary last season was $1.168 million, up more than 18 percent in one year and up from $572,161 in 1993-94, the season before the 15-week lockout. Commissioner Gary Bettman, who recently said the vital signs of the business are good, is likely to discuss these and other numbers.</p>
        <p>Dominik Hasek of Buffalo is the favorite to repeat as winner of the Hart and the Vezina trophies, which go to the most valuable player and the best goalie, respectively. The other Hart candidates are Teeumu Selanne of Anaheim and Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh. The other Vezina candidates are Martin Brodeur of the Devils and Tom Barrasso of Pittsburgh. Candidates for the Norris trophy, given to the best defenseman, are Niklas Lidstrom of Detroit, Rob Blake of Los Angeles and Chris Pronger of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>The Calder trophy, for best rookie, will go to either to Sergei Samsonov of Boston, Patrik Elias of the Devils or Mattias Ohlund of Vancouver. Wayne Gretzky of the Rangers is one of three candidates for the Lady Byng trophy for skill and sportsmanship. The Adams trophy, given to the coach of the year, will probably go to Pat Burns of Boston.</p>
        <p>The party moves to Buffalo for the expansion draft on Friday in which the Nashville Predators and their general manager, David Poile, will choose 26 players from the 26 established teams. Poile is a close friend of Neil Smith, the president and general manager of the Rangers.</p>
        <p>It has been speculated that Poile will choose as one of his three goalies Mike Richter of the Rangers, who can become an unrestricted free agent July 1. By choosing him, and making no attempt to sign him, Poile would acquire for his team the rights to a second-round draft choice in 1999 as compensation for Richter's signing with another team. And Nashville's choosing of Richter would protect the Rangers from losing another goalie in the 1999 expansion draft, when Atlanta joins, because a team cannot lose two goalies to expansion drafts in two successive years.</p>
        <p>The entry draft, Saturday in Marine Midland Arena, is likely to feature center Vincent Lecavalier of Rimouski in the Quebec League as the top pick. Tampa Bay chooses first. The Rangers choose seventh, the Islanders ninth, the Devils 26th.</p>
        <p>As for free agents, they can take bids starting next Wednesday. Among the unrestricted are Richter of the Rangers, Doug Gilmour of the Devils, Brett Hull of St. Louis, Ron Francis of Pittsburgh and Steve Duchesne of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Among the restricted are Blake of Los Angeles, Dimitri Khristich of Boston, Aleksei Zhitnik of Buffalo, Sandis Ozolinsh of Colorado, Tomas Holmstrom of Detroit, Curtis Joseph of Edmonton, Doug Weight of Edmonton, Saku Koivu of Montreal, Scott Niedermayer of the Devils, Kenny Johnsson, Zigmund Palffy and Trevor Linden of the Islanders, Rod Brind'Amour of Philadelphia, Pierre Turgeon of St. Louis and Joe Juneau of Washington.</p>
        <p>Teams signing restricted free agents risk owing their former teams up to five first-round draft choices as compensation.</p>
