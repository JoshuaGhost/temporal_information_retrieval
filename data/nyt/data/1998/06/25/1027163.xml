        <p>FAMILY MAN  By Calvin Trillin  184 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $20.</p>
        <p>Here, in the 16 funny essays composing ''Family Man,'' is Calvin Trillin, the humorist, on the subjects of raising children and staying married. His advice is succinct. On children: ''Try to get one that doesn't spit up. Otherwise you're on your own.'' On finding a long-term wife: ''Wander into the right party.''</p>
        <p>Beyond that, ''Handing out advice on family matters is not my game,'' he writes. ''For most people, the process of rearing children is so all-encompassing that there isn't any way to adhere to any policy that doesn't coincide with their natural way of doing things. Getting advice on the best way to bring up children is like getting advice on the best way to breathe; sooner or later, you're probably going to forget it and go back to your regular old in-and-out.''</p>
        <p>Instead of giving advice, Mr. Trillin uses these essays to  knit together his many anecdotes and routines on the subject of family, some of which have appeared in different form in The New Yorker and other magazines. These subjects touch on, for instance, using your family as material for your writing. His rules here are: not during the sensitive teen-age years and no embarrassing stuff unless you're sure you're Dostoyevsky. Otherwise, as he puts it to his wife: ''I hope you're not under the impression that what you just said was off the record, Alice. Nobody  mentioned anything about deep background or not for attribution or anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Or his subject might be the genetic differences between men and women, which occasions him to write about roller coasters, asparagus, movies, eating alone, ''what's au courant in clothes,'' lobsters, James Carville and Mary Matalin, cooking, scenery, day people and night people and his belief ''that in the spring female human beings get a deep biological urge to replace the living-room slipcovers.''</p>
        <p>Or he will write about pets. It's not that he hates cats. That would be prejudice. ''What might be fair to say is that I have never met a cat I liked.'' It seems to him ''that many of the attributes cat fanciers apply to cats -- independence, the ability to care for themselves, an admirable absence of obsequiousness toward human beings -- can be claimed for periwinkles as well, and in a much more manageable package.''</p>
        <p>But no matter what his topic, the boundaries between them are seamless. Some of his most graceful writing is in his transitions.  His timing and delivery are perfect.  He doesn't ring an off-key note. In ''Nuptials du Jour,'' he will be pondering the subject of gay marriages, his only problem with them being, ''At the end of a gay Jewish wedding ceremony, how would you decide who stomps on the glass?''</p>
        <p>Suddenly you find yourself attending the birth of the Trillins' first child, Abigail, prepared for by the Lamaze method. The author has accepted the obstetrician's invitation to change into scrubs and join him for delivery. ''Having heeded his warning not to leave my wallet in the locker with the rest of my clothing, I was holding it in my hand as we entered the delivery room; scrubs have no pockets. Then I realized that the elastic in the pants I'd been provided had about given out -- I suppose it makes sense to use the older outfits for new fathers for a while, before throwing them away -- so I had to hold up my pants with the other hand. As I neared the delivery table, Alice reached out to take my hand, as we had seen so many women do in the movies shown in natural childbirth classes. I had no hand available.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trillin's secret, besides his command of prose, is that he knows exactly who he is. The family joke may be, as Abigail puts it, that he's ''a simple lad from the Midwest'' married to ''a fancy Eastern girl.''  But he comes from Kansas City in the ''show me'' state. He's a thoroughly urban person with insatiable curiosity and contempt for pretense, especially in himself. He writes for The Nation only because it's ''the closest magazine to my house.'' He summers in Nova Scotia, where  neighbors speak a distinctive, not particularly grammatical form of English. He plans to hold his daughters' wedding receptions in the Triple Eight Palace, ''a huge dim sum parlor on the second floor of a Chinese shopping mall under the Manhattan Bridge.''</p>
        <p>Of course the mask of humor Mr. Trillin wears also serves as his armor, which bars us from seeing any sadness in his life. Occasional bad news does get out: Alice's bout with lung cancer, his own heart bypass surgery. But the visor quickly slams shut. He writes that after his operation, the surgeon advised him and his family how often he was to nap and how he was to avoid long periods at his desk. ''We all nodded soberly. When he had finished, I tried to look both brave and prudent. Then Abigail said, 'I hate to say it, Daddy, but it's hard to see just how that differs from your regular routine.' ''</p>
        <p>One is left to wonder if the mask ever slips, if he's ever caught off guard, if he ever blunders clumsily.  But it's no use. On a first-grade outing when a boy who is holding his hand suddenly asks him, ''Are you divorced yet?'' he shoots right back, ''Not yet.''</p>
        <p>Is there a less than entertaining moment reading these essays?</p>
