        <p>A burst water main in midtown Manhattan flooded the sub-basement of the Museum of Modern Art yesterday, endangering two dozen crates of artwork awaiting shipment, museum officials said. No art was damaged because the crates were stored 6 to 10 inches off the floor.</p>
        <p>Two to three inches of water filled the building's sub-basement, which is not open to the public, after a truck ran over a six-inch water main supplying a midtown Manhattan hydrant, officials said.</p>
        <p>''Our conservators immediately evacuated everything that was down there and double-checked to make sure everything did not get wet,'' Glenn D. Lowry, the museum's director, said. ''The range of objects that were down there did not include anything of extraordinary importance.'' He said that he could not name the specific works, but that the sub-basement was generally used only for less valuable items.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lowry, citing fears of another such break, said the museum would study whether to build a protective wall -- he called it a box within a box -- to seal off its basement from future water main breaks. ''We've been here since 1929 and to the best of my knowledge this has never happened before,'' he said. ''After this, we're increasingly aware of how fragile and vulnerable we are to these kind of crises.''</p>
        <p>The rupturing of the pipe on West 53d Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues was the third highly publicized water main break in the city this year. In January, a 48-inch water main burst, creating a huge, car-swallowing sinkhole and a flame of natural gas two stories high on Fifth Avenue. In March, a sprinkler line burst, nearly drowning a 22-year-old woman and her terrier trapped in their Upper East Side apartment building elevator.</p>
        <p>But city officials say that despite appearances, manmade deluges are not growing more common. Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff in the Department of Environmental Protection, said that a recent analysis by the department found that the number of water main breaks in New York has remained the same since the 1970's, about 550 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowry said that employees working in a nearby brownstone, which had been converted into an office by the museum, heard the sound of running water coming from the basement just before 1 P.M. An employee opened a storage room door to find a funnel of water pouring out of the wall. ''Imagine a fire hydrant with a valve open,'' Mr. Lowry said.</p>
        <p>The basement of that brownstone, at 41 West 53d Street, eventually filled with 10 feet of water, Fire Department officials said. Water then flooded the basements of two adjoining brownstones to the east, at 37 and 39 West 53d. Finally, water burst through the wall of a stairwell leading to the museum building's sub-basement, its lowest level, at 11 West 53d Street, and flowed downstairs to where the crated artwork was stored.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sturcken said local residents told city officials that a truck had run over the hydrant two weeks ago. Another truck ran over what was left of the hydrant yesterday, ramming a protruding section of pipe into the ground and causing the pipe below the street to burst. City officials said they had no record of anyone's having previously reported the initial hydrant damage to city agencies.</p>
