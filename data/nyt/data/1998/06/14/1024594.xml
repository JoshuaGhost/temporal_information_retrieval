        <p>In a college neighborhood east of the historic Mormon Temple here this week, four young Southern Baptist men and women bowed their heads with Clint Roberts, whose T-shirt asks, ''What's more important than eternal life?''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Roberts, director of the Baptist Campus Ministry at the nearby University of Utah, asked  God's blessing, the group set off to knock on doors to talk with students about conversion and salvation.</p>
        <p>No one answered at the first house, and a woman turned them away at the next. But at the third, a university fraternity, the door was opened wide and the group invited in.</p>
        <p>''I have a personal testimony that God has helped me,'' Ann-Marie Sandy told five fraternity members seated on a long couch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts talked about the campus ministry and invited the young men to visit.</p>
        <p>They listened attentively, answered a couple of questions and then indicated they wanted to turn back to their studies. Later, they agreed that admitting the group had been the proper thing to do.</p>
        <p>''I went on a mission, too,'' said Jonathan Nielsen, referring to the months he spent in Bogota, Colombia, as a Mormon missionary. ''So I know how it is.''</p>
        <p>Over the last week, in meetings like these, members of two of the most determinedly missionary faiths in the United States, the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have been coming face to face in what has been a courteous if somewhat wary encounter.</p>
        <p>That it has been happening here, on ground that the 19th-century Mormon leader Brigham Young declared a modern-day Zion, is the work of the Southern Baptists. While holding their annual convention in here this week, about 3,000 volunteers also began a weeklong effort ending today to bring an evangelical Protestant message to the two million inhabitants of Greater Salt Lake, Mormon and non-Mormon alike.</p>
        <p>''We're looking at the biggest evangelistic outreach in the Salt Lake Valley in history,'' said Phil Roberts, an official with the Baptists' North American Mission Board (and no relation to Clint Roberts). ''There may be as many as 50,000 personal knocks on the door,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Backed by a $600,000 budget, Southern Baptists bought television and radio commercials, put up billboards, dispatched mailings and held block parties, all to draw attention to their message.</p>
        <p>Word of the plans began to circulate a year ago, prompting speculation about tensions and raising the specter of finger-jabbing debates between Baptists and Mormons.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the oratory within the Salt Palace Convention Center, where the Baptists met from Tuesday through Thursday, sometimes grew hot, as when one minister opened a sermon by calling Salt Lake City the ''headquarters of a counterfeit Christianity.'' And pamphlets published by the mission board strongly criticized Mormon beliefs, including that the church's president is a prophet capable of receiving divine revelation.</p>
        <p>But on the streets, it was mainly a case of the polite meeting the polite.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone was very concerned that there not be hostilities expressed,'' Phil Roberts said. ''I've warned our people that you may win an argument, but you may not win a person.''</p>
        <p>For months, Mormon officials had offered similar counsel. In a speech at Brigham Young University in February, Elder Boyd K. Packer, a top church officer, said: ''If you meet someone who challenges our right to the title Christian, do not confront them. Teach them -- peaceably.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, another Mormon leader, Elder Alexander B. Morrison, who supervises the church's work in northern Utah, said: ''If all you do is position yourself to respond to what other folks say of you, you don't get much done in this world. The Baptist convention has been interesting, but not very disruptive in terms of our responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>During the convention, Southern Baptist officials kept a tally of the fruits of their efforts. On Tuesday, after volunteers had been in the field four days, John Yarborough, the mission board's vice president, announced, ''We have seen over 760 people pray to receive Christ on the streets and in the homes of Salt Lake City.'' Those numbers, he added, ''are not mere accounting digits, but represent souls in the Kingdom.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Baptist messengers, as convention delegates are called, broke into applause at the announcement that conversions had topped 1,000.</p>
        <p>But apparently relatively few were Mormons. Baptist officials said that most of the converts seemed to come from among the unaffiliated, a group that has grown as Utah's population has swollen with arrivals from other states. Indeed, Mormons now make up slightly less than 50 percent of Salt Lake City's population,  church officials say.</p>
        <p>In response to the increasing number of non-Mormons, the Mormons began their own continuing missionary effort in northern Utah in the 1980's and now field a force of nearly 500 missionaries there. They make about 6,000 converts a year, about 2 percent of the church's annual total  worldwide, Elder Morrison said. ''In general, we do very, very well where we are well-known,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among the Southern Baptists, who were planning a special outreach to the local Hispanic population this weekend, the volunteer evangelists said what counted was making contact with anyone who would listen.</p>
        <p>''We just want to share with them as much as we can,'' said David Paul, a senior from Baylor University in Waco, Tex. ''What we're trying to do is plant seeds.''</p>
