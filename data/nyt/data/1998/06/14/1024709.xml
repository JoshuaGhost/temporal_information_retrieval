        <p>NIXON IN WINTER</p>
        <p>By Monica Crowley.</p>
        <p>428 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $30.</p>
        <p>Monica Crowley is one of the great comic writers of our time. But she doesn't get her own jokes. In ''Nixon in Winter,'' she nods sagely while Richard Nixon tells her how he chastised Chinese leaders over the Tiananmen massacre. Then, in a typical Nixon duck, he remembers that students were killed at Kent State during his first term. But the Kent State students were not protesting Communism: ''Those kids were Communists.'' She just records the absurdity with a straight face.</p>
        <p>In fact, she increases Nixon's store of absurdities. One day she tells him that she is enthusiastically reading a book (''Silent Coup'') that asserts the Watergate break-in was ordered by John Dean to uncover his wife's connections with a call-girl ring. Nixon, who claims he never reads Watergate accounts, encourages her to finish the book and tell him about it. She is so carried away by the authors' ''evenhanded approach'' that she writes to thank them for their service to the truth. Nixon hears this gladly and says the book ''should have gotten far more attention.''</p>
        <p>At another time, he asks Crowley, ''Why do you think people hate me?'' She says it is because he was so effective against Alger Hiss and Hiss's defenders, and because of ''the threat he represented as a conservative continually able to command the headlines.'' Nixon has to agree that ''the problem with Bush is that no one hates him.'' George Bush was not effective against the Communist foe -- he only managed the dismantling of the Soviet empire, a feat that fills Nixon with bitter envy: ''Bush and Baker suffered from a great lack of creativity in foreign policy; it was a damn shame that they were in charge at the end of the cold war.'' She agrees that their trouble is their refusal to take his advice on dumping Mikhail Gorbachev -- just as she finds a certain wisdom in Clinton when he backs most-favored-nation status for China because ''Clinton had decided that Nixon was right.''</p>
        <p>Why would Nixon, in 1989, make a senior at Colgate (as Crowley was) the object of his confidences, and then find in her his closest intellectual companion for the rest of his life? He saw or talked to her daily from 1990 to 1994, took her with him to Russia and China, introduced her to world leaders, went to her house so she could witness him making an important phone call, included her in family holidays. The official reason was that she was his research assistant. Luckily, in Nixon's case, there is no question of a sexual interest. She had what mattered more to him than sex -- an unquestioning adulation perpetually on tap.</p>
        <p>Court fools were supposed to have been employed in the past to give kings a daily reminder of their flaws. Crowley was a fool in reverse. She was there to tell Nixon, constantly, what a great man he was. Her real role in preparing his books was to say that the world cried out for insights that only he could supply. Time and again Nixon fishes for compliments. Can he really bring off such a daunting task as adding another to his long list of unread books? ''I gave him my usual reassurances that the country and the world needed to hear from him,'' she tells us.</p>
        <p>Crowley's duties were extensive, enough to test anyone's adoration quotient; but they broke down to three main ones. She had to hear over and over, from his own lips, and then endorse, the claims that Nixon was a wise man, and a powerful one, and virtuous. She does not sort things into these categories, but it is useful, in cataloguing the humor, to do so.</p>
        <p>1. Nixon was a wise man, even a scholar. In order to show that, Nixon had to be seen reading the great thinkers when Crowley arrived at his house. One day he is renewing his acquaintance with ''The Republic,'' and he gives her a little lecture on ''the bottom line for Plato.'' In one of her better comic strokes she tells us, ''Two days later he had dispensed with Plato and turned his attention to Aristotle.'' Soon after this, she says he tells her that he has been ''giving another cursory reading to Immanuel Kant's 'On History.' '' In other sermons he gives her Machiavelli, Locke, Tocqueville and Nietzsche in a nutshell.</p>
        <p>But Nixon is not only a theoretical thinker. He has practical advice that will spell success or failure for leaders. When Bush cooperates with Gorbachev, he asks, ''Has Bush lost his mind?'' He complains: ''I guess he felt that since Gorbachev looked him straight in the eye . . . gosh, he must be a good guy, on our side. Wrong! Smart leaders act on behalf of their national interest, personal relationship be damned.'' Bush's Secretary of State, James Baker, also pins too much hope on one man (Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze). But then Nixon meets Boris Yeltsin, who ''looks you straight in the eye.'' He takes Crowley to meet Yeltsin and feel his force, and says that everything in Russia depends on his prevailing. Crowley, who has been writing anti-Gorbachev essays for Nixon, agrees entirely. She felt the force.</p>
        <p>2. Nixon was a powerful man. Oddly enough, it was his very power that brought him down. He had to be destroyed because he posed such a threat. If Watergate had not occurred, some other excuse would have been found. He was on the verge of creating the new conservative majority: ''I was going to start with newspaper reporters. . . . I was going to get conservatives in there to take these people on. That's why in '72 they had to bring me down. They knew I was after them and that I'd succeed.''</p>
        <p>After his fall, he says, the news media had to keep ''wallowing in Watergate'' because ''they were afraid of a comeback because of my record on that score.'' Even in his final years, he threatens others with his power. He may go public against Bush and Baker: ''If they don't take a harder line on Gorbachev now, I will have to seriously consider my options.'' Like Lear, he still feels regal (though vaguely): ''If Bush blows it at the end, I will -- well, I don't know what I'll do. But it won't be quiet, it won't be private, but it will have an impact. I guarantee that.'' Lear, it is true, says, ''I will do such things -- What they are yet I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the earth.'' But Crowley's Nixon is more Edward Lear than Shakespeare's king.</p>
        <p>3. Nixon was a virtuous man. Sometimes the claim is made positively -- he revered his mother, he believed in God, he did not cheat on Pat. But more frequently he proves his superiority by noting how rotten everybody else is. He despises other ex-Presidents -- ''he resented being grouped with them,'' and he blew up at Bush for sending an emissary to him ''on the same day that he was sending him to talk to Ford and Carter and Reagan.'' Bush is a lightweight, Baker an egotist -- and those are just the people on his side. As for Democrats, Hillary Rodham Clinton is ''cold as ice''; Janet Reno is ''a partisan witch.'' Bill Clinton was all right for a period, when he flattered Nixon, but Whitewater is worse than Watergate because ''we didn't have a body'' like Vince Foster's. Intellectuals and Ivy Leaguers are worthless -- that is the trouble with the Foreign Service, the Democratic Party and the press. One of the few people Nixon expresses unqualified admiration for is Oliver North: ''North and Weinberger got to the heart of it, like I did with Hiss. They were against the goddamned Commies!''</p>
        <p>Crowley assures us Nixon wanted her to relay the wisdom imported to her, which recalls a different play of Shakespeare:</p>
        <p>O God, Horatio, what a wounded name,</p>
        <p>Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!</p>
        <p>And so:</p>
        <p>Thou livest, report me and my cause aright</p>
        <p>To the unsatisfied.</p>
        <p>In her Horatio role, Crowley testifies to the kind of man she served. But what kind of man was that? One who needed a young and unchallenging acolyte to hear him rant and boast. A deficient human being desperate to fill some inner emptiness. One forever pulling himself down by trying to pull down others. To all of this Crowley bears accurate if unwitting testimony.
