        <p>Thomas O'Brien knows a thing or two about fabulous rooms. The designer's six-year-old firm, Aero Studios, has decorated houses for Ralph Lauren (a former employer), and designed commercial interiors for Giorgio Armani, the restaurateur Ken Aretsky and the upscale bath store Waterworks, to name a few A-list clients. But the room O'Brien waxes most rhapsodic about these days is his own living room -- a glamorous, double-height space on the 17th floor of a prewar midtown apartment building.</p>
        <p>O'Brien vividly recalls his real-estate coup de foudre. Having first poked around the apartment's one small bedroom, tiny kitchen and dark hallways, O'Brien was amazed by the living room, which was bathed in gentle north light from a pair of tall, slender casement windows. ''I walked into this incredibly beautiful space,'' he says, ''and I thought that nothing bad could happen to me here.'' (The apartment's terrace and fireplace didn't hurt, either.)</p>

        <p>The rooms, now thoroughly renovated, are decorated in O'Brien's signature mix. His disciplined eye for clean lines and rich but neutral colors, as well as his intuitive sense of scale, allow him to pair an 18th-century chair with a 20th-century table for an undeniably modern result. Yet, O'Brien notes, the spaces ''feel warm and inviting.'' So much so, in fact, that the designer vows, ''I'll never move again.''</p>
