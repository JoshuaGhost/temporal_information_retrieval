        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Assuming her tongue wasn't in cheek, Lorna Graham's insights into ''us'' New Yorkers are about as thoughtless as Seinfeld and company at their worst (best?) (''Juvenile City,'' May 17.</p>
        <p>Even accepting -- and I don't -- the premise that ''Seinfeld'' represents New York, television has offered few models of what it means to be ''grown up.'' Between action drama and sophomoric sitcom there's no place to depict the kind of involved, creative and contemplative living that is the privilege of adulthood. So blaming New York for the characters of ''Seinfeld'' is like blaming flowers for manure. If New Yorkers don't act ''grown up,'' it's because of sitcoms, not vice versa.</p>
        <p>And having kids is not the cure. As one who has negotiated the baby-stroller minefields of upper Broadway, I'll tell you that bringing up baby only gives such people more to be self-absorbed about.</p>
