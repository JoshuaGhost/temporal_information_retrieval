        <p>WITH the birth of Euroland less than seven months away, it's high time for a deep rethinking of how American investors approach Europe.</p>
        <p>Euroland is popular shorthand for the one-currency, 11-country monetary union and financial market area that will come into being on Jan. 1. It brings with it many promising opportunities for companies and investors alike. At the same time, it threatens to make some familiar investing strategies obsolete, and it raises the question of whether betting on just this single-currency market is a good idea.</p>
        <p>Americans have shown a surging interest recently in Europe, with record flows of cash into European stock mutual funds. But the American financial services industry does not appear to be in a rush to change what it is now offering its investors and seems to be ignoring products like a Euroland index fund or a broad choice of actively managed Euroland mutual funds.</p>
        <p>In fact, some argue that focusing on just the 10 active Euroland stock markets (Luxembourg has none) would mean missing good returns elsewhere in Europe.</p>
        <p>''The Euroland concept, from a narrow perspective of creating funds, is a flawed one,'' said Nicholas Bratt, the head of the global equity group at Scudder Kemper Investments. ''We would simply buy the best company we could find in Europe regardless of is specific domicile.''</p>
        <p>Investors face more questions than just geography. The role that indexes and index funds will play in the new region's markets is far from certain. And perhaps most important is the developing shift to a new investing style that selects stocks by sector rather than by country. Here is how these themes may play out in the new Europe.</p>
        <p>Sectors vs. Nations</p>
        <p>Before Euroland, European equity strategists began by picking a country, based on the forecast for interest rates, growth, earnings and inflation. Then they chose stocks in countries with the best outlook.</p>
        <p>That system, analysts argue, will not be as effective now, because the new European Central Bank will try to keep interest rates and economic performance more in line for all Euroland countries.</p>
        <p>That does not mean there will not be differences within Euroland, but it does mean that the era of making millions by exploiting them is over.</p>
        <p>''Now it will be what sectors are most promising and what are the best stocks in that sector,'' said William P. Sterling, global strategist at BEA Associates, an investment management firm.</p>
        <p>This new style spells trouble for popular closed-end single-country funds which, unless they adapt, will struggle to produce attractive returns, some analysts say.</p>
        <p>''It slams the lid down on single-country funds,'' said Michael T. Porter, a country fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. (Article, page 6.)</p>
        <p>Exchange-listed American depository receipts, another familiar way for Americans to invest in Europe, should remain attractive. Because they are priced in dollars, trade on American exchanges and conform to American accounting rules, they are easy for Americans to follow. (Unlisted A.D.R.'s trade over the counter and need not meet American standards.)</p>
        <p>As always, an A.D.R.'s dollar value depends on movements in both the price of the underlying European stock and the value of the currency. Monetary union will eliminate the currency fluctuations among member nations, but their shared currency, the euro, will still rise and fall relative to the dollar.</p>
        <p>Only a minority of top European companies trade as A.D.R.'s, however, and for some investors, the exposure they offer may not be broad enough.</p>
        <p>For example, the Bank of New York compiles an index of 107 exchange-listed A.D.R.'s for Euroland, but many of the top 10 stocks in market capitalization for each country are missing. The bank is designing a product that would allow American investors to buy the A.D.R. index, but there are no details yet.</p>
        <p>Seeking a Gauge</p>
        <p>American investors love index funds, which simply buy all the stocks in a widely followed index like the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. No Euroland analogue yet exists, and creating one will not be easy. One obstacle will be distinguishing for Americans between Europe and Euroland.</p>
        <p>Dow Jones Indexes, along with the French, German and Swiss stock markets, has started a family of indexes for Europe and for Euroland collectively called Stoxx. Morgan Stanley Capital International introduced a 335-stock index for Euroland on April 30. Standard &amp; Poor's, The Financial Times of London and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company have a 351-stock Eurobloc index, and The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange  have a 100-stock index.</p>
        <p>But these companies have been more successful in selling their indexes to fund managers and institutional investors as benchmarks for performance than in bringing index trading to American investors. None has a retail product ready to see daylight, though Dow Jones is promising one.</p>
        <p>Suzanne M. Crosby, director of global marketing at Morgan Stanley, said, ''Marketing Europe from a U.S. perspective is not a big revenue opportunity now.''</p>
        <p>Not even the Vanguard Group, the index fund leader, has plans for a Euroland fund. ''We take a long-term view of things,'' said Brian S. Mattes, Vanguard's spokesman. ''It must be a durable investment need, and it must go on for years.'' The company doesn't think Euroland passes the test.</p>
        <p>Index investing by country can be done through the World Equity Benchmark Shares, or Webs, traded on the American Stock Exchange; they are based on Morgan Stanley country indexes. But no pan-European or Euroland Webs are planned.</p>
        <p>Europe vs. Euroland</p>
        <p>While there is hardly a rush to offer Euroland plays directly to American investors, plenty of analysts in the United States and Europe are trying to anticipate Euroland's effects and to spot ways to profit.</p>
        <p>One is the index effect. The new indexes that aspire to become benchmarks include  stocks that received scant attention in the country-picking era but will now be bought simply because of index membership.</p>
        <p>''The visibility gainers are the ones in the smaller countries like Ireland, Austria, Portugal and Belgium,'' said Mark Howdle, European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in London.</p>
        <p>Euroland will also provoke major shifts in existing portfolios, analysts argue. Money managers in specific European countries who view Euroland as a single market will de-emphasize domestic stocks and buy across borders. This shift, which seems to have begun, will move prices of many issues.</p>
        <p>Ian Scott, the European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, noted in a recent report that the weighting for German stocks in a Euroland index would be around 27 percent, but by his estimate, German institutions and money managers now have 70 percent of their assets in German equities.</p>
        <p>''On this evidence, there is plenty of scope for German institutions to diversify their portfolios,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Some analysts argue that smaller-company stocks will be hurt most, as they are sold by money managers to make room for bigger stocks from other countries.</p>
        <p>Murali Ramaswami, global head of equities derivative research at Lehman Brothers, said that while European stocks in general were becoming more sensitive to industry factors than to country factors, some companies and sectors would continue to be country-sensitive. He found commercial banks in France, Germany, Italy and Spain to be in that category.</p>
        <p>Conversely, he said, the most industry-sensitive stocks varied from country to country: property and casualty insurance in France; mining, metals and minerals in Germany, and automobiles and utilities in Italy.</p>
        <p>An increase in cross-border mergers within Euroland will also buoy some stocks, analysts predict, as consolidation picks up speed in oil, construction and -- especially in Italy -- in financial services.</p>
        <p>Consumers taking advantage of monetary union to travel and to buy second homes may help some Euroland companies. On the other hand, the simplification of cross-border comparison shopping may hurt profits of airlines, retailers and brand-name goods makers accustomed to tailoring their prices from country to country.</p>
        <p>But analysts point out that these factors do not add up to a night-and-day difference between investment opportunities inside and outside Euroland. American mutual fund managers seem to prefer Europe to Euroland as a playing field in both stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>Analysts agree that the unified Euroland government bond market will be larger and more liquid than the present array of national markets. But many say it is not an attractive bet right now, while potentially more enticing markets for corporate bonds and junk bonds will take time to develop.</p>
        <p>Peter Askew, executive vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International in London, said fixed-income investors would do best in a broader European or international bond fund that can take advantage of European opportunities outside Euroland.</p>
        <p>Some analysts are betting on Greece, which hopes to join the union in the second round a few years from now. The required sharp cuts in Greek interest rates would mean big capital gains for bondholders, in the kind of ''convergence play'' that paid off handsomely as Italy and others prepared for Euroland's birth. (Article, page 7.)</p>
        <p>N. Graham Allen, the managing director for global fixed-income at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, likes Britain, the biggest European player not in Euroland, for the same reason; he thinks Britain will decide to join before too long.</p>
        <p>Equity analysts also say it is difficult to ignore Britain. A Euroland stock fund, Mr. Bratt of Scudder Kemper said, ''omits the largest stock market in Europe, and that seems undesirable to me.'' He said his company's closed-end New Europe fund also includes emerging markets like Poland and Hungary that he would be loath to exclude by investing solely in Euroland.</p>
        <p>Stock markets are performing well across Europe, so for American investors, the question of Euroland versus all of Europe may seem academic. The important choice is whether to invest in Europe, by any definition, or not.</p>
