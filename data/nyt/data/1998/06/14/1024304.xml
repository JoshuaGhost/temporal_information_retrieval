        <p>WHEN it was completed and blessed in 1958, the shrine grotto at Lourdes in Litchfield quickly drew pilgrims to its peaceful, sylvan setting. They lit candles beneath its rocky dome and walked the Stations of the Cross in a wooded hillock that echoed with birdsong and the rushing water of a nearby stream. They roamed its 150 acres but rarely encountered the 40 seminarians who lived in the big house on the hill.</p>

        <p>WHEN it was completed and blessed in 1958, the shrine grotto at Lourdes in Litchfield quickly drew pilgrims to its peaceful, sylvan setting. They lit candles beneath its rocky dome and walked the Stations of the Cross in a wooded hillock that echoed with birdsong and the rushing water of a nearby stream. They roamed its 150 acres but rarely encountered the 40 seminarians who lived in the big house on the hill.</p>
        <p>Last month marked the 40th anniversary of the completion of the grotto -- and the opening of a drive to raise $100,000 to repair and maintain it. Today just three priests live at Lourdes, directing an array of Masses, retreats and programs for 30,000 visitors each year.</p>
        <p>It was the public's embrace of the shrine  that inspired the priests of the Montfort Missionaries to expand their role in the shrine even as their ranks dwindled. A ''church without walls,'' is the way the priests who live there describe Lourdes in Litchfield. They said what people find at the shrine is unconditional acceptance.</p>
        <p>''We live in a very prosperous era,'' said Father Eugene Lynch, who returned to Litchfield in 1997 after working in Africa, South America and the United States. ''That's all very good but there's something else people are looking for. They find it in spirituality.''</p>
        <p>Father Lynch, who is 70, was a seminarian at Lourdes when the grotto was being built. Members of the Montfort order, Brother Alphonso and Brother Gabriel, were brought to Litchfield from Europe to work the farm and raise livestock to provide food for the young seminarians.</p>
        <p>A rock ledge by a stream where the seminarians used to sit and read reminded the Rev. Thomas Kelly, then the rector of Montfort House, of Lourdes, France. The  shrine in the Pyrenees commemorates the place where Roman Catholics believe Mary appeared to a French farm girl named Bernadette. Using a picture postcard of the French shrine as a guide, Father Kelly directed the brothers to build the shrine.  The ledge was dynamited and its rocks affixed in mortar to a mesh foundation. An old bell tower became the curve and arch of the grotto. The statue of Our Lady of Lourdes, placed in a recess in the stones presides over the site. Below is a statue of the kneeling Bernadette.</p>
        <p>It is at once a humble and majestic site; the grotto rising before  simple wooden benches, and the seeming infinity of the surrounding woods and sky. Tucked in the rock behind the tiered candles are folded notes.  ''There are a lot of broken people who come,'' said Father Tom Poth, another of the priests in residence. Word of mouth brought people to the grotto. Slowly,  the number of visitors increased. Still, people were not encouraged to visit the main house where the seminarians studied and prayed, Father Lynch said. ''It was somewhat cloistered,'' he said. ''It was separate from down below.''</p>
        <p>Neither Father Poth nor Father Lynch is sure of how the wall came down between the order that maintains the shrine and the people who visit it. Over time, outdoor Masses were held for the visitors and a gift shop was built in an old shed. In the 1950's, Pilgrim Hall was built as a place to hold services during inclement weather. Volunteers began preparing simple lunches for scheduled visitors. Today, kitchen volunteers say chicken dinners for 40 with a few hours' notice are not uncommon.</p>
        <p>During the pilgrimage season, from May to October, Mass is said at 11:30 A.M. every day but Monday. On Sunday afternoons, there is the Way of the Cross and prayer at the grotto. In addition to celebrating religious feast days, young people, married couples, the sick and disabled or those in recovery from drug or alcohol addiction are recognized in Masses and programs. During the week, there are candlelight rosaries and  planting or clean-up days.</p>
        <p>Volunteers care for the sprawling property, working in the gift shop, maintaining the grounds and and cooking for visitors. A fund drive for the grotto is considered vital.</p>
        <p>''You know the $1 people donate to light a candle?'' asked Father Poth with a laugh.  ''That's how this place survives, on dollar bills.'' He is planning fund-raising events  and hoping for people who might donate their skills or services.</p>
        <p>Father Poth, who is 45 and arrived in Litchfield in 1996, said there is interest in such events as the harvest dinner in October where a Mass is followed by a meal, hayride and bonfire. Last year, a crowd gathered under a star-filled sky for a candle-lit carol sing the Sunday before Christmas. Children  from a local church choir led the singing.  Afterward people gathered in Pilgrim Hall for cookies and hot chocolate.</p>
        <p>As of last year, retreats were organized at the 21-room priests' residence, the Montfort house, on the hill. Somewhat hidden from the grotto, the rambling 1927 house sits at the end of a long, curving drive. With its stone courtyard, leaded windows and dragon head doorknockers, it resembles an English country home, much to its residents' chagrin.</p>
        <p>''We're embarrassed by this building,'' Father Lynch said in a late winter interview. (Father Don LaSalle, the third resident priest, was out that day.) Yet even in the rather grand house visitors find the simplicity they crave, the priests said. A favorite spot is around the table in the large, well-worn kitchen.</p>
        <p>''There is a freedom here,'' said Father Poth. ''It's not institutional and people feel accepted for who they are.''</p>
        <p>The visitors who arrive by bus to see the grotto often hail from poor parishes in the Bronx or Bridgeport. Many visitors are not Catholic; a group of Baptists from an out-of-town parish visits regularly. When Mass is said, the responses are often not in English, said the priests, who are fluent in several languages.</p>
        <p>On a recent Sunday, many of the visitors were from nearby towns. Sal and Virginia Savoia, of Torrington, had brought their 9-year-old granddaughter Casey from Ridgefield.</p>
        <p>Lucy Ricciardone of Litchfield visited with a friend. ''We're so proud to have this shrine,'' she said. ''You feel like you're in heaven when you come here.''</p>
        <p>While they are pleased with the popularity of the shrine, the priests said they are careful to encourage people to become part of their community parish. The shrine is not meant to become a permanent replacement for a church.</p>
        <p>Father Lynch put it this way, ''A place of pilgrimage means to go and be returned.''</p>
