        <p>Your May 31 Week in Review article wrongly uses the Harvard Writing Center, which offers peer tutors in writing, as evidence of Harvard's efforts to remediate underprepared students.</p>
        <p>Like most writing centers at colleges and universities across the country, the Harvard Writing Center offers its services -- one-on-one conversation and guidance aimed at the improvement of writing -- to students of all ability levels.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 31 Week in Review article wrongly uses the Harvard Writing Center, which offers peer tutors in writing, as evidence of Harvard's efforts to remediate underprepared students.</p>
        <p>Like most writing centers at colleges and universities across the country, the Harvard Writing Center offers its services -- one-on-one conversation and guidance aimed at the improvement of writing -- to students of all ability levels.</p>
        <p>Writing centers often help good writers make their work even better. As an instructor at the Harvard Writing Center in the early 1980's, I developed workshops and tutorials for some of the college's best writers -- honors students working on their senior theses.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE  S. COZZENS  Atlanta, June 1, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer directs the Center for Writing and Speaking at Agnes Scott College.</p>
