        <p>THE PROCESS  1,100 Days that Changed the Middle East  By Uri Savir  Illustrated. 336 pages. Random House. $27.95.</p>
        <p>This is the age of diplomacy, when negotiations in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the Middle East have eased or ended violence and changed the world. So it is natural that this also be an age of instant history books, the records of the diplomats. Richard C. Holbrooke has recently published an informative and readable account of his efforts to end the Bosnian war. Now comes Uri Savir, Israel's chief negotiator, with this record of the talks starting in Oslo in 1993 and ending in Taba on the Sinai Peninsula in 1995 with an agreement for Israel to turn most of the occupied West Bank over to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Can George J. Mitchell, the mediator in Northern Ireland, be far behind?</p>
        <p>While we wait for Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Savir has given us plenty to mull over in ''The Process,'' his detailed, balanced, intelligent and in places intensely moving chronicle of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Mr. Savir, who wrote his book in English, has produced a fine piece of diplomatic history. Embedded in his account is also a powerful defense of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, attacked as an act of treason by the Israeli far right and as humiliation and submission by the Palestinian and other Middle East radicals intent on destroying it.</p>

        <p>THE PROCESS  1,100 Days that Changed the Middle East  By Uri Savir  Illustrated. 336 pages. Random House. $27.95.</p>
        <p>This is the age of diplomacy, when negotiations in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the Middle East have eased or ended violence and changed the world. So it is natural that this also be an age of instant history books, the records of the diplomats. Richard C. Holbrooke has recently published an informative and readable account of his efforts to end the Bosnian war. Now comes Uri Savir, Israel's chief negotiator, with this record of the talks starting in Oslo in 1993 and ending in Taba on the Sinai Peninsula in 1995 with an agreement for Israel to turn most of the occupied West Bank over to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Can George J. Mitchell, the mediator in Northern Ireland, be far behind?</p>
        <p>While we wait for Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Savir has given us plenty to mull over in ''The Process,'' his detailed, balanced, intelligent and in places intensely moving chronicle of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Mr. Savir, who wrote his book in English, has produced a fine piece of diplomatic history. Embedded in his account is also a powerful defense of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, attacked as an act of treason by the Israeli far right and as humiliation and submission by the Palestinian and other Middle East radicals intent on destroying it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savir's book is also the record of a friendship with a man who was first introduced to him in Oslo as ''your Enemy No. 1.'' This enemy-turned-friend is Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, Mr. Savir's Palestinian counterpart (and now speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council). In Mr. Savir's portrait of the talks, he and Abu Ala formed a microcosm of the Palestinian-Israeli relationship, or at least a microcosm of that part of it that was able to overcome decades of murderous hostility and produce extraordinary and unexpected scenes of reconciliation.</p>
        <p>Near the end of his book, for example, Mr. Savir describes a meeting led by the Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres (having taken over for the assassinated Yitzhak Rabin), and the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat. Present were other former enemies: senior Israeli Army and security officials and leaders of Palestinian security and intelligence, including several men who had served long terms in Israeli prisons. The meeting was held so that the Palestinian commander, Mohammed Dahlan, speaking in Arabic, could brief the Israelis on ''how his people were systematically fighting terrorism.''</p>
        <p>''We were developing a new routine that signaled a profound change in the nature of our relationships,'' Mr. Savir remarks. Not long after that, while the senior Israelis were celebrating their Independence Day, the Palestinian National Council voted 504 to 54 to nullify the articles in its covenant that called for the destruction of Israel. '' 'Who would ever have thought that we'd be celebrating a P.N.C. decision on Independence Day!' a young colonel standing near me remarked,'' Mr. Savir writes. ''The Palestinian Council's decision that day was, at last, recognition of our independence by the most bitter of former enemies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savir, of course, is well aware of the precariousness of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement and the possibility, especially since Mr. Rabin's assassination in November 1995, that it might not hold. He does not wax sentimental or mawkish in his account, but he does certainly hold to a vision of the Palestinians, and especially of Mr. Arafat, that is sharply different from that of conservative critics of the agreement, both in Israel and among American Jews. Whereas the latter hold to the view that Mr. Arafat has not relinquished the Palestinian dream of destroying Israel, Mr. Savir portrays the Palestinian leaders as sincere in their desire for a workable agreement.</p>
        <p>The descriptions of Mr. Arafat are in this sense among the most gripping in Mr. Savir's account. He depicts Mr. Arafat as volatile, crafty and often touchy but also as a skilled and adaptable negotiator caught between his demands for Palestinian dignity and Israeli demands for guaranteed security. Mr. Arafat could fly into a rage and threaten to terminate the talks, and then, without explanation, make the concession that allowed some halted element in the peace effort to continue.</p>
        <p>At one point, for example, the Palestinians had brought the talks to a stop by demanding that Jewish settlers be removed from the center of Hebron, a move that the Israeli side found politically impossible. This was shortly after an Israeli settler, Baruch Goldstein, had gunned down 31 Arab worshipers inside the Cave of the Patriarchs, an act of barbarism that, among other things, forced the Palestinians to stiffen their resolve on the Hebron issue. When Mr. Savir rather lamely suggested that the Red Cross could serve as an ''international presence'' to help insure Palestinian security, Mr. Arafat exploded. ''Unbelievable!'' he shouted. ''You want to humiliate me, humiliate me!'' But in the end, Mr. Savir says, Mr. Arafat made ''a hard and unpopular decision,'' namely to resume the talks without the removal of the settlers.</p>
        <p>On the Israeli side, Mr. Savir gives Mr. Peres great credit for staying the course, especially in the face of what he saw as unreasonable Israeli hesitation to move forward. On the issue of Hebron for example, Mr. Peres wanted to accede to a Palestinian demand for a police station in the city center. When an Israeli general objected on the ground that the settlers would be angry, Mr. Peres shouted: ''You want 150,000 Hebronites to remain under our control because of 400 Jews? There's a limit to arrogance and a limit to timidity.''</p>
        <p>''The Process'' is often a complicated book, reflecting the complexity and occasionally the dry, technical nature of the negotiations. It ends, necessarily, in uncertainty, with Mr. Savir out of government after the election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996 and the peace effort mired in distrust and obstructionism. But it would be hard to imagine a better or clearer account of how matters got to the present point than the one Mr. Savir provides in this book.</p>
