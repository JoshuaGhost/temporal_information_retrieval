      <abstract>
        <p>Russia, having failed in three previous weekly debt auctions to raise all cash it needs to pay off maturing debt and finance persistent budget deficit, must try to raise $1.2 billion amid near panic among foreign and domestic investors about its ability to maintain value of currency and honor all debts; may be able to sell only part of offering, despite sky-high interest rates and possibility of added International Monetary Fund aid; has been pressing domestic banks and investors to buy bonds as sign of confidence in nation's future; table showing about third of Russia's spending goes to cover interest payments on debt (M)</p>

        <p>Raising the money that it needs each week to pay off debt that is coming due and finance its persistent budget deficit has always been a tricky proposition for Russia, given its tumultuous political and economic climate.</p>
        <p>But the job will be particularly difficult on Wednesday, when the Government needs to raise $1.2 billion from the financial markets in the face of near panic among domestic and foreign investors about Russia's ability to maintain the value of its currency and honor all its debts.</p>
        <p>The Government has failed in three previous weekly debt auctions to raise all the cash that it needs. Economists said it remained unclear whether this auction would fare better.</p>
        <p>Although sky-high interest rates and a possibility of additional aid from the International Monetary Fund have somewhat reassured investors, economists and market analysts said Russia might once again be able to sell only part of the bonds.</p>
        <p>That would force the Government to dip into its skimpy reserves to pay creditors, deepening the sense of crisis.</p>
        <p>The Government has been pressing domestic banks and investors to buy the bonds as a sign of confidence in Russia's prospects. There were some reports today that domestic investors, who are required to place money in escrow with the Government the day before an auction if they want a chance to bid, had made bigger-than-expected deposits, suggesting that demand for the bonds could be better than expected. But analysts said that with the situation so unsettled it was difficult to predict any quick end to the turbulence, especially if foreigners remain wary.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be another volatile day,'' a Russia specialist at Merrill Lynch in London, Dmitry Chernyak, said. ''I don't see a lot of foreign investors returning to the market at this point.''</p>
        <p>Russia's main vehicle for raising money on its domestic financial markets is a bond known as a GKO that matures in less than a year. The country has $60 billion in GKO's outstanding, and because of their relatively short durations the Government is forced into a weekly scramble to redeem them and refinance the debt. Investors demand short maturities to minimize the risks of the ruble's being sharply devalued, eroding the return on the bonds.</p>
        <p>By most estimates up to one-third of the GKO's are held by foreigners, with Russian banks holding most of the rest. The crisis in Asia had made foreigners skittish about investing in developing economies even before Russia's latest woes erupted. And since the Russian stock market began falling and the currency started coming under pressure, foreigners have been pulling their money out of Russia.</p>
        <p>To make ruble-denominated investments more attractive and prop up the currency's value, the Russian central bank has pushed up the short-term annualized interest rates it controls, to 150 percent. The tactic has so far succeeded in maintaining the ruble's value.</p>
        <p>But between the Government-controlled interest rates and the rates set by the market -- including those on the GKO bonds, which are around 65 percent on a yearly basis -- Russia's interest costs threaten to soar out of control. Nearly one-third of the Government's expenditures this year are projected to go to making interest payments. The comparable figure in the United States is 14 percent.</p>
        <p>The projection is based on an assumption that the annualized GKO rates will decline, to 35 percent, economists said.</p>
        <p>''If interest rates remain high, it exacerbates the budget problem and puts them, in effect, in a debt trap,'' said Desmond Lachman, head of emerging market economic research at Salomon Smith Barney, the investment firm in New York. ''It's imperative that they get interest rates down quickly.''</p>
        <p>If rates remain at their current levels for the rest of the year, the budget deficit would be 8 percent of gross domestic product, compared with the 5 percent target agreed to last week by the International Monetary Fund and Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko, according to Erik F. Nielsen, an economist at Goldman Sachs in London.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nielsen, who met on Monday with Mr. Kiriyenko in Moscow as part of a delegation of Western bankers, said Russia planned to try to lessen its dependence on the domestic GKO market by issuing additional bonds denominated in dollars and other currencies through financial markets in Europe. He said Russia was now hoping to raise up to $6 billion this year on the European markets, up from $3.5 billion under a previous plan.</p>
        <p>Russia will need to finance the redemption of $50 billion in debt this year, Mr. Nielsen said.</p>
