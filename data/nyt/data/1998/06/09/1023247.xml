        <p>Jon Pareles Critic's Notebook column on the vitality of the Grateful Dead, which dissolved as a band after death of Jerry Garcia in 1995; notes that band's surviving core has introduced a new band, The Other Ones, reclaiming three decades' worth of Dead songs including ones by Garcia (M)</p>

        <p>For a band that's defunct, the Grateful Dead have been mighty busy lately. In San Francisco on Thursday night, the surviving core of the Dead introduced their new band, the Other Ones, reclaiming three decades' worth of Dead songs including, pointedly, songs by Jerry Garcia, whose death in 1995 put an end to the band. On Friday night, members of the Dead's sound crew were on the QVC cable-television shopping channel, hawking live recordings of the Dead and taking in a quick $70,000. And on Saturday night, the San Jose Stage Company in California gave the premiere of ''Cumberland Blues,'' a musical built around early-1970's songs by Garcia and Robert Hunter, the band's best lyricist.</p>
        <p>It's rock as repertory: a recognition that songs are now assets as well as anthems. They can outlast their original moment by years and decades. As musicians grow long in the tooth, their best songs stay vivid and mobile, still ready to reach far-flung audiences. The tricky part, for musicians who care about the songs as well as the profits, is to keep an eye on the context.</p>

        <p>For a band that's defunct, the Grateful Dead have been mighty busy lately. In San Francisco on Thursday night, the surviving core of the Dead introduced their new band, the Other Ones, reclaiming three decades' worth of Dead songs including, pointedly, songs by Jerry Garcia, whose death in 1995 put an end to the band. On Friday night, members of the Dead's sound crew were on the QVC cable-television shopping channel, hawking live recordings of the Dead and taking in a quick $70,000. And on Saturday night, the San Jose Stage Company in California gave the premiere of ''Cumberland Blues,'' a musical built around early-1970's songs by Garcia and Robert Hunter, the band's best lyricist.</p>
        <p>It's rock as repertory: a recognition that songs are now assets as well as anthems. They can outlast their original moment by years and decades. As musicians grow long in the tooth, their best songs stay vivid and mobile, still ready to reach far-flung audiences. The tricky part, for musicians who care about the songs as well as the profits, is to keep an eye on the context.</p>
        <p>The Dead have been careful. None of the material they recorded has been made available for commercials. Of course, they're not hurting for cash; Grateful Dead Merchandising, selling everything from concert recordings to logo-embroidered denim shirts, took in $14 million last year. And the group has accepted its status as an institution: a $50 million Grateful Dead museum, to be called Terrapin Station, will probably settle on a site this fall.</p>
        <p>In an institution, history can outweigh the present. While nearly every touring band keeps favorite songs in the set list, some bands have turned into repertory groups playing not just oldies but full-length albums. The Who has toured with a concert version of its 1973 album ''Quadrophenia''; Cheap Trick, harking back to its 1970's heyday, performed all the songs from its 1979 album ''Live at Budokan'' last month and plans to return Oct. 29 through 31 with three shows at Tramps devoted to its first three albums. The message is that longtime fans are connoisseurs whose appreciation extends beyond mere hits. It's also a grudging recognition that for most rock songwriters, experience and craftsmanship pale next to the inspirations of youth.</p>
        <p>Then there's the theater option; as rock fans age, they don't mind sitting down for decorous entertainment. Rock songwriters are no strangers to theater productions, from revues like the Lieber and Stoller anthology ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'' to full-scale rock operas like ''Tommy.'' ''Cumberland Blues'' was authorized but not initiated by the Dead (unlike ''Tommy,'' which had Pete Townshend's full involvement). In the early 1970's, the Dead put psychedelia on hold and returned to songs steeped in country, bluegrass and blues; the San Jose company got the idea that the tales of backwoods and frontier life that Mr. Hunter's lyrics conjured could be turned into a coherent story.</p>
        <p>The playwright Michael Norman Mann listened hard to the songs, and like someone working out a narrative crossword puzzle, he connected characters' names and recurring images of hard work, gambling, drinking, death and redemption. He came up with a backwoods family story: a gambler, a miner, a preacher (for the redemption angle) and good and bad women. It's ingenious and good-natured but thick with cliches: ''You just want what you can't have, and you always did.'' Yet the tunes are sure-fire. There are in-jokes for Dead Heads, and the staging of songs like ''Deal'' and ''Bertha'' brings out their theatricality. If Cole Porter songs can be strung together for the stage, so can Garcia-Hunter songs.</p>
        <p>Still, the Dead's members aren't all ready to sit back and savor the royalties. Although Bill Kreutzmann, the original drummer, has retired, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Mickey Hart are heading back on the road as the Other Ones, headlining this summer's Furthur Festival with two guitarists and a saxophonist in Garcia's place, as well as Bruce Hornsby on keyboards and a new drummer.</p>
        <p>The Dead became an institution by touring constantly, reinventing (and sometimes mangling) the repertory every night. Durable as the songs are, they need to be played and played with. The Other Ones may be looking back at a proud legacy, and the guitarists in particular are working in a style that has been handed down to them. But their job is to keep the songs alive and wayward in the present, and their first show promised that they won't spend too much time looking back.</p>
