        <p>When Giants linebacker Corey Miller agreed to take a pay cut last week to stay with the team, he talked with Coach Jim Fassel, and according to the coach, promised to be at Giants Stadium this week for the  passing-camp workouts.</p>
        <p>But Miller did not make an appearance at Giants Stadium today, an absence that clearly left Fassel miffed, although Raymond Anderson, Miller's agent, told the team that Miller left his South Carolina home early this morning, apparently heading for New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''He usually flies up here, but maybe he's driving this time,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said of Miller, whose $1.5 million salary was slashed by $600,000.</p>
        <p>''He told me he'd be here, and he's not,'' Fassel said. Asked whether he was angered by Miller's absence, Fassel said to reporters, ''You guys can draw your own conclusions.''</p>
        <p>Fassel then recited the names of a few players who had been given excused absences from today's workout. ''They all talked to me about why they wouldn't be here,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>The Giants' workouts this month are technically optional, but players customarily tell teams of any absence, anyway. Fassel gave Miller last week off from the workouts. ''He said he had some things to take care of, and I said that was O.K.,'' Fassel said. ''I'll visit with him about that. I always give the guy the benefit of the doubt until I talk to him.''</p>
        <p>Miller may be on the verge of losing his starting job at strongside linebacker. Some Giants coaches are leaning toward giving that starting assignment to Marcus Buckley, whom the team signed to a three-year free agent contract this winter.</p>
        <p>If Miller is upset over his pay cut, it will surprise Accorsi. The Giants' general manager said that Miller signed his new contract and mailed it to the team last week. ''There were no problems,'' Accorsi said.</p>
