        <p>BLACK pasta, tinted with the ink of cuttlefish, is stunning to serve. (Cuttlefish have larger ink sacs than squid.) And the delicate marine flavor the ink imparts makes it especially good in summer either hot, with a slightly spicy tomato sauce, or tossed with artichokes and shrimp in a vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Many purveyors of fresh pasta offer the black variety. It is also sold dried. Cuttlefish ink is sold in some specialty shops, so making the pasta from scratch is not a challenge. But the results are wildly impressive all the same.</p>

        <p>BLACK pasta, tinted with the ink of cuttlefish, is stunning to serve. (Cuttlefish have larger ink sacs than squid.) And the delicate marine flavor the ink imparts makes it especially good in summer either hot, with a slightly spicy tomato sauce, or tossed with artichokes and shrimp in a vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Many purveyors of fresh pasta offer the black variety. It is also sold dried. Cuttlefish ink is sold in some specialty shops, so making the pasta from scratch is not a challenge. But the results are wildly impressive all the same.</p>
        <p>Black Pasta With Spicy Tomatoes  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>4large cloves garlic</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon crushed red peppers, or to taste</p>
        <p>1pound ripe plum tomatoes, chopped</p>
        <p>A 14-ounce can Italian plum tomatoes, well-drained and chopped</p>
        <p>Salt</p>
        <p>1pound fresh black linguine, purchased or homemade (recipe follows)</p>
        <p>2tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Heat three tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet. Add the garlic and peppers, saute for a few seconds, then add all the tomatoes. Adjust heat to medium and simmer about 15 minutes, until the sauce has somewhat thickened. Season to taste with salt. Remove from heat and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.</p>
        <p>2. While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the linguine. As soon as the sauce has finished cooking, add the linguine to the water and cook about five minutes, until al dente. Drain thoroughly.</p>
        <p>3. Put the pasta in the skillet, toss with the sauce and serve, sprinkled with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Black Pasta Salad With Shrimp and Artichokes  Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1lemon, halved</p>
        <p>4large artichokes</p>
        <p>1/2cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>1/4pound small fresh green beans, trimmed</p>
        <p>1pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</p>
        <p>3tablespoons Dijon mustard</p>
        <p>1/4cup white-wine vinegar</p>
        <p>1/2cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1pound black fettuccine, purchased or homemade (recipe follows)</p>
        <p>Italian parsley leaves for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Squeeze the lemon halves into a saucepan and add two cups of water. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Trim each artichoke of all leaves and stem and remove the fuzzy choke, leaving only the fleshy bottom. Slice the bottom vertically one-fourth of an inch thick and place in lemon water to prevent discoloring.</p>
        <p>3. Add the wine to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook gently until the artichokes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the beans and cook about five minutes longer, until they are crisp-tender. Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon. Add the shrimp to the liquid and cook about a minute, just until they turn pink. Drain.</p>
        <p>4. Beat the mustard and vinegar together. Slowly beat in the olive oil. Season this dressing with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>5. Toss the shrimp with the artichokes and beans. Moisten with about a third of the dressing and set aside.</p>
        <p>6. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, cook the fettuccine four to six minutes, until just tender, drain well, rinse under cold water and drain thoroughly.</p>
        <p>7. Toss the pasta with the remaining dressing. Divide the pasta among six plates. Top each portion with some of the shrimp and vegetable mixture and garnish with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Black Pasta  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>2cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>Pinch of salt</p>
        <p>2large eggs</p>
        <p>1teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1ounce (2 tablespoons) squid or cuttlefish ink</p>
        <p>1to 3 teaspoons water</p>
        <p>Cornmeal.</p>
        <p>1. Combine flour and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Mix the eggs, oil and squid ink together. With the machine running, add them through the feed tube. Add as much of the water as needed to form a ball of dough.</p>
        <p>2. Pass the dough through increasingly fine settings of a pasta maker to form thin, smooth sheets of dough. For linguine, cut the sheets into thin strands by hand or by using the cutting blade of the pasta machine. For fettuccine, cut the pasta in half-inch widths.</p>
        <p>3. If not using at once, toss with cornmeal and refrigerate or allow to dry completely at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 pound.</p>
