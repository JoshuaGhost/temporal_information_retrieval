        <p>The United States had been eliminated, 1-0, by Brazil from the 1994 World Cup, and when the Americans returned to their team hotel in southern California, forward Eric Wynalda found himself talking to the assistant coach Steve Sampson at poolside.</p>
        <p>''What are you going to do now?'' Wynalda asked Sampson.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea,'' Sampson replied.</p>
        <p>No one, least of all Sampson, thought he would be head coach of the Americans for the 1998 World Cup in France. For one thing, no American-born coach had ever led the United States into the final round of soccer's world championship. For another, Sampson had never played professionally or coached a professional club team.</p>
        <p>''I knew his ambition one day was to be the national team coach,'' said Alan I. Rothenberg, president of the United States Soccer Federation. ''I held out hope for him in the future, but the much more distant future.''</p>
        <p>But a harmonic convergence of improbable events has landed Sampson exactly where no one thought he would be -- coaching the Americans in the World Cup as they prepare for first-round matches against Germany in Paris on June 15; against Iran in Lyons on June 21 and against Yugoslavia in Nantes on June 25.</p>
        <p>As one of the three youngest coaches at the World Cup, and as the first American-born coach given this opportunity, Sampson, 41, has employed an assertive style on offense and a new overall formation to take advantage of strength in the midfield. He has also made the bold, controversial decision to remove John Harkes, the former team captain, from the World Cup squad and to bench such mainstays on defense as Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa.</p>
        <p>He has remade the team according to his own design, and his future will be largely determined by whether his players adhere to his daring blueprint.</p>
        <p>Since Sampson became coach on an interim basis in 1995, the United States has collected some of its most important victories, defeating such world powers as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Unlike many international coaches, who have little formal education, Sampson holds a master's degree in education, and his skill at communicating with his players has set him distinctly apart from his successful, but enigmatic, predecessor, Bora Milutinovic.</p>
        <p>Milutinovic, a Serb who is now coaching Nigeria, his fourth team in the World Cup, played a defensive style that seemed to fit the Americans in 1994, many of whom were inexperienced in the international game. Instinct was Milutinovic's strength, not communication. He kept his own players, even his assistant coaches, in the dark about his plans. ''My friend,'' he would tell them, ''if you know me you will have no trouble following me.''</p>
        <p>Success for Milutinovic meant not conceding goals. Players did not dare challenge his decisions, lest they be removed from the team. The United States advanced to the second round, but it played not to lose instead of to win. Brazil defeated the Americans in 1994 even though it played the second half a man down after Leonardo was ejected for elbowing Tab Ramos in the head. Four years later, Sampson has given the team a more open and ambitious system, one designed to produce goals and a firm understanding of each player's role.</p>
        <p>''Steve allows his players to express their opinions,'' Wynalda said. ''And we're playing to win instead of not to lose. If we played Brazil again with 10 men in the World Cup, we would win, no doubt.''</p>
        <p>Daily, Sampson makes it a point to speak with at least three of his players in private conversation. Every player gets a private chat once a week.</p>
        <p>''Not that I minded that Bora wasn't an American, but Steve can relate to players easier,'' midfielder Claudio Reyna said. ''He knows we want to go forward and have fun playing the game.''</p>
        <p>Sampson's impeccable scouting report played a significant role in the Americans' surprise 2-1 victory over Colombia in the 1994 World Cup. He speaks fluent Spanish, which he has used to court the large Hispanic-American constituency in soccer and to better understand the politics and psyches of regional soccer opponents in Central and South America. In anticipation of the World Cup match with Iran, Sampson has a Farsi-speaking aide combing Iranian Web sites and chat rooms on the Internet, hoping to gain the slightest psychological and tactical edge.</p>
        <p>''Speaking Spanish, I can now find out what makes a national team click anywhere in the Hispanic-speaking world,'' said Sampson, who lives in Agoura Hills, Calif., with his wife, Sheri, and three children. ''I know the pressures put on players and teams and that some handle pressure different than others. I need to do the same thing with Germany and Iran. Understanding their culture and what makes them tick will have a lot to do with how well we respond.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Politics, culture, religion all play a part in the makeup of the Iranian team. Anyone who doesn't think those are connected is naive. It's more important for them to beat us than to get to the second round, in my opinion. This is more than just sport. This is the identity of a country that is trying to make its place among what are considered the best nations in the world.''</p>
        <p>Sampson was born in Salt Lake City and moved with his family to the Bay Area in northern California at age 2. He began playing soccer at age 6, and played collegiately at San Jose State and at U.C.L.A. But he tore cartilage in his knee, and the North American Soccer League was not exactly handing out rich contracts to Americans who lacked speed and had retread wheels. If Sampson wanted to remain in the game, he would have to coach.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, he was ambitious. In 1981-82, while he obtained his master's degree from Stanford, Sampson simultaneously coached four amateur teams and played semipro soccer. Coaching the national team was a pipe dream, not a real pursuit. He left Stanford $20,000 in debt and took an assistant coaching job at U.C.L.A., sleeping on a friend's sofa for a year and a half. All of his possessions fit in three drawers.</p>
        <p>To supplement his income, Sampson became head of U.C.L.A.'s athletic department tutoring service. He even designed the basketball locker room at Pauley Pavilion. But what he really wanted to be was a head coach in soccer. In 1986, Santa Clara came calling; expectations were nothing higher than an occasional conference title. In his first month on the job, Sampson filed a five-year plan for winning a national championship. In his fourth year, he delivered.</p>
        <p>Still, there was nothing to suggest that he would soon be coaching the United States in the World Cup any time soon. For the 1994 World Cup, Sampson was hired as a member of the organizing committee, not the coaching staff. But the business end of soccer was something with which he was neither happy nor successful. And in 1993, when Milutinovic wanted to hire a Serbian assistant coach, Rothenberg said, ''First, you must hire an American.'' Sampson happily took the elevator from the front office down to field level.</p>
        <p>Coaching jobs in soccer are about as stable as the Russian economy. Milutinovic was fired in 1995, but Sampson was not the first choice as his replacement. Or the second choice. Rothenberg did not believe any American was experienced enough to coach on the international level. So he offered the job to Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title. Then he offered it to Carlos Quieroz of Portugal. Only when they turned it down did Rothenberg offer the job to Sampson.</p>
        <p>The catch was, it was an interim designation. It was Sampson's first turn as a professional head coach. The only way to keep his job was to win and to win immediately. Stunningly, he did. Freed from the defensive moorings of Milutinovic, Sampson's team played jubilantly in the summer of 1995, defeating Nigeria, Argentina, Chile and Mexico twice. By August of that year, the word ''interim'' was dropped.</p>
        <p>His job seemed in jeopardy as the Americans played fitfully during qualifying games for the 1998 World Cup, but a 0-0 draw in Mexico City, achieved despite being a man down for 58 minutes, solidified Sampson's position last November. A 3-0 victory over Canada a week later made him the first American-born coach to qualify the United States for soccer's world championship. Rothenberg extended Sampson's contract through the World Cup.</p>
        <p>''If there is a burden on my shoulders, it is that I truly want to be successful for the image of American coaches,'' Sampson said. ''For so long, American coaches were excluded from this kind of opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Secure for the moment, Sampson set out to remake his team. ''It's difficult to make bold decisions when they're questioning whether you're going to be the coach or not,'' Sampson said. His most intrepid, and controversial, decision was to remove Harkes who, in Sampson's eyes, lacked a willingness to play defense and was a disciplinary problem. The move is not popular with all of Harkes's former teammates. ''He's a good person and a great player who should be here,'' Lalas said. But Sampson said he is losing no sleep over the decision.</p>
        <p>''I want to be known as a coach who bases his decisions on principle,'' Sampson said. ''Certain things cannot be allowed, no matter how good a player you are.''</p>
        <p>He has also sent Lalas, the most recognizable American player, and Balboa, the most experienced in an American uniform, to the bench in a new 3-6-1 system that features three defenders, six midfielders and one forward. And he was not hesitant to bring in the French defender David Regis, who received his American citizenship in mid-May, replacing others who had worked hard to help the team qualify for one, and in some cases, two World Cups.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it my job to put the best American team on the field?'' Sampson said.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, soccer has gained in visibility in the United States to the point that Sampson said he will be recognized by several  people if he walks through a mall. Of course, some of them confuse him with the golfers Nick Faldo and Peter Jacobson. Once, while waiting for his bags in Los Angeles International Airport, a man approached Sampson and said, ''You had a great tournament last weekend.''</p>
        <p>American success (advancing to the second round) or failure in the World Cup will determine whether Sampson is invited to continue coaching the national team. If not, he would most likely look to coach a national team in Central or South America.</p>
        <p>''How well he does is totally in his and his team's hands,'' Rothenberg said. ''I hope he continues to be as good, and/or as lucky, as he's been all along.''</p>
