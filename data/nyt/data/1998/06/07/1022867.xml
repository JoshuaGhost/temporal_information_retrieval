        <p>''Why Microsoft Should Be Left Alone'' (Viewpoint, May 24), by Bhaskar Chakravorti, drew varied responses from readers. Mr. Chakravorti, a senior member of the global consulting practice of the Monitor Company in Cambridge, Mass., argued that technology markets require no more regulatory intervention than other markets -- and that Microsoft has endured not by crushing competition but by finding ways to make challengers' products its own. Some readers essentially agreed; some saw other issues at work in Microsoft's fight with the Government.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have had mixed feelings toward the Microsoft standard because I was the happy user of the Appleworks software with Apple IIe's, predecessor to the Macintosh. I initially fought the change to Windows, but now that I have learned the mindset, I actually find it user-friendly. (The problem was it took me three years to get to that point.)</p>
        <p>Now that Microsoft is successful enough to have created an industry standard for 90 percent of computer users, why is the Department of Justice intruding itself? What concerns me is the department's inability to comprehend the need for uniformity in the software standard so that computer users can communicate effortlessly. Why doesn't the capitalist spirit of America allow for the success of Microsoft's efforts to have all of us reading from the same page? Microsoft shouldn't be punished for getting it right.</p>
