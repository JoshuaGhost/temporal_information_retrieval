        <p>A doughnut and a restaurant chain made changes on their accounts yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Dunkin' Donuts unit of Allied Domecq in Randolph, Mass., named Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston to handle its account, with billings estimated at $45 million. The account had been handled since October 1995 by Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG in New York, a unit of Havas Advertising, until that agency was dismissed last month.</p>
        <p>Hill, Holliday, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, was awarded the account after a monthlong review that also included one other agency: Deutsch Inc. in New York; Deutsch's Santa Monica, Calif., office handles advertising for the Baskin-Robbins unit of Allied Domecq.</p>
        <p>And Outback Steakhouse Inc. in Tampa, Fla., named TBWA Chiat/ Day in New York to handle the creative portion of its account, with billings estimated to be as much as $35 million. The account had been handled by the McCann-Erickson New York unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group of the Interpublic Group of Companies, until that agency and Outback parted ways in December.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a two-month review that included TBWA Chiat/Day, part of Omnicom Group, and Ground Zero in Santa Monica, Calif., and Partners &amp; Shevack in New York, part of Mickelberry Communications. KSL Media Inc. and SFM Media Corporation, both of New York, handle the media portion of the account.</p>
