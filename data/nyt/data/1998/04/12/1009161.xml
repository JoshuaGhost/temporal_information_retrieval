        <p>SPICES can blast with both barrels or they can subtly lift a dish to a higher level of flavorful complexity. It is just a matter of how they are used.</p>
        <p>Hot red peppers, curry powder and cumin are often among the ingredients in recipes these days. Ideally, they make the mouth glow with delight but do not terrify the palate with some macho assault.</p>
        <p>Here are three seafood recipes that benefit from spice. In each instance, there is another ingredient, like cream, yogurt or oil, to temper the potential blowtorch. Feel free to adjust the degree of spice, if you wish, but remember to do so in small increments so the dish does not go over the line.</p>
        <p>The result should be a richness that would be impossible without the spice.</p>
        <p>Creamy Spiced Mussels  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/4cup finely chopped shallots</p>
        <p>1pound ripe plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>3/4cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>2pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</p>
        <p>1/2cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>Salt to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Heat the oil in a heavy three-quart saucepan. Add the shallots and saute until they start to brown. Stir in the tomatoes and continue cooking until they soften. Stir in the wine.</p>
        <p>2. Add the mussels, cover and cook until they open, about eight minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the mussels to each of four warm soup plates. Add the pepper flakes and cream to the cooking liquid in the pan and bring to a boil. Season to taste with salt. Pour over each portion of mussels and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Spiced Lobster Salad  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>10ounces cooked lobster, preferably tail meat</p>
        <p>1tablespoon finely diced red onion</p>
        <p>1tablespoon minced fresh mint leaves</p>
        <p>1tablespoon minced fresh cilantro leaves</p>
        <p>1medium-size seedless English cucumber</p>
        <p>4ounces plain yogurt</p>
        <p>1teaspoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>3tablespoons fresh lemon juice</p>
        <p>1tablespoon finely grated lemon zest</p>
        <p>Salt to taste</p>
        <p>Mint sprigs for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Dice the lobster, put it in a bowl and fold in the onion and minced mint and cilantro. Cover and refrigerate.</p>
        <p>2. Peel and dice half the cucumber, put it in a bowl and add the yogurt, cumin, lemon juice and lemon zest. Combine the lobster mixture with the yogurt dressing. Season with a pinch or two of salt.</p>
        <p>4. Peel the remaining cucumber and slice it into thin rounds. Arrange the rounds in a circle on each of four salad plates. Spoon a mound of the lobster salad in the center of each, garnish with mint and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Flounder In Curried Escabeche  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>3tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>2teaspoons curry powder, or to taste</p>
        <p>6small flounder fillets, about 1 pound</p>
        <p>6tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1medium onion, sliced thin</p>
        <p>1small red bell pepper, cored and sliced thin</p>
        <p>1/2fennel bulb, sliced thin</p>
        <p>1large clove garlic</p>
        <p>1/4cup fish stock or water</p>
        <p>4tablespoons fresh lemon juice</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro.</p>
        <p>1. Combine the flour and a teaspoon and a half of curry powder on a dinner plate. Dip the flounder in this mixture to coat each side.</p>
        <p>2. Heat three tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick. Saute the flounder a few minutes on each side, until lightly browned and cooked through. Transfer the flounder to a serving platter.</p>
        <p>3. Lower the heat under the skillet and add the onion, pepper, fennel and garlic. Saute slowly until the vegetables are tender and lightly browned. Stir in the remaining curry powder, adjusting the amount to taste, and deglaze with the fish stock and lemon juice.</p>
        <p>4. Remove from heat and add the remaining olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture over the fish and garnish with cilantro. This dish can be served immediately or can be set aside at room temperature about an hour before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 appetizer servings.</p>
