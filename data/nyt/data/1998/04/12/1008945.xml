Howie was a graduate of NMB Senior High, George Washington University, St. Thomas University School of Law, Georgetown University Law Center and an alumnus of his much loved Camp Wayne. He was an associate at the law firm of Broad &amp; Cassel and a member of the Florida and DC Bars. His life was short but sweet. He was a kind, compassionate, funny, loving and bright man.

May you be granted the strength to face this trying time and may you rejoice in the wonderful memories of his life. Stephen, Linda, Lisa, and Jason</p>
        <p>ROBINSON-Howard. Never before has a kid from Florida touched the lives of so many New Yorkers. There is a huge cloud over Camp Wayne. Our loving thoughts are with Jeff, Harriet, and Joanie. The Groothuis Family</p>
        <p>ROBINSON-Howard. To our dear friend, fellow board member and mentor, we extend our heartfelt sympathy to both Harriet and Jeff on the untimely loss of their son, Howie. The Board of Directors Netspeak Corporation</p>
