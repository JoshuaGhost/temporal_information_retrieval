        <p>ONE of the most interesting and entertaining cars I have driven lately is one you cannot buy in the United States: the Ford Puma.</p>
        <p>Ford began selling the small and very sporty coupe in Europe a year ago. At a price of just over $18,000, the German-made car is aimed at European auto enthusiasts on a modest budget.</p>
        <p>The Puma's appeal, and its fun, begin with its styling. A prime example of Ford's New Edge design, the Puma has pronounced lines and a short back end that gives the car a swoopy, speedy look.</p>
        <p>Inside, the large gauges have black numbers on white dials. Brushed aluminum is used as accents -- on the shift knob, on the door, around the gauges and across the center of the instrument panel.</p>
        <p>In a weeklong test drive in Michigan, the Puma grabbed attention everywhere it went, prompting questions from the teller at my bank's drive-through window, getting stares from hairdressers through the win dows of the beauty shop, and inspiring a couple of 20-something guys in a pickup to pull alongside, signal me to roll down the window and ask about the car.</p>
        <p>The Puma's performance neatly meshes with its fun appearance. Its very direct steering responds immediately to the slightest movement of the wheel, reminding me of a go-cart I drove as a child. The Puma is not simply agile, it moves with razor-sharp precision, tempting an ordinarily reticent driver to dart in and out of traffic. Its five-speed shifter has extremely short throws between gears for quick shifting. The Puma zips away from stoplights thanks to its lightweight 1.7-liter, four-cylinder engine, and the brakes are decisive.</p>
        <p>The comfortable, body-hugging seats held me in place through quick maneuvers. I found the firm ride comfortable, although I suspect it is too stiff for most Americans.</p>
        <p>The Puma shares its front-drive architecture with the Ford Fiesta and Ka, both of which are also sold only in Europe. Sharing a platform makes it easier and more cost-effective for Ford to create fun niche models like the Puma. Still, the economies of scale may not be enough to prompt Ford to import the Puma to the United States. The American market for sporty coupes has collapsed, and the car would have to be reworked to meet safety and emissions standards. That's too bad, for this is one enjoyable car.</p>
