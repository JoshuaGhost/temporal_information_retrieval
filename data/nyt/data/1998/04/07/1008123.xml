        <p>Emily Rosa, whose experiments rebuffed the claims of alternative medicine to cure without touching (front page, April 1), follows a distinguished predecessor, Benjamin Franklin. In the late 1770's, Dr. Friedrich Anton Mesmer believed that he had discovered an ability to manipulate the new-found forces of electric and magnetic fields in the body for cures at a distance. His ability to throw Parisian ladies into swoons was a top draw at society soirees.</p>
        <p>Franklin, then in Paris, helped lead a scientific investigative panel. He,  too, used a barrier: a door with Mesmer supposedly behind it.</p>
        <p>The sensitive ladies had their fits just as well with no Mesmer behind the door -- so long as they believed he was there. Animal magnetism as a long-distance force field went to the scrapheap of science, while Mesmer's face-to-face powers of suggestion helped inspire hypnotism (''mesmerism'').</p>
