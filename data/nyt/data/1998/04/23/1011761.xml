        <p>''I believe that we need to hear from the taxpayers before we sink a billion dollars into a new stadium in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, proposing to put a referendum about a new ballpark on the ballot.</p>
        <p>''That's sort of the absence of leadership. I got elected to be a leader, not a panderer.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, dismissing the idea.</p>
        <p>ANNOUNCER NO. 1: It's great to be here, isn't it Joe?</p>
        <p>Announcer No. 2: Sure is.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Historic moment. And what a day it is! The sun is shining. The fans are cheering. And the new stadium, it just looks terrific. Words don't do it justice.</p>
        <p>No. 2: It's been a long, uneven road to get here, hasn't it, Bob?</p>
        <p>No. 1: Well, yes, there have been ups and downs, no two ways about it. But it all seems worth it this sparkling afternoon, here at the I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter Stadium.</p>
        <p>No. 2: It's really a shame, Bob, Rudy Giuliani couldn't be here to throw the first pitch.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Yup, Joe, the former Mayor sure would have enjoyed this. He certainly deserved it.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Yeah, no one else believed it was possible. I mean, putting a huge 60,000-seat stadium with 15,000 parking spaces smack dab in the middle of one of the most expensive and congested urban areas in the world? Must have sounded crazy at the time.</p>
        <p>No. 1: He certainly was a dreamer.</p>
        <p>No. 2: A visionary.</p>
        <p>No. 1: A leader.</p>
        <p>No. 2: What was his famous line again: ''Bronx, Schmonx?''</p>
        <p>No. 1: Nothing stood in his way.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Nope.</p>
        <p>No. 1: And how do the new New York-MCI Yankees look, Joe?</p>
        <p>No. 2: Just terrific, Bob.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Those pinstripes -- you know, I don't miss them a bit.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Me, either. The Swoosh, I mean it's great!</p>
        <p>No. 1: It's amazing, isn't it, how the team's gotten back together after all the lawsuits and the injunctions? Who could tell they haven't played for the last 30 years, waiting for the courts to settle things?</p>
        <p>No. 2: Those West Siders!</p>
        <p>No. 1: Incredible how they held on.</p>
        <p>No. 2: And the environmentalists!</p>
        <p>No. 1: Geez!</p>
        <p>No. 2: You can just imagine how excited the fans are. Think of it, the Yankees playing ball again!</p>
        <p>No. 1: And the really great thing is the stadium, which by the time it was finished ran to, what, $5 billion ----</p>
        <p>No. 2: Seven if you count the legal fees.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Seven billion ----</p>
        <p>No. 2: Well, nine, really, when you add in the rerouting of the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Nine billion, and the whole thing didn't cost taxpayers a single penny.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Who'd have guessed you could squeeze so much money out of the New York City school budget?</p>
        <p>No. 1: That took thinking big.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Leadership.</p>
        <p>No. 1: And what about those skyboxes! State of the art.</p>
        <p>No. 2 The helipad's really working out well, too, I hear.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Too bad about some of the backups on the West Side Highway. There's a bit of a mess, too, I hear, in midtown, what with the gridlock and all. But what can you expect opening day?</p>
        <p>No. 2: How long did that guy say it took to get in from the Island?</p>
        <p>No. 1: He must have been exaggerating. Hell, you could crawl in faster than that.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Certainly a great view from up here.</p>
        <p>No. 1: Yes, and it should be a great game.</p>
        <p>No. 2: A great game in a great city. We should be starting any moment now, so stay with us for this historic broadcast. In just a few minutes we will be bringing you the singing of the National Anthem and the Pepsi jingle. Then it's game time!</p>
        <p>No. 1: Rudy Giuliani, if you can hear us, this one's for you.</p>
        <p>No. 2: Yes, hats off to you, Rudy, wherever you are. Meanwhile, stay tuned, MCI-Yankee fans. We'll be back in just a moment to play McBall!</p>
