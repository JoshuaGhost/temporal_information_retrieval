        <p>HOP on the seat and try to follow in the exact pedal strokes of the champion cyclist Greg LeMond, whizzing up the Champs-Elysees to win the 1989 Tour de France. Or feel the resistance while pedaling the hills of Central Park or the Kona Ironman triathlon course, then bask in the virtual sunshine of the dry hills around San Luis Obispo.</p>
        <p>All you need is a bike, a television, a computer (Pentium PC with graphics card) (www.computrainer. com/index.html) and a Computrainer, a frame with rollers and electronic sensors that links all of the above to give indoor athletes the feel of the hills and pacing of dozens of bike race courses around the world. Some people forgo the television, choosing to watch smaller video views of sprinting cyclists on their computer monitors.</p>
        <p>Some people, of course, forgo it all and ride bicycles outside.</p>
        <p>The trainer, which sells for $1,099 ($1,249 for the 3-D version released in early April), is manufactured by Racermate of Seattle, a soggy city with dark winters that has held indoor triathlons featuring rowing machines, treadmills and Computrainers.</p>
        <p>Professional racers make up 80 percent of Computrainer's market. They use it to plot out the optimal spots on the courses for shifting gears, drinking and eating.</p>
        <p>''It has taken me from the middle of the pack to the front of the pack,'' said Jim Donaldson of Toledo, Ohio, who said he had been a mediocre triathlete when he bought his Computrainer in 1991 but qualified for the Iron Man Triathlon the next year. He occasionally sells Computrainers as a sideline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson went modem-racing with a friend in another city recently. With their computers connected by phone, they raced for 30 miles in virtual Columbia, Md., a course of steep grades. Racing via the Internet will be available soon, company officials say.</p>
        <p>Regardless of reality -- it was raining that night in Toledo, a city he says is without hills -- Mr. Donaldson had an ''exciting ride,'' he said. He spends up to two hours on Computrainers. Riders training for 100-mile races have pedaled on the machine for six or seven hours, showing an capacity for sweat and boredom that would almost certainly be impossible without the distractions of changing courses and scenery.</p>
        <p>U.S.A. Cycling, a nonprofit group in Colorado Springs that oversees that selection of international competitors, has used the Computrainer to screen athletes. It has some limitations, said Mike Niederpruem, the group's manager of coaching programs. ''It requires electricity so it's difficult to take with you for warming up prior to an event,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Racermate company guarantees a 5 percent improvement in performance in three months, though most riders see two or three times that improvement, said Chuck Wurster, vice president of marketing for Racermate, a subsidiary of the Flo scan Instrument Company.</p>
        <p>The 2-D version is less engaging visually than the 3-D but offers an electronic pedal stroke analysis, showing riders what parts of their stroke need to be more forceful to get the most even and efficient motion.</p>
        <p>The 3-D version uses a graphics accelerator. Bikers can draft behind a chrome pacer rider; a female cyclist was fairly realistic, down to her swinging ponytail. More scenery packs are planned, which is a good thing, as it is a bit disconcerting to see California grassland while pedaling in Manhattan.</p>
