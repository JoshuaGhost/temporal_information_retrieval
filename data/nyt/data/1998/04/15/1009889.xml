        <p>Residents of the Bronx and elected officials there have long complained that whatever media attention the borough gets tends to focus on crime. Now a cable television operator says it will show that there is plenty of other news in the borough -- enough to warrant round-the-clock coverage.</p>
        <p>In about two months, News 12, which is owned by Rainbow Media Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of Cablevision, will begin broadcasting news reports from the Bronx 24 hours a day, Joshua W. Sapan, president and chief executive officer of Rainbow Media, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Bronx, with 250,000 Cablevision subscribers, has the greatest concentration of subscribers in New York City, which is part of the reason that Cablevision has decided to offer the 24-hour news channel there, Mr. Sapan said. ''If it were not located in New York City, the Bronx would command tremendous attention,'' he said. ''It's the seventh-most ethnically diverse county in the United States. It's quintessentially American. It's got Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Zoo and the Botanical Garden.''</p>
        <p>Clint Roswell, a spokesman for Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, said the cable station would turn the spotlight on news other than crime, which has dogged the borough of 1.2 million residents for years.</p>
        <p>''We need to hear about retail development in Co-op City, the new housing in Highbridge and the importance of the Jerome Park Reservoir,'' Mr. Roswell said. ''This station will amplify those issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapan said News 12 will open a studio at 930 Soundview Avenue, where there will be about 40 full-time employees. There was no breakdown yesterday of how many of those staff member will be reporters.</p>
        <p>News 12 also plans to collaborate with the Spanish-language newspaper El Diario-La Prensa to produce weekend discussion panels on issues affecting the Bronx's large Hispanic population, he said.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of its 24-hour news station on Long Island in 1986, News 12 paved the way for round-the-clock television news services like Time Warner's five-year-old New York 1 News. News 12 has won four local Emmy awards since its inception, including one in 1991 for its coverage of the crash of Avianca Airlines Flight 52 in Cove Neck in which 73 people died.</p>
        <p>Cablevision, which has about 2.5 million subscribers in the greater New York area, currently broadcasts 24-hour news channels on Long Island and in Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The company is considering offering 24-hour news programming in Brooklyn, where there are about 240,000 Cablevision subscribers, but no decision has been made, Mr. Sapan said.</p>
