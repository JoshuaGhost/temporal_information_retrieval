        <p>Paulo Ribeiro takes on the large and amorphous topic of human good and evil in ''Blue Emerald,'' presented by the Paulo Ribeiro Dance Company on Friday night at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. Mr. Ribeiro, a leading modern-dance choreographer from Lisbon, does not make things easy for himself or his audiences by focusing on one defining character or event. Instead, he presents a panoply of contradictory impulses over the hourlong work, impulses that are merged in a very human way, suggesting history unfolding before us.</p>
        <p>The most specific historical reference, which appears late in the piece like a sudden beam of probing light, is to Nazi Germany through the dancers' straight-armed salutes. The gestures are embedded in a long, slow-rolling wave of dance that establishes the seven performers as fully human in all their shifting, merging acuity and crudeness.</p>

        <p>Paulo Ribeiro takes on the large and amorphous topic of human good and evil in ''Blue Emerald,'' presented by the Paulo Ribeiro Dance Company on Friday night at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. Mr. Ribeiro, a leading modern-dance choreographer from Lisbon, does not make things easy for himself or his audiences by focusing on one defining character or event. Instead, he presents a panoply of contradictory impulses over the hourlong work, impulses that are merged in a very human way, suggesting history unfolding before us.</p>
        <p>The most specific historical reference, which appears late in the piece like a sudden beam of probing light, is to Nazi Germany through the dancers' straight-armed salutes. The gestures are embedded in a long, slow-rolling wave of dance that establishes the seven performers as fully human in all their shifting, merging acuity and crudeness.</p>
        <p>''Blue Emerald'' opens with a dance for two charming buffoons that widens out into a flowing series of entrances, exits and encounters. Love and battle, stupidity and shrewdness coexist here like facets of a not very precious jewel. Eventually a leader, portrayed by Mr. Ribeiro, emerges from the group and quickly establishes himself as all-powerful and cruel. By the end, ordinary men and women have become lumbering brutes, though still recognizable as human.</p>
        <p>The piece does not repay the concentration and stamina that are required to follow the dancers through the unvarying dynamics of the choreography and staging. But Nuno Rebelo's rollicking, sly score is perfect, suggesting a mix of Kurt Weill and a passing Gypsy hurdy-gurdy player. And the dancers are a remarkable blend of physical power, dramatic subtlety and well-honed technique that, along with their deftness and sharply articulated footwork, makes one long to see them in the works of Kurt Jooss, particularly ''Big City.''</p>
        <p>The cast also included Claudia de Serpa Soares, Leonor Keil, Paola Moreno, Peter Michael Dietz, Rowan Thorpe and Sofia Campos. ''Blue Emerald'' was presented by the center as part of its World Festival Portuguese Words and Ways series.</p>
