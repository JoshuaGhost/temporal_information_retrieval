        <p>CARDINALS 15, DIAMONDBACKS 5</p>
        <p>Mark McGwire is right back on track.</p>
        <p>McGwire hit three homers last night, breaking an eight-game homerless drought, as the St. Louis Cardinals routed the Arizona Diamondbacks, 15-5.</p>
        <p>McGwire, who tied Willie Mays's major league record by homering in the first four games of the season, had not homered since April 4. He has seven homers -- all at Busch Stadium -- and 22 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>McGwire hit a two-run homer in the third, a solo homer in the fifth and another two-run shot in the eighth, a 462-footer off Barry Manuel. It was his third three-homer game and first since June 11, 1995, for Oakland against Boston.</p>
        <p>The last Cardinal to hit three homers in a game was Mark Whiten, who hit four in the second game of a doubleheader at Cincinnati on Sept. 7, 1993.</p>
        <p>Matt Williams hit the first grand slam in Arizona's history. The Diamondbacks have lost six straight games and are 1-8 on their first road trip.</p>
        <p>Brian Jordan homered and had four r.b.i. for the Cardinals.</p>
        <p>BRAVES 6, PIRATES 0</p>
        <p>Kevin Millwood, the unsung member of Atlanta's rotation, pitched a one-hitter and had a career-high 13 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>The Braves did all of their scoring on three homers, including a three-run shot in the sixth by Andruw Jones, who entered the game hitting .100 with no homers and just one run batted in.</p>
        <p>But this night belonged to Millwood (2-0), the 23-year-old fifth starter in Atlanta's rotation who faced only two batters over the minimum and did not walk a batter.</p>
        <p>He had at least one strikeout in every inning and did not allow a baserunner until Jermaine Allensworth doubled to left-center on a hanging curve with one out in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh's only other baserunner reached in the seventh when Jason Kendall was hit by a pitch.</p>
        <p>It was Milwood's first career complete game in his 11th start.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 7 EXPOS 4</p>
        <p>John Jaha's bases-loaded triple highlighted a five-run second inning, and Scott Karl became the first Milwaukee pitcher to score a run since 1989.</p>
        <p>Karl gave up four hits in six and one-third innings, striking out five, and retired his final 11 batters.</p>
        <p>Karl singled in the second and came home on Jaha's big hit.</p>
