        <p>Starting Seeds  Q.  When I decided to grow annuals from seed this spring, the salesman insisted that along with seed-starting mix and covered trays, I should buy special grow lights. Since my windowsill light is minimal, I did buy them, and have had good results. I am now wondering, however, if the lights were necessary or if I could have used regular lights. Can you tell me exactly what makes a grow light different?  A.  It's good that you recognized that your window light wasn't going to be adequate. Even the sunniest window is sunny only for a relatively short period each day, and not much good at all on cloudy days. That is hardly the 16 hours of consistent high light needed to grow the sturdy seedlings that are ready for transplanting into the garden on time.</p>
        <p>Sunlight contains the full range of light, from ultraviolet and blue to red and infrared, and plants have adapted to use nearly all of it.</p>

        <p>Starting Seeds  Q.  When I decided to grow annuals from seed this spring, the salesman insisted that along with seed-starting mix and covered trays, I should buy special grow lights. Since my windowsill light is minimal, I did buy them, and have had good results. I am now wondering, however, if the lights were necessary or if I could have used regular lights. Can you tell me exactly what makes a grow light different?  A.  It's good that you recognized that your window light wasn't going to be adequate. Even the sunniest window is sunny only for a relatively short period each day, and not much good at all on cloudy days. That is hardly the 16 hours of consistent high light needed to grow the sturdy seedlings that are ready for transplanting into the garden on time.</p>
        <p>Sunlight contains the full range of light, from ultraviolet and blue to red and infrared, and plants have adapted to use nearly all of it.</p>
        <p>The question is, How close to sunlight is close enough?</p>
        <p>Specialized grow lights come much closer to reproducing sunlight than regular incandescent bulbs, which produce mostly red light, but very little blue. Fluorescent bulbs have varying amounts of all colors, with cool-white bulbs producing a bit more blue and a bit less red than warm-white bulbs.</p>
        <p>Special fluorescent grow lights do better at the red-blue balance than either cool white or warm white alone, but one cool white plus one warm white, 40 watts each, will do a perfectly reasonable job for raising seedlings.</p>
        <p>What's just as important is the amount of light. Two bulbs in a standard four-foot shop fixture, suspended 2 to 4 inches over the plants and left on 16 hours a day, will do the trick.</p>
        <p>Address questions to Garden Q.&amp; A., The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036, or by E-mail to gardening@nytimes .com. Those of general interest will be published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.</p>
