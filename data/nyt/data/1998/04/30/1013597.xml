        <p>Once upon a time David Cone was an innovator, concocting pitches and arm angles from inning to inning and batter to batter in the National League. Joe Girardi played against Cone then, and last night, when Cone threw a sweeping slider and starting improvising with his delivery, Girardi remembered the Cone of old.</p>
        <p>''That was the real David Cone tonight,'' Girardi said.  Cone was fine, striking out 11 without a walk in six innings, as the Yankees beat Seattle, 8-5, before 27,949 at Yankee Stadium. Tino Martinez had two runs batted in, giving him 27 in the first 22 games, and Chad Curtis bashed a three-run homer. The Yankees are 16-6, their best start since they went 17-5 at the outset of the 1958 season, the year the Dodgers and Giants moved to California and a Brooklyn native named Joe Torre graduated from St. Francis Prep School.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time David Cone was an innovator, concocting pitches and arm angles from inning to inning and batter to batter in the National League. Joe Girardi played against Cone then, and last night, when Cone threw a sweeping slider and starting improvising with his delivery, Girardi remembered the Cone of old.</p>
        <p>''That was the real David Cone tonight,'' Girardi said.  Cone was fine, striking out 11 without a walk in six innings, as the Yankees beat Seattle, 8-5, before 27,949 at Yankee Stadium. Tino Martinez had two runs batted in, giving him 27 in the first 22 games, and Chad Curtis bashed a three-run homer. The Yankees are 16-6, their best start since they went 17-5 at the outset of the 1958 season, the year the Dodgers and Giants moved to California and a Brooklyn native named Joe Torre graduated from St. Francis Prep School.</p>
        <p>Cone (3-2) beat Detroit twice in a week and that was progress, but the Tigers have been spiraling downward for a month, disqualifying them as a true litmus test for Cone. He had his first true trial against the Mariners, who rank second in the American League in runs and first in home runs. ''It's nice to face a team as potent as Seattle and get it all together and get a win,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What Cone finally had, specifically, was his slider -- the breaking ball he could not command in the cold of early April, the pitch he did not have to finish hitters off when he got two strikes. In his first four starts, Cone would get ahead in the count and then, because he couldn't throw his slider for strikes, hitters anticipated his fastball or his split-finger fastball and, with a 50 percent chance of guessing correctly, they repeatedly punched out two-strike hits.</p>
        <p>Once Cone established his slider last night, however, the odds shifted in his favor dramatically. Cone threw fastballs to the outside corner for strikes and followed that with the slider aimed at the same spot, and the Mariners would flail helplessly when the pitch spun out of their reach; Russ Davis whiffed three times this way. Pitching to the outer half of the strike zone, as he did all night, Cone avoided the inside half, where the Seattle hitters do most of their long-ball damage.</p>
        <p>Only twice did the Mariners push Cone to a three-ball count; of the 110 pitches Cone threw, an astounding 79 were for strikes, and from all different angles. Sometimes Cone paused in mid-delivery, left leg in the air, a right-handed flamingo. Sometimes he would start this way and throw sidearm sliders. Sometimes he would throw sidearm fastballs. Sometimes, with runners on base, he would twist and turn his head just before releasing the ball; imagine Linda Blair pitching in ''The Exorcist.'' All of it, Girardi agreed later, is evidence that Cone is feeling good about himself now, after a slow start.</p>
        <p>''He used to do a lot of that funky stuff,'' said Girardi, the Yankee catcher, recalling the inventive Cone. ''I think he just sits at home and thinks up this stuff. He just pulls things out of the hat when he needs it.''</p>
        <p>Cone had to invent early, after the Yankees' defense eliminated his margin for error. In the first inning, third baseman Scott Brosius dropped a fly ball and Tim Raines turned left, right and around completely before a double zoomed over his head. Cone made a bad pitch to David Segui, who whacked a two-run single, and just like that, the Mariners led, 3-0.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees responded in the bottom of the first, with a lineup altered for this game. Torre, the Yankees' manager, started Raines in left, Chad Curtis in right and Jorge Posada as the designated hitter, to rest Paul O'Neill, who is hitless in his last 21 at-bats. Two batters into the first, Derek Jeter slammed a 405-foot home run. Raines singled, Bernie Williams walked and Martinez looped the first of his two run-scoring singles; he has 14 hits in his last 24 at-bats (.583) with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>Davis blew an easy throw in the third inning, setting up a two-on, two-out chance for Curtis. Jeff Fassero (2-1), Seattle's starting pitcher, tried throwing a split-finger fastball to Curtis -- except this splitter didn't split. Curtis hit it belly-button high, driving the mistake pitch beyond the wall in left field to give the Yankees a 5-3 lead. With 17 r.b.i., Curtis has as many as Williams (9) and O'Neill (8) combined.</p>
        <p>Cone recorded his last four outs with strikeouts, the crowd bursting into cheers when he struck out the side in the sixth. His pitch count high, Cone was replaced for the seventh, but the inventor departed having pitched, in Torre's words, his best game of the 1998 season.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>GRAEME LLOYD has bursitis in his pitching shoulder, which might force him to the disabled list. The left-handed reliever had a magnetic resonance imaging scan yesterday and played catch in the outfield before last night's game. He indicated that his condition had improved since he initially felt pain on Sunday. . . . BRIAN CASHMAN, the Yankees' general manager, said yesterday that the Cuban right-hander ORLANDO HERNANDEZ's promotion from Class AAA was not imminent. ''If we needed a starting pitcher right now from the minors, it wouldn't be Orlando Hernandez,'' Cashman said. ''It probably would be MIKE JERZEMBECK. I'd be surprised if we had El Duque up here before the All-Star break.''</p>
