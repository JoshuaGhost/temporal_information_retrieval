      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It's not a typical birdcage that Vaughn Alexis is selling out of his apartment at 14 De Groot Place on Staten Island. He describes the glass environments he has invented as ''4-foot-by-1-foot-by-2-foot-high jungles.'' Using the trade name Ecosystems etc, he sells them for $650.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Alexis's nine-month-old test ecosystem, two finches coexist peacefully with anoles (chameleonlike lizards), crickets, gouramies (small tropical fish), flowers and squat palms. The birds frolic in a mini-pond while the lizards eat the crickets. The airtight system recycles urine and evaporated water, has automatic feeder compartments for the birds and fish and a fluorescent light that goes for 12 hours each day.</p>
