        <p>SOCRATES was accused of corrupting youth. So is John Burroughs, who happens to be a teacher of classical civilization in ''The Council of 30,'' at the George Street Playhouse here. Between 399 B.C. in Athens and ''the present in multiple locales,'' in the words of the program, perverters of the young and the pure, proven and alleged, factual and fictitious, have been defended and vilified by the thousands. But they weren't all wearing togas.</p>
        <p>Even though Burroughs (played by Reed Birney) doesn't dress like a born-again Socrates after the play's ludicrous and mercifully short first scene, he goes on thinking like one.</p>
        <p>And it isn't easy to get over the first assaultive, then numbing effect of four actors -- the entire cast -- in one short scene standing around, posing, two asking, and asking again, the unanswerable: ''Why can't anything ever be simple?'' ''Why are some people born knowing the right way to live?''</p>
        <p>Not that the other two actors don't recite in response: ''Look in your heart, my friend,'' and ''The most important things we can ever hope to learn are the things we already know.'' The playwright, Bob Clyman, has the answers, but he doesn't listen to the questions, even though they are his own. Of course, people by the thousands have just that comic flaw. But they don't all write plays. And ''The Council of 30'' is not a comedy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clyman, who is also a clinical psychologist, gets down to business in the second scene. It is mean and nasty business, and Mr. Clyman is unfazed by getting down and dirty.</p>
        <p>Even though he lapses into lumpy, self-important Grecian associations and Socratic allusions, the playwright knows that the language of litigation is essential for survival in contentious contemporary society, especially for the scarred and the imprisoned, suffering the fallout of the love-and-marriage battleground.</p>
        <p>Only ostensibly about the debilitating side effects of a child custody dispute, Mr. Clyman's play is not another vicious variation of the ''he says, she says'' genre. The unseen child, who ages from 4 to 5 during the play, is unlikely to have a plausible say, given his age and vulnerable, brainwashed state.</p>
        <p>For there is an objective truth here that the audience will never know, and it is less important than the fact that John and Beth Burroughs, divorced, have loved and go on loving. What makes Mr. Clyman's play touch on the poignant and then disturb deeply is the brutality of that fact.</p>
        <p>It takes a beastly, crude lawyer, of the kind you despise but simply must keep on retainer, to plant the evil seeds of suspicion in Beth's alcohol-hazed mind that her husband is molesting their son, Jason. The only way Beth can win custody of Jason is by proving that his father is a pedophile.</p>
        <p>The ''Crucible''-like, McCarthy-like finger points. The P-word spreads. Mr. Burroughs won't be a teacher in an boys' prep school for long. And, of course, a man with a life of the mind is going to reflect and agonize. When it comes to the techniques of guilt and self-torture, he is a quick study. Just as scary is the way intelligent people can be so civilized while they're cutting one another up. All those mythic parallels are superfluous.</p>
        <p>Once the director, Wendy Liscow, moves past the damaging first scene (it isn't easy) and Mr. Clyman gets on with it, Ms. Liscow faces fire with fire. She knows how to engage an audience's ever-shifting sympathies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Birney is excellent as soon as he is allowed to reveal the suit and tie under that unflattering robe. Elaine Bromka deftly takes on four roles and Richmond Hoxie five, including the offensive lawyer. And Kristin Griffith, as Beth, gives a many-colored performance, encompassing denial, vindictiveness, turnaround and immense compassion.</p>
        <p>Whether John Burroughs is guilty is not an issue. It isn't likely that Beth, or many in the audience believe he is. The point is that relationships, caring, commitment -- all those dream words -- invoke the talent to destroy. Add the mighty costs of loving to the killer fees of the sleazy lawyers, who are the only winners, and you have all the answers you needed to know.</p>
