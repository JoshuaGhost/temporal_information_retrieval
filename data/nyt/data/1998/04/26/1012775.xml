        <p>A parole hearing date of May 21 has been set for Tony Ayala Jr., the 35-year-old former world junior-middleweight contender, who has served 15 years in three New Jersey prisons for a rape he committed as a 19-year-old in 1981.</p>

        <p>A parole hearing date of May 21 has been set for Tony Ayala Jr., the 35-year-old former world junior-middleweight contender, who has served 15 years in three New Jersey prisons for a rape he committed as a 19-year-old in 1981.</p>
        <p>''It's a process we're optimistic about, but we don't know what the outcome will be,'' said Milt Chwasky, Ayala's New York-based attorney. ''We think we've complied in every way.''</p>
        <p>Ayala, an inmate at the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, N.J., will meet with two of the eight members of the New Jersey State Parole Board during his hearing. After an interview with Ayala, those two members will decide whether Ayala should be granted parole. If he is granted parole, Ayala will still remain behind bars for 30 days while his parole is processed.</p>
        <p>Even though he hasn't boxed for over 15 years, offers from promoters have been flooding in. Chwasky said they would not talk about any boxing matters until Ayala is a free man. Promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank Boxing said he is interested in promoting Ayala and has said he would make Ayala's first match a championship bout against either Yory Boy Campos or Keith Mullings in the fall once Ayala is released.</p>
