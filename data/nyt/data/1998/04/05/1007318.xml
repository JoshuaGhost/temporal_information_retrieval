        <p>There were so many layers of satin to the white christening dress that Rose could hardly find the baby inside.

        <p>It was a bit more than she had bargained for six years ago when she hired Jacqueline to care for her children, organize their schedules, buy and cook the meals, keep her house clean and generally make the life of her family possible. Jacqueline -- who is identified by her middle name to protect her privacy, as are all the other characters in this story -- had broken the news of her pregnancy seven months before. She had dragged the vacuum cleaner halfway up the stairs, sat down and begun to cry. Rose, a psychotherapist, had never seen her like that. Normally stalwart, Jacqueline had brought structure, discipline and neatness to the household. As she consoled her nanny, Rose saw her own tightly woven existence unraveling. She could not have been more undone had her husband announced he was leaving. Without Jacqueline, she could not manage.</p>
        <p>As water was dripped onto the baby's head, the congregation murmured, Oh yes, Lord, and Rose's daughter, Tecla, age 6 at the time, gazed wide-eyed at a woman swaying and bowing behind her. Rose worried that Tecla would ask loudly what was wrong with the woman, a worry that reflected her deeper fear of what the future might hold for a white woman with a black godchild. Yet as she beheld the chocolate-colored face, and the faces of her own family -- Tecla, her husband, Ira, and son, Louis -- sitting in the pew, she also felt the exhilaration of having ascended a mountain.</p>
        <p>Across the economic spectrum, child care in America is generally inadequate. Even if mothers have finally started to win acceptance in the workplace, their children often still pay a heavy price. The poorest mothers rely on friends or relatives, sometimes barely out of childhood themselves. In urban areas, some middle-class women hire immigrant labor, often illegal and inexperienced. These nannies work 10 to 16 hours a day, 5 or 6 days a week, living with their employers in cramped apartments as closely as roommates.</p>
        <p>Green cards, which enable aliens to work legally, can take years to obtain. Until they get theirs, immigrant women remain trapped in legal limbo without health insurance, social benefits or job security. Parents, for their part, turn over the most precious part of their lives to a stranger whom they have known for little more than the hour it takes for a job interview. For Rose and Jacqueline, as for thousands of others, it is an intimate and unlikely cross-cultural alliance, often just the other side of the law, textured with deception and affection, mistrust and trust.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline, 34, grew up in the flat farmlands of a Caribbean island. She set up house in a one-room apartment with her common-law husband, a fireman, and had two children. But when her daughter was 7 and her son was 2, she became restless. Her aunt, who had emigrated, told her that in America you could live in a real house and still send home enough goods and money to lift your kids out of poverty.</p>
        <p>I kept saying, should I do it, or should I not, Jacqueline says. It was so hard to leave. My son was very attached; he slept with us, he breast-fed until he was 18 months. Finally, I just closed my eyes and said this is the only chance my kids will have, and I left them with their father.</p>
        <p>She went to New Jersey and worked for two years for an elderly invalid. Meanwhile, in Manhattan, Rose was coping with the newborn, Tecla, Louis had attention-deficit disorder and the family had begun renovating their Upper East Side town house. Rose stopped working and looked for more stable help than the au pairs she had been using. I needed someone to be me when I wasn't there, Rose says. My walls were half down and I was a wreck. Jacqueline had a quiet confidence; she came in and she knew just what to do.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline had never lived with a white family before, and it felt strange. They made big meals with so many different kinds of food, and the children, not the adults, were like the high point of everything.</p>
        <p>About half the nannies she knew were unhappy, stuck in situations they likened to a 1990's form of slavery: white parents who delegate all responsibility for rearing their children to an overworked, often illegal immigrant. They treat their help like she's not human, Jacqueline says. They make her come at 7 A.M. to get the kids up and ready for school so they can sleep late, and then they work all day and go out at night. One woman out in the Hamptons, you always see her carrying two separate bags of groceries. She had to buy her own food, even though she cooked for the family. They even had a lock on the icebox.''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline quickly found that she was one of the lucky ones. Rose and Ira treated me with respect. We did things together. They had nice friends, not the type that are way up there and you're down here and they pass you by like you're furniture. She was able to send home $100 a month and still afford to telephone her kids regularly. She tacked up pictures of them in the smart new American clothes she had sent. She grew attached to Tecla and Louis, and particularly liked shooting baskets with Louis.</p>
        <p>Rose opened up the world of America to Jacqueline. She sent her to driver's education, taught her to stand up for her rights against the bureaucracy in the torturous process of getting a green card and set up bank accounts for her, giving her two checks a week, one to put in savings. She paid her doctor's bills, went to her aunt's wedding, got her cousin a nanny's job two doors away and ended up going over to help whenever the cousin, who was inexperienced with children, called in tears. When the father of Jacqueline's two children came to visit, Rose let him stay at their house in the Hamptons. Jacqueline gave in kind to Rose. She was better at some aspects of mothering than I am, Rose says. I'm a pushover. She would make them sit down at mealtime and take a bath every night. Instead of letting them sit in front of the television, she played board games with them for hours. I would tear my hair out after five minutes of those games. I watched the kids become more and more attached.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline tried to nudge the kids toward Rose when she wanted them, for she knew how it felt to be afraid you were losing your kids. But Rose faced her own jealous feelings head on. When the kids would start to run to Jacqueline instead of me, I would just run and put myself between them. Rose's children are adopted, so their devotion to Jacqueline had particular resonance. You fret sometimes -- do they really have any special attachment to you? One day, when we were preparing to leave for my dad's birthday, Tecla whined, 'How come Jacqueline isn't coming?' and I said: 'Because you and Louis and Dad and me, we are a family and this is a family gathering. Jacqueline lives with us but she is not family.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline's own children remained out of her reach. She was unable to travel home -- her green card application was still pending, so she could not have gotten back into the country. Nor could her children visit, because the American authorities in Caribbean countries routinely reject such visa applications.</p>
        <p>After a year or so, jacqueline's children stopped asking when she was coming home. Her son learned to talk, her daughter learned to read and they seemed to grow out of one set of clothes before Jacqueline could send them another. When she picked up the phone to call them, her heart would race. You know who this is? she would ask, and then heave a sigh of relief when her boy or girl said, Of course, it's you, Mommy. Small things, especially ironing Tecla's and Louis's clothes, could set her off. A pair of jeans, a little velour dress, sometimes I just held them up and thought about my kids. I kept saying, one day they'll be with me, we'll be back together.''</p>
        <p>Rose was as skillful as Jacqueline in denying the troubling aspects of her separation from her children. My fantasy about Jacqueline is that she is very much like me. She did what she was supposed to do. She had her kids and then she dared to go after something different. I just did it in reverse order. If I was stuck in some backwater and there was a world out there I wanted to be part of, I think I would leave my kids with my sister. It's not as though you lose them forever.</p>
        <p>Rose, 51, who grew up in an extended Italian family, and Ira, 55, who is proud of his working-class roots, came to depend on Jacqueline's solid values to counteract the consumerism that saturated their children's world. ''She had this folk wisdom,'' Rose says. ''Like one time Louis came home complaining that his new shoes were not Gucci's like his friends'. She told him, 'Listen here, Louis, they are nice shoes, and it doesn't matter whether they are Gucci or Pucci or any other label.'''</p>
        <p>Ira says: ''We gave Jacqueline complete authority. We told our kids, when we are not here, you listen to Jacqueline. She is the mommy.''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline plays her daughter's life like a movie in her head, picturing her traveling to and from one of the island's best high schools, which is far from her home. Jacqueline had paid for a tutor to prepare her for the school's rigorous entrance exams, and had sent her a couple hundred dollars for books and the $5 daily taxi fare. Still, she worries that none of this will make up for what her daughter, now 16, is missing. ''I want her to have that mother-daughter thing. I keep saying it will happen one day, but then one day, they are almost grown up and you still haven't got them here.''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline panicked when she realized she was pregnant with her third child. ''What was I going to do? Send another child away? But how could I raise it in this country? And then I remembered it wasn't my decision alone.''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline, Rose and Ira had a meeting after the children were asleep. Ira cleared his throat. Jacqueline was the caretaker of his family, and that in itself meant he must ultimately take care of her. She was his third adopted child. Now must he acquire a fourth? This could not have come at a worse time. He was changing jobs, Louis was changing schools -- the family was in flux.</p>
        <p>Ira, a financial consultant, was a conservative who often held forth on the evils of big government and the welfare state, which he believes encourage poor single women to have children. He tried to fall back on these abstractions. Jacqueline, do you expect us to be responsible for your mistake?'' he asked. ''What is the father going to do?'' Jacqueline shook her head: nothing. Such a question was seldom asked in her culture.</p>
        <p>''What kind of a message is that going to send to Tecla and Louis? Being pregnant and not married. Bringing up a child without a father.''</p>
        <p>''I can take care of it,'' she replied.</p>
        <p>''You can't. And I'm not going to. If I did, it would violate all my beliefs about the obligations of people to face the consequences of their own actions.'' Rose looked daggers at him; he did not notice that Jacqueline was quietly crying.</p>
        <p>Such is the nature of the relationship that while the employer regularly unfurls his feelings, the nanny, by dint of culture and necessity, sits mute. ''I could have said something, but I chose not to,'' Jacqueline says. Instead, she resolved, then and there, to have the baby and keep it, whatever the consequences. ''I was very, very hurt. I'd been working there six years and felt so comfortable with them and I understood what Ira was saying about not being married and all, but nobody was thinking about me. Don't I get to have a little taste of life, even if it isn't supposed to be like this?''</p>
        <p>Jacquelne proceeded to take chunks of time off for prenatal appointments, turning over to Rose the job of toting her children around to sports and ballet lessons. Rose went around looking stunned, saying to her friends: I can't believe it. I just can't believe this is happening. What am I going to do?</p>
        <p>Rose worried about her children's reaction to the advancing pregnancy and the issues it would raise about their unmarried birth mothers not having kept them. But Louis, then 9, appeared to care not at all about Jacqueline's condition and Tecla acted delighted, touching and even kissing her stomach. Ira felt easier about appearing to condone unmarried motherhood by implying that the father of her other children was also the father of this one. To his surprise, friends and neighbors said not a word about her swelling size.</p>
        <p>Rose and Tecla got into the spirit, buying baby clothes, collecting hand-me-down equipment from cousins, calling Jacqueline's nanny friends and organizing a baby shower. Jacqueline worked until three weeks before she was due. Rose and Ira gave her paid maternity leave for the summer, and on July 18, 1996, she gave birth to a healthy eight-and-a-half-pound girl. She named her Shemel. ''I was so happy,'' Jacqueline says. She filled that big empty spot inside. It was like having my other children here. In September, she returned to work, paying her landlady to look after the baby. At night and on weekends, she returned home to Shemel. It is an uneasy alliance at times. Shemel and Rose compete for Jacqueline's attention. ''With Tecla and Louis in school all day,'' Rose says, ''I really need a sitter in the early morning and evenings.''</p>
        <p>Says Jacqueline firmly: ''That's when my baby needs to know I'm there -- that I make her breakfast and come back home at night to put her to bed.'' That winter, the baby came with Jacqueline for a week in the Hamptons, and Tecla and Louis diapered and played with her constantly. But when Rose packed up to spend the summer in the Hamptons, Jacqueline reluctantly sent Shemel to stay with relatives in the Caribbean. ''I needed to work to make money, and I knew I couldn't bring her along. She was too little. When I put her on the plane with my sister, we both wept.'' At the time, Jacqueline hadn't any idea how she was going to get Shemel home. It wasn't until the end of August that a tourist was found who agreed to shepherd her home.</p>
        <p>Shemel has given Jacqueline a little more of the aura of equality. More than ever, Rose feels self-conscious about the tremendous financial gap. She and all the other nannies have to pass all these pricey children's clothes shops near the schools. I have taken to cutting the price tags off things I bring home. You feel guilty and you try to hide the difference, but of course, you cannot.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the two of them have a silent battle of wills. Rose gets sharp-tongued and Jacqueline narrows her eyes and sulks. The two are capable of spoiling each other's day. ''In an office, grumpiness is dispersed among the sheer numbers,'' Rose says. ''You give a report to a secretary to do and boom, it gets done. I can give Jacqueline all the prioritized lists in the world and she will do things in exactly the order she wants. For instance, she loves to do laundry, but only all at once. She will iron every single undershirt, and heaven help the streaks and fingerprints on the mirrors. On the green marble kitchen table is a plant whose parched leaves slowly lift as Rose waters it. She gives a little smile. ''This particular plant is our Gettysburg. It's a contest to see who will be the one to let it die.''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline says: ''Well, you have to work how you work best. I have my own rhythm -- and my pride. Also, you know white people have attitude, too, and, boy, do they let it hang out.'' Late one recent Friday, Jacqueline was preparing to leave for the weekend while Rose was taking an important phone call. Louis burst in, declaring he was hungry. Without bothering Rose, Jacqueline ducked out to the deli and came back with some cheese, which is all Louis will eat these days.</p>
        <p>''Mmm, what a great-looking sandwich,'' Ira says, coming into the kitchen as Jacqueline butters fresh pita bread and piles on the cheese. ''You know, Jacqueline claims she can't cook.'' Rose laughs. ''She can cook, but she won't,'' she says, looking at Jacqueline. ''I even tried therapy on you to get to the root of this cooking phobia, right?''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline puts the cheese back in the fridge. ''I have to be in the mood,'' she says coyly, then rolls down the extra-long sleeves of the special shirts Rose buys her and puts on her coat. Rose looks longingly at the highly piled sandwich. ''Gosh, that does look good!'' Jacqueline asks her if she wants one and turns to take out the cheese, but Rose waves her on.</p>
        <p>I drive Jacqueline to her apartment in Brooklyn, and when I park in front of her small brick row house, she disconnects the car phone and hides it under the seat. ''We will keep an eye on the car from the living room,'' she says.</p>
        <p>The stairway is battered, but inside, the apartment is cozy and the few pieces of furniture--two white sofas, blond dining-room set, single decorative fern, antique mirror--are immaculate. There are three tiny bedrooms, one each for her cousin, her sister and herself. Out toddles Shemel, then 18 months old, in a lovely pink sweater set, with her fine hair arranged in seven tiny braids around her head. She brings out her toys, a black doll, a white clown and a toy telephone to show me, a stranger, while ignoring her mother. ''I phone her during the day so we can hear each other's voices,'' Jacqueline says. ''But she still punishes me for leaving her all day.''</p>
        <p>Shemel is a beautiful and engaging child with delicate, impish features. She holds the receiver to her ear and cries, ''Dadadada, yayaya, uh-huh, uh-huh,'' and then hangs up, grins at me and turns to throws her arms around her mother. The toddler leads me to her bedroom, where she gives me a pair of smart patent leather hiking boots to put on her so she can do a little dance. Her snowsuit and four outfits hang on a wall bar. Beneath it is her crib, and flush with that is her mother's double bed. Squeezed nearby is a long bureau, half devoted to Jacqueline's toiletries and half to Shemel's Pampers and baby paraphernalia. In between are two pictures in identical frames: one of Jacqueline's son and older daughter, who have her heart-shaped face, and the other of Jacqueline surrounded by Louis and Tecla.</p>
        <p>Although it is usually past 8:30 when Jacqueline gets home at night, the first thing she does is pack Shemel's bag with clothes and toys and Pampers for the next day at the landlady's apartment downstairs. Then she will eat a little something, drink a cup of tea and lie with her baby until she sleeps. She has cut back her monthly checks home to $50. ''I'm saving up so that whatever it takes, I'll get my other two over here so we can, for a while, be a family. It's been too hard to explain to them why I left, but I have to now or it will be too late for them to forgive me.''</p>
        <p>Before I go, Shemel puckers her little lips to kiss me and points to a picture taped to the wall -- a glittery scribble of yellow that Tecla helped her draw during a recent weekend when Tecla stayed with them. Rose worried the whole time, even though I knew Jacqueline would guard her with her life. Tecla has begged to go back, but Rose wants to keep her from getting any more attached to the baby. ''I need to wean Tecla away from Jacqueline because if she leaves. . .I mean, she does have her own family now. How is it going to affect my kids?''</p>
        <p>Rose wants to ask Jacqueline what she sees in her future. ''Does she see herself going back to the Caribbean? Or staying with us for the rest of her life? I'd like to ask her where she feels her real home is, but the truth is, either way, I'm afraid of what the answer will be.''
