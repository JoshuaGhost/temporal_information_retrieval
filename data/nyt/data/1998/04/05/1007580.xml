        <p>MAYBE it's a myth about sharks and blood in the water, but I shaved extra carefully this morning. The dive master didn't help by mentioning that the five ragged-tooth sharks would eat later. ''They'll be hungry,'' he confirmed. ''They haven't been fed since Tuesday.''</p>

        <p>MAYBE it's a myth about sharks and blood in the water, but I shaved extra carefully this morning. The dive master didn't help by mentioning that the five ragged-tooth sharks would eat later. ''They'll be hungry,'' he confirmed. ''They haven't been fed since Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>This is Sunday. Sunday lunch time, from my point of view, and I hope no one else's.</p>
        <p>I have only a few seconds of sitting on the sunlit platform of the predator tank, struggling with my fins as my feet dangle like flesh fishhooks, to think about what awaits below. A bunch of dark seven-foot-long shapes, with midships like the shoulders of bulls, scythe-shaped tails and so many teeth that they cannot close their mouths. Looking on from outside the tank are a bunch of tourists who have spotted the human toes up at the top and are waiting to see what will happen. If the Romans had had Plexiglas, this would have made good circus fare.</p>
        <p>The Cape Town aquarium is the world's only aquarium to let visitors entertain other tourists from inside a shark tank. Asked why, Helen Lockhart, its spokeswoman, answered, ''Public demand.''</p>
        <p>No, seriously.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' she swore. ''We've had a lot of people say: 'Oh, it's fantastic. I'd love to be able to dive in there.' And it's educational. It teaches visitors that sharks aren't the monsters of the deep.''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe not from her point of view. But from where I sat, things looked different. Ragged-tooth sharks resemble an orthodontist's sick joke: three rows of teeth spilling out of their mouths and, to add to the picture, they make chewing motions as they swim to pump water over their gills.</p>
        <p>Americans may get spiritual rejuvenation from swimming with dolphins, but South Africans get a charge out of baiting sharks. This is a macho country on a violent continent, and there are many extreme-sports nuts. At the same time, however, there's probably less swagger than in America. Just as rugby heroes here simply let the ball drop without an end-zone dance, adventurers are more in the mold of Sir Edmund Hillary; they do crazy things and then dismiss them as moments of silliness, a lark.</p>
        <p>There are several ways of communing with sharks here. One can be towed in an underwater cage through the great white shark waters off the town of Gansbaai. Ichthyologists consider that a fatality waiting to happen, and there is legislation in the works to control it, but the new Parliament has bigger fish to fry.  One can scuba with groups who sit on the bottom near Aliwal Shoals and open boxes of chopped fish to attract hammerheads. But the coolest way, said Dudley Powell, a scuba instructor, is to wait for the annual sardine run, and then dive straight into the seething masses. They form a silver bubble around you; the sharks chomp through it, spot you and veer off at the last second. Or so he swears.</p>
        <p>Such risks are possible only because this is a non-litigious society where liability insurance is affordable. I signed a release in the suiting-up room, and here releases mean something. There are no juries, and the typical judge would hold that anyone who dives into a pool of sharks gets what he deserves.</p>
        <p>When divers arrive in the morning, they're nervous, Mark Mansour, the dive master, said. They're talking too fast, making weak jokes.</p>
        <p>Like?</p>
        <p>Like: ''What do you do if a shark comes for you? Pull out your knife, stab your buddy and swim out.''</p>
        <p>It's understandable. This isn't the Kelp Forest exhibit, where fronds of seaweed wave to and fro as New Age music washes dreamily over the tourists and colorful fish flit between the stalks. If the predator tank had a soundtrack, it would be from West Side Story. Its 300 inhabitants swim clockwise around a central rock obsessively, as if caught in a traffic circle. Outside the tank, hopped-up little boys run around firing toy pistols at the sharks.</p>
        <p>Actually, I know perfectly well that the raggies down there are not man-eaters. Despite their fearsome appearance, they're docile. Shark species have personalities, albeit on a rudimentary level.</p>
        <p>As do individual sharks. These raggies even have names -- Maxine, Floyd, Dee, Bella and Val. They are all named after aquarium people except Val, who got hers from all the valium she had to be pumped with to get her in here. It wore off weeks ago, and I don't know which one she is. I do know which one is Maxine, because she's the biggest. ''She sometimes comes up behind you, sort of pokes at you, then swims by, about half a meter away,'' Mr. Mansour said. Lovely. Shark peekaboo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mansour is a character himself. He's 19, wears a fossilized great white shark's tooth around his neck and carries one weapon: a sawed-off broomstick. In his wet suit bottoms, with the broomstick tucked under his arm, he looks like half a seal and half a sergeant major.</p>
        <p>You are free, he says, to touch the stingray, named Susie, or the turtles, the yellowtails, the pompano or the small gully sharks. If you can -- they're fast. But reach for one of the raggies, and you'll be escorted out of the exhibit. ''They're not a toy you can play with,'' Mr. Mansour warns, unnecessarily. ''We're in their world, not ours. Just watch and blow bubbles.''</p>
        <p>Stefan Thwaites, 28, a London motorcycle dealer, has flown to Cape Town to dive in its tank three times since the practice started in December. ''I've dived all over the world,'' he said, ''and I'm thoroughly bored of coral. This is a guaranteed dive -- no matter what, you are going to see sharks.''</p>
        <p>Yes, indeed. I can see them now, just below me. I had called Mr. Thwaites before I went, and he said the biggest problem would be the cold. The water is chilly, and you aren't encouraged to swim around.</p>
        <p>Once I slipped underwater, the aquarium experience changed completely. It is silent. The only noises are your own bubbles and the crackle of pressure changes in your ears. We kneel on the bottom, we're told to stay next to the rock. The fish continue to circle. They avoid our columns of bubbles. There's a theory that sharks' electrical sensors perceive diver and bubbles as one entity, so we seem yards tall to them. But only a theory.</p>
        <p>The world is reversed. Now the scary faces behind the glass are those of children. Some point. One makes a shark face, but he's missing too many teeth. Some quail as Mr. Mansour beckons to them -- come on in. Because of my mask, I still have the feeling of being behind glass, but I can dispel it somewhat by looking at my pale, vulnerable hand. Mr. Mansour clowns with his broomstick, letting it float off, then grabbing it.</p>
        <p>Maxine comes up behind me, although I cannot see her. Mr. Mansour points. I turn my head, and she goes past, excruciatingly slow. I'm fine. But the artificial current starts to topple me. I have a moment of panic -- my hand starts to flail, as slowly as possible, to keep me upright. Maxine's tiny eye flicks once. I'm falling down, underwater, in front of an audience, which probably thinks I'm doing this on purpose.</p>
        <p>Maxine's tail brushes my back. She moves slowly off. I put a hand down and check my fall.</p>
        <p>That's the closest encounter of this chilly half-hour.</p>
        <p>The sharks quickly lose interest in us. The most remarkable thing is the skin of Susie, the ray. She is six feet in diameter, and undulates across the bottom like a flamenco dancer's skirt. But she feels like jelly -- 500 pounds of cold aspic.</p>
        <p>When we climb out -- me, rather reluctantly -- Mr. Mansour congratulates me on the tail-brush. Not on my reaction, but just on getting so lucky.</p>
        <p>In the changing room, I see how lucky I've really been. Billy Stanley, another aquarium worker, is dabbing a cut on his face. ''I went in to feed them,'' he said, ''and they bit me. They're not scared of people at all.''</p>
        <p>Who? I asked.</p>
        <p>''Ach, a little steentjie,'' he said, referring to a small fish. ''In the kelp tank.''</p>
