        <p>Bob J Frye, English teacher at Texas Christian University, has been writing letters to his students and receiving letters from them since 1978; he began exercise to break the ice at start of class, and is now writing book on letter-writing as tool to establish rapport; his photo (special section, Education Life) (S)</p>

        <p>It began in 1978, Bob J. Frye recalled, as a way to break the ice at the beginning of the semester for his English composition class at Texas Christian University, in Fort Worth. He would write a letter introducing himself to the class, then ask each student to write a letter to him, once a week. No grades on the letters; just an exercise.</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, Mr. Frye (pictured above) is still asking his students to write letters. He has kept all 5,000 they have written to him, and the 325 he has written to them.</p>

        <p>It began in 1978, Bob J. Frye recalled, as a way to break the ice at the beginning of the semester for his English composition class at Texas Christian University, in Fort Worth. He would write a letter introducing himself to the class, then ask each student to write a letter to him, once a week. No grades on the letters; just an exercise.</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, Mr. Frye (pictured above) is still asking his students to write letters. He has kept all 5,000 they have written to him, and the 325 he has written to them.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Frye plans to write a book touting letter-writing as a tool to establish a stronger rapport between student and professor.</p>
        <p>''There's something inviting and disarming about the process,'' he said. ''I'm trying to get them to open their minds, so that they learn to pay attention and observe the world much more carefully.''</p>
        <p>In his weekly letters to his class, Mr. Frye has written on everything from his daughter's 18th birthday to the importance of role models. His students' letters are usually two- or three-page ruminations on subjects like dormitory irritations, laundry woes and career choices.</p>
        <p>But some students use the letters as a cathartic release. In 1989, for instance, Elizabeth Lunday wrote about coming to grips with her 90-year-old grandfather's failing faculties: ''My grandfather is lost and I don't know where to find him. ... He is not here and he is not now and he is not anywhere or anytime that anyone else can find. ...</p>
        <p>His birthday was today.''  BLACKBOARD: CLASS CORRESPONDENCE</p>
