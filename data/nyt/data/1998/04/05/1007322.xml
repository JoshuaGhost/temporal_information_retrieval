        <p>Until about last week, I fully viewed myself as the mother of multiples. (I have two kids under 6, which feels like having four.) As it turns out, I was deluded. Talk to mothers of twins, triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, and they will (sort of) smile. Then they will suggest that I, a mere mother of ''singletons,'' don't have a clue. We may all be moms but we do not belong to the same national chapter of motherhood.</p>

        <p>There are right now more twins, triplets and ''higher order'' multiples than ever in history. The numbers: since 1980, twin births in the United States have increased 42 percent while triplet, quad and other multiple births have risen 272 percent. The primary reason: fertility drugs. But attention paid to ''medical miracles'' like the McCaughey Seven of Des Moines obscures the very real complexities of multiple motherhood: serious illness, endless expense and the daily anarchy of life with 4 or so kids who seem like 10.  Rineke Dijkstra is an Amsterdam-based photographer. Betsy Israel wrote about Amy Fisher for the magazine in July 1996.</p>
