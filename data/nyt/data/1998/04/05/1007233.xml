        <p>BROWN - BORENSTEIN - Lillian. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a dear friend who, with her beloved husband, Samuel, was a YU Guardian. With her first husband, the late A. Milton Brown, she was a Founder of YU's Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a Fellow of our affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. We extend our heartfelt condolences to children, B. Warren and Benjamin Brown; grandchildren; greatgrandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman Board of Trustees</p>
        <p>BROWN - BORENSTEIN - Lillian. Your friendship at the Nautilus is remembered and treasured by us all. Shirley and Danny Rubin</p>
