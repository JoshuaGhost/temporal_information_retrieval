        <p>FOR a few minutes in January, it seemed to really matter that my right shoulder leans forward slightly more than my left. I was in Hong Kong, being fitted for a suit at W. W. Chan and Sons, one of the last of the city's great custom tailoring shops. As soon as I announced I wanted a suit made, it appeared that neither chicken flu nor crashing stock markets nor the return of the Chinese Government could keep these master craftsmen from working their measuring-tape magic. Suddenly, I was at the center of a storm of white chalk, straight pins and perspiration. Tang Yan Choi, a stout, tough-looking man, who -- like many of the best Chinese tailors -- claims Shanghai as his place of origin, tapped me in eight or nine places and grunted out something in Cantonese, while Raymond K. K. Kiang, the manager of the 41-year-old shop, took furious notes.</p>
        <p>''That's his secret method,'' Mr. Kiang told me. ''He reads your body.''</p>

        <p>FOR a few minutes in January, it seemed to really matter that my right shoulder leans forward slightly more than my left. I was in Hong Kong, being fitted for a suit at W. W. Chan and Sons, one of the last of the city's great custom tailoring shops. As soon as I announced I wanted a suit made, it appeared that neither chicken flu nor crashing stock markets nor the return of the Chinese Government could keep these master craftsmen from working their measuring-tape magic. Suddenly, I was at the center of a storm of white chalk, straight pins and perspiration. Tang Yan Choi, a stout, tough-looking man, who -- like many of the best Chinese tailors -- claims Shanghai as his place of origin, tapped me in eight or nine places and grunted out something in Cantonese, while Raymond K. K. Kiang, the manager of the 41-year-old shop, took furious notes.</p>
        <p>''That's his secret method,'' Mr. Kiang told me. ''He reads your body.''</p>
        <p>Thirty-one measurements later, I was ready to receive Mr. Tang's assessment: my chest is full, my stomach is flat, I have a rounded right calf and I tend to wear my trousers two inches lower at the waist than I should. The hardest news to hear, though, was that my right shoulder stoops forward ever so slightly. ''But we take care of that,'' Mr. Kiang promised. ''That's why you've come to us.''</p>
        <p>If truth be told, I never really intended to come to Hong Kong at all. But when my girlfriend, Ruth Kennison, arrived home one December night ecstatic over a two-for-one  Super Saver package on Cathay Pacific Airways for $999 -- one week, hotel included -- we set our sights on Asia. We knew that the handover of the former British territory to the Chinese, combined with the general economic crisis in Southeast Asia, has not been kind to Hong Kong. Tourism is down sharply, several banks have collapsed, unemployment is rising, and real estate development is virtually stalled. But the city's problems can be a boon, albeit a bittersweet one, for American visitors. And shopkeepers, we believed, would probably be glad to have eager customers like us.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, shortly after checking into our plain room at the vast, modern Regal Riverside Hotel in the New Territories, we set out for the city's fabled shopping districts, calculator in hand, to see if the gods of retail still smile on this crowded little megalopolis on the South China Sea.</p>
        <p>If you work your way to the end of Hollywood Road in Central, past the curio shops selling vintage foot-binding shoes and Maoist insignia badges, past the high-end antiques dealers with their $20,000 Ching Dynasty bowls and $100,000 jade rats, past the weather-worn Man Mo Temple where three-foot-long coils of incense smolder for weeks on end, you'll arrive at a dusty, packed-to-the-rafters shop, right next to the coffin factory, called Wing Tei Curios and Carvings. Peter Lee, the smiling proprietor, will tell you that the wooden grates, doors and archways, with their impossibly intricate pastoral scenes and screaming dragons, were salvaged from Buddhist and Taoist shrines built before the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's. The objects now range in price from $25 to more than you can believe. Two browsing antiques dealers from San Francisco said they buy these pieces by the boatload because the quality of the craftsmanship simply does not exist anymore.</p>
        <p>Luckily, by that point on our trek down Hong Kong's wallet-clobbering antiques row, we had come to our senses. Hollywood Road, we realized, has a supernatural effect on one's shopping impulses. Things we never realized we wanted suddenly began looking like must-have objects: the lacquered cricket cage at the antique bird-cage shop around the corner at 55A Peel Street; the handpainted snuff bottles at True Arts and Curios at 89-91 Hollywood Road; the grimacing Chinese puppets from nearby Arch Angel Antiques (we bought one for $45, after some haggling), not to mention the dried shark fins, wall-sized propaganda posters and centuries-old opium pipes.</p>
        <p>The embroidered Chinese baby hats finally brought us to our knees. Upstairs at Windsor House, nearby on Po Hing Fong, we knelt before a chest full of them, convincing ourselves that a tiny hand-sewn cap shaped like a puffer fish or a Bengal tiger was exactly the life-affirming, home-altering purchase we needed to take back to Los Angeles. Plus, they were marked down from $200 each to $40, so how could we refuse? We carefully picked four, handed over our money to the expatriate British owner, Beatrice Owen, and walked away, giving ourselves high-fives on what we thought was the deal of the century.</p>
        <p>Heading up the stairs to W. W. Chan's became a morning ritual during our weeklong stay. Mr. Kiang said he needed to see me each day for fittings, and now Ruth, who  became jealous watching me get so much attention, was in the adjoining room at Irene Fashions, Chan's women's division, having a jacket made. She had brought a favorite blazer to have copied, but Tommy Liu, the tailor at Irene's, placed the jacket on a chair, winked and quickly sketched a garment that put Ruth's Donna Karan blazer to shame. The sketched version was tapered and pleated in all the right places (as well it should be, for $560), and soon Ruth was being lassoed by Tommy's tape measure.</p>
        <p>Over on the Chan side, I was having heart palpitations. Like most upscale shops, W. W. Chan's had not lowered its prices when we were there; and we did not try to negotiate. The dark cashmere-and-wool suit they had whipped up overnight, and which, at $875, would be the most expensive garment I'd ever purchased, still had chalk-marked lapels, no lining, no buttons, pins everywhere and only one sleeve. Mr. Tang, friendly as ever, poked and tapped me unceremoniously, while Mr. Kiang politely reminded me to return the following morning.</p>
        <p>With my first bespoke suit under construction, I felt I needed a few great-fitting shirts to go with it. I walked two blocks to David's Shirts, a place my Uncle Sam visited years ago and had spoken about with  reverence, and soon the measuring game was happening all over again. As with every custom-made garment, there were endless and perplexing questions: French paneled pleats or flat? Spread collar or point? And should the shirt be made of poplin or gingham, or maybe crepe de chine? I settled on Sea Island cotton -- one white, one blue, one checked. At $90 and up, I only hoped the shirts would absorb the sweat when I got the credit card bill.</p>
        <p>A 10-minute walk away, nearer to Victoria Harbor, is Granville Road, Hong Kong's answer to Filene's Basement. It was Sale Week, a twice-annual buyer's bacchanal, and everywhere rabid shoppers, mostly locals, were scavenging through sidewalk bins for cut-rate Tommy Hilfiger overruns and imitation Prada bags. But since neither of us was particularly desperate for a ''Rotex'' watch, we thought we'd save our money for the more authentic goods.</p>
        <p>In the late afternoon, we took a 15-minute double-decker bus ride inland to the madness that is the bazaar district. Promptly at 6 P.M. on Temple Street, a thousand dai pai dong -- market stands -- magically materialized. Hawkers with their rickety card tables gridlocked the street, selling everything imaginable: Little Mermaid bubble watches, ginseng tinctures, $800 abalone meat, whistling laser pointers, snake soup.  While true bargains could be found on Temple Street (we saw chenille turtlenecks for $3), the more interesting, exotic part of the night market was on adjacent Market Street, where amateur opera singers, fortune tellers and sidewalk feng shui masters set up shop. I thought about getting a belt made there by an ancient-looking streetside cobbler, but the river of people wouldn't let me stand still long enough.</p>
        <p>Wo On Lane is a perfect Hong Kong street. The dead-end alley in the Central district near trendy Lan Kwai Fong Street, off D'Aguilar Street, crams more into several hundred feet than most cities squeeze into an entire downtown. It is best to arrive, as we did the following day, around noon, when it's most active. On the corner, a sidewalk barber cut hair with a straight-edge under a makeshift sun canopy. Across the street, a Chinese herbalist offered his services next to a modern stationery store. At number 12 1/2, there was a yuppie (they're called chuppies here) jazz bar. At No. 14, a Vietnamese restaurant called Papillon was bookended between a Cuban cigar shop and an old-fashioned refrigerator repair place. The block ends at a Taoist Earth God shrine, and the whole lane smells faintly of incense.</p>
        <p>One of the more intriguing shops in Hong Kong is also there. Mountain Folkcraft, at No. 12, specializes in handmade arts and crafts, new and old, from all over Asia: Tibetan chests, Mongolian horses, Silk Road batik, paddle-shaped Chinese wooden cake molds, intricately carved with deeply set images of cuttlefish, lotus flowers and Buddhas (we bought four for $40 each), tribal costumes, musical instruments, folk toys, jewelry and, much to our satisfaction, embroidered Chinese baby hats, slightly more expensive than our steals on Hollywood Road. The women who run the store are friendly and knowledgeable, and prices are fixed, a rarity in a city where prices are negotiable on everything -- especially now.</p>
        <p>Leaving Wo On, we descended into the soul of old Hong Kong. Under the row of ragged tenements on Pottinger Street, a steep and crowded alleyway crammed with hawker's stalls, we saw live frogs for sale in mesh bags, and hair ribbons available for the equivalent of a penny. It was hard to fathom that some of the world's highest retail rents are just around the corner on Pedder Street. We plowed past the jackhammers and delivery scooters to Shanghai Tang at 12 Pedder Street, unquestionably the hippest store in town. If Hong Kong's economy is suffering, it wasn't evident here. Tourists and Hong Kongers alike were snatching up every Suzie Wong jacket and satin samfu shirt. The $35 dim sum watch we bought features a knife and fork pointing to pork buns and steamed dumplings. Our $45 Deng Xiaoping alarm clock shows the Communist leader smoking away the hours.  After Shanghai Tang, I felt as if I'd done enough shopping for a lifetime, but Ruth forged on, tackling all nine floors of the adjoining Pedder Building, a bargain-hunter's nirvana where shops have names like Labels Plus and Sample Sale Warehouse.  Miraculously, she emerged without any shopping bags, and aside from a few discoveries -- the Ann Klein II outlet and chic Blanc de Chine store among them -- she seemed more impressed by the stairway Buddhist shrines.</p>
        <p>We felt a touch of sadness heading over to Chan's that final afternoon to pick up our suit and jacket. Even in our shopping stupor, it was impossible to ignore the depth of Hong Kong's distress. The week we were there, another major investment bank, Peregrine Investments Holdings, collapsed. The upcoming Chinese New Year was looking bleak without the prospect of fresh chicken for traditional feasts, as the territory's chickens had been slaughtered to impede the spread of a flu virus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiang helped me into my wonderful new suit jacket, but even he couldn't contain his uncertainty this time. ''Business is not so good,'' he said. ''Next generation of tailors is not being trained, and I wonder if business can last much longer.'' Traditional tailoring houses like Chan's, where all the work is done on the premises, are rapidly being replaced by less exacting shops, which send out garments piecemeal to factories in mainland China. Of course, a proud man like Mr. Kiang would never permit such an arrangement.</p>
        <p>He handed me his business card with two hands, as is the Chinese tradition, and promised he would visit the United States twice a year for new suit fittings and to make alterations on this one. Ruth joined me in her new chocolate brown outfit, and both of us, dizzy from a week on the streets, said goodbye to our tailors and to Hong Kong itself -- pondering, as we would a Zen riddle,  how a ''Super Saver'' vacation could have cost so much money.</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Cathay Pacific's Super Saver deal is no longer available, but its new $999 30-day All-Asia Pass ($899 if you go through its Web site, www.cathay-usa.com), which is in effect through the end of the year, includes round-trip economy class service from New York or Los Angeles to Hong Kong with stops allowed in 17 additional Asian cities.  For a brochure, call (800) 228-4297. Reservations: (800) 233-2742.</p>
        <p>Lodging</p>
        <p>The Regal Riverside, (852) 2649-7878, fax (852) 2637-4748, is on Tai Chung Kiu Road in Shatin. Doubles are $265, tax included.</p>
        <p>Shopping</p>
        <p>David's Shirts at 33 Kimberley Road,  (852) 2367-9556, and W. W. Chan and Sons and Irene Fashions, at Burlington House, 94 Nathan Road, (852) 2367-5588, are in the heart of the Golden Mile tourist district in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong. (There is another branch of David's Shirts at the Mandarin Hotel, and another branch of Irene's at 86-90 Wellington Street in Central.) Shirts at David's range from $85 to $300. Men's suits at Chan's range from $650 to $2,000. Women's suits at Irene's start at $750. Luckily, the place with the best foreign exchange rate in town is there: City Foreign Exchange, near the back of Chungking Mansion arcade at 36-44 Nathan Road.</p>
        <p>We received about 7.7 Hong Kong dollars to $1 (the rate is now $7.11 Hong Kong to the dollar). All the shops we visited took major credit cards, but payment in American dollars was not generally accepted.</p>
        <p>Hollywood Road, in Central, is Hong Kong's antiques row. Arch Angel Antiques is at number 49-51, (852) 2851-6828; Wing Tei Curios is at No. 190F, (852) 2547-4755. Windsor House is at 10-18 Po Hing Fong,  (852) 2850-7813. Mountain Folk Craft is at 12 Wo On Lane, (852) 2523-2817; Shanghai Tang is at 12 Pedder Street, (852) 2525-7333.</p>
