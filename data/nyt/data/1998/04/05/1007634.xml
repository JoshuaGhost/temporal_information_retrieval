        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''I'm a Stay-at-Home-Mom. Please Hold the Applause'' (From the Desk Of, March 22), in which the mother of a 4-month-old boy said that she was not happy with what she called ''my predicament'':</p>
        <p>I am an accountant, but I am also a stay-at-home mom. And I am thrilled with my situation.</p>
        <p>I found the author's comment that she and her son ''don't share the same interests right now'' astonishing. My daughter, Alexandra, is 21 months old and we do share the same interest -- namely, Alexandra. Child-rearing is not just about having fun with your kids. It is more about teaching them your values, educating them about the kind of people they want to be and helping them pursue their dreams. In short, it is not about us; it is about them.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of research showing that the bonds a baby forges with others are of utmost importance to her survival and that this bonding must take place in the first three years of life. But this process takes time. Wanting to step in only after a baby has completed the process -- with someone else -- is misguided. A parent who does so will avoid some  difficult times but will also miss the countless moments of pure joy every parent should cherish.</p>
