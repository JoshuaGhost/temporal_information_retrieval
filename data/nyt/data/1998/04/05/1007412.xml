        <p>MICHAEL LANKESTER will lead the Hartford Symphony Orchestra in concerts at the Bushnell on Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 (with preview discussions each evening at 7). The program opens with Rossini's ''Silken Ladder'' Overture and closes with Richard Strauss's symphonic poem ''Ein Heldenleben.''</p>
        <p>In between comes a nostalgic return for Elmar Oliveira: The violinist was 14 when he won his first competition and made his debut with the Hartford Symphony; now a world-renowned soloist, he'll play the beautiful Samuel Barber Concerto. The numbers to call for tickets are (860) 246-6807 or (860) 244-2999.</p>

        <p>Free concerts can be heard at 3 o'clock today in Westport and in Danbury. Betty Jones, the operatic pride of Wilton, takes her one-woman show to the Westport Library: Shirley Land, a member of the sponsoring group, Friends of the Wilton Library, says the singer ''bounces from opera and musical comedy to sophisticated jazz, mingling humor and satire, and her opera antics will create pure joy.''</p>
        <p>An all-Beethoven program can be heard today at 3 o'clock in Ives Hall, Danbury, where James Humphreville will lead the Danbury Symphony in the Leonore Overture No. 3, the ''Pastoral'' Symphony (No. 6) and, with Alex Romanov the guest soloist, the D Major Violin Concerto.</p>
        <p>In Battell Chapel at Yale, at 4 this afternoon, Fenno Heath, who has found more time to devote to composition since he retired as director of the Yale Glee Club, presides at the piano in a recital of his songs written for, and sung by, Judith Caldwell and Kyle Pruett. Ward Davenny, the pianist and longtime Yale faculty member, will also take part.</p>
        <p>Also on today's roster are three programs designed for younger listeners. At 1 and 3 o'clock, Annie and the Natural Wonder Band hold forth at the Quick Center for the Arts, Fairfield University. It is described as a multimedia production featuring dancing gorillas, penguins and honeybees.</p>
        <p>''The Snow Queen'' reigns today at Jorgensen Auditorium, University of Connecticut in Storrs. Hans Christian Andersen's tale of friendship, fantasy and the power of love is sparked by an original score and lively characters created by the very big puppets of Das Puppenspiel Theater. Performances are at 1, 3 and 5 P.M.</p>
        <p>The Chamber Music Society at Yale brings many world-renowned ensembles to New Haven, but once a year it asks the Music School faculty to select outstanding student groups to give a concert at Sprague Memorial Hall. Tuesday evening at 7, the young players convene to present the Hindemith Wind Quintet as well as Piano Trios by Beethoven, Ravel and Shostakovich (203) 432-4158.</p>
        <p>The Fidelio Trio (the violist Lois Martin, the cellist Harry Clark and the pianist Sanda Schuldmann), in its 10th year as ensemble in residence at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, has planned an ambitious program for 7 P.M. on Wednesday. The free event, called ''Patrons Past and Present,'' will present readings from letters and employment documents of Bach, Haydn and Beethoven, which may put their scores into intriguing historical context. The event will also include the world premiere of a piece commissioned from faculty composer Steve Evans (203) 281-8730).</p>
        <p>Susan Quigley-Duggan had to postpone her faculty concert at the University of Connecticut last February, but the rescheduled program goes on Saturday afternoon at 3 in von der Mehden Hall, Storrs. With the assistance of the clarinetist Thomas Labadorf and a pianist to be announced, the soprano sings Schubert's ''Shepherd on the Rock,'' along with arias and songs of Handel, Bizet, Duparc, Delibes, Ernest Charles and Roger Quilter (860 486-2260).</p>
        <p>Aficionados of the unusual will find it on display 8 P.M. Friday at the World Music Hall, Wesleyan University, as the visiting artist Lauren Paul gives a concert of South Indian classical dance, assisted by several undergraduate performers; next door, in Crowell Hall, a free senior recital will be taking place at the same time, with Daniel Gilbert and Jessie Torrisi moving from American experimental music to percussion pieces from the Cameroon (860) 685-3355.</p>
        <p>Finally, performances of ''A Chorus Line'' are taking place on Friday and Saturday. Eight o'clock is curtain time both evenings (203) 325-4466.</p>
