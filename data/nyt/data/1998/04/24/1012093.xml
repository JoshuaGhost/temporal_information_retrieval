        <p>THEY are opening Yankee Stadium again tonight, which should produce surging emotions in all Yankee fans.</p>
        <p>The stadium is always a place of brooding memories, what with the monuments and the gloomy legacy of Gehrig and Ruth and Howard and Martin and Mantle, who passed before their time.</p>
        <p>The big ball yard in the Bronx has survived the 500-pound expansion joint that plummeted into empty seats 11 days ago, but its future is endangered. The projectile has opened the debate on whether the Yankees should move to a new stadium or live with a refurbished old one.</p>
        <p>It is no small marvel to me how typically New York this debate has become, with strong opinions and emotions and fears and preconceptions flying around like batting-practice home runs, sounding great in an empty ball park, but a bit premature.</p>
        <p>The day after the roof fell in, I wrote that the broken joint would guarantee George Steinbrenner some action quicker than he could have imagined. A West Sider told a friend of mine that I had gone over to the other side -- baseball owners and luxury-box fops and servile public officials -- that I had come down in favor of a billion-dollar ball park. I did not. All I want to do is raise a few questions about our relationship to sport:</p>
        <p>1. Does Manhattan need a ball park on the West Side? I love the new retro ball parks that have revitalized the fringes of downtown Baltimore and Cleveland, which, by the way, gravely needed the boost. However, I drive and walk around Manhattan, currently flush with tourists and locals, bright lights and good food. Does the city need another very expensive corner, at great cost to all of us?</p>
        <p>2. Shouldn't we worry about a Mayor who wears Yankee emblems? I always thought it was reassuring when Mayor Koch vanished in the third inning on opening day. In his zeal to build a new pleasure palace for a devious bully like Steinbrenner, is Mayor Giuliani thinking with his pinstriped heart rather than with his prosecuting-attorney's head?</p>
        <p>3. Why is there less civic revulsion to the city's cooperating with Fred Wilpon, who unveiled his plans for a new stadium in Flushing yesterday? Because the co-owner of the Mets has promised to pay for some of it, and because his image is impeccable.</p>
        <p>4. What are our priorities? Ken Trell, the assistant principal at my old school, Jamaica High, was born in the Bronx and loves the Yankees, but he would rather the city buy even more computers for its youth. He said: ''Technology is the future. Under supervision, the kids could teach each other computer skills in their leisure time. Our greatest resource is not being tapped.'' Meanwhile, of course, schools and hospitals and bridges and tunnels are falling apart.</p>
        <p>5. Should we be afraid to dream? Our collective nostalgia mourns for the old Metropolitan Opera, the old Penn Station, the old Ebbets Field, the old Polo Grounds. But when I walk through Lincoln Center on a sparkling winter night, I'm glad somebody dreamed of that campus of dreams. I'm all for stopping Trump from building Brasilia on our skyline, but let's litigate one case at a time.</p>
        <p>6. Would Steinbrenner want to become a pariah in the city by moving to New Jersey? The New Jersey taxpayers and Governor seem to be dubious of supporting him. Should not the Mayor address this publicly?</p>
        <p>7. In a sane world, even with a budget surplus, should any city spend its resources for millionaire owners and players? And make no mistake: whatever money goes to build luxury boxes and other amenities, the players' salaries and ticket prices and cable profits will only go up. And we pay.</p>
        <p>8. Would a new West Side stadium create ultimate gridlock? It would certainly encourage people to walk in from trains, subways, buses, office buildings, even potential ferries from New Jersey. And it might seem an improvement to the poor souls who now get stuck on the Deegan, Triboro and George Washington whenever there is a Yankee game.</p>
        <p>9. What's wrong with Yankee Stadium? Not much for the real fan, who just wants to see a game. I hate to break the news to you, but real fans are a minor consideration these days. There is money to be made serving white wine and shrimp to yuppies in luxury boxes. Still, Steinbrenner and the city have done their best. The stadium is clean and safe -- and historic and beautiful and awesome. It is also a 1970's response to a 1920's creation, now facing the next century. Something's going to change.</p>
        <p>10. Before we make up our minds, can't we discuss all this?</p>
