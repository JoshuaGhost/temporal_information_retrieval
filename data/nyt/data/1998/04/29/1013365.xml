        <p>Live by the bullpen, die by the bullpen.</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive game, in different cities, the Mets squandered a 3-1, ninth-inning lead and lost to the Houston Astros tonight, 4-3.</p>
        <p>One inning after John Franco had surrendered a pair of ninth-inning runs, John Hudek allowed a no-out bases-loaded single over a drawn-in outfield to Sean Berry to deal the mets their third consecutive loss.</p>
        <p>Time and again, the Met offense could not capitalize on opportunities. And Franco has had two of the toughest days a reliever can imagine. On Monday in New York, the Mets' closer allowed three ninth-inning runs for his first blown save of the season. Tonight at the Astrodome, Franco allowed two more ninth-inning runs to blow his second save opportunity after opening the season 5 for 5.</p>
        <p>Even the first two hitters Franco faced were the same: Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell. Both reached base. Both scored. And the Mets eventually lost a game the way they usually win them -- coming from behind, in one-run fashion -- for the second game in a row.</p>
        <p>''I've been playing for a long time; I'm not going to get down on myself,'' said Franco, the 37-year-old veteran who has recorded 364 saves, more than any other left-hander in major league history. ''I'm just saying, let's get it all out of the way now.''</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive day, the Mets carried a 3-1 lead into the ninth. On the heels of a strong eight-inning outing by Rick Reed, Al Leiter pitched six and a third shutout innings to extend his scoreless streak to 20 1/3 -- three short of his career best.</p>
        <p>Leiter, who had to escape from harm in just about every inning, called his outing the best he has ever had in the this dome; he allowed six hits, walked four, struck out six and lowered his earned run average to a stingy 1.15. But after 121 grueling pitches, Leiter finally needed a little help from the bullpen to free himself from danger.</p>
        <p>Greg McMichael came on in the seventh inning with one out and the bases loaded and struck out Berry and Moises Alou to end the threat. Dennis Cook surrendered an eighth-inning run, but with Mel Rojas pitching and runners on first and third, Tim Spehr gunned down Tim Bogar trying to steal second to end another Houston threat.</p>
        <p>Through eight innings, the Astros had stranded 12 runners, 8 of them in scoring position. On came Franco in the ninth, a little over 24 hours after a 23-pitch outing he would love to forget.</p>
        <p>He will undoubtedly want to forget this one, too. On his first three pitches, Bell and Bagwell delivered back-to-back singles (for Bell, it was his first career hit against Franco). Then, after fighting back from a 3-0 count to make it full, Franco hit Berry with a pitch to load the bases.</p>
        <p>Out came Valentine to calm Franco down. But Alou singled up the middle on Franco's first pitch past second baseman Luis Lopez's outstretched glove, and the score was tied at 3-3. All the good work Leiter had done was lost.</p>
        <p>Franco could have given up right there. ''But he didn't crumble,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Franco struck out pinch-hitter Dave Clark for the first out. Then, after issuing an intentional walk to Ricky Gutierrez to reload the bases, Franco struck out Brad Ausmus and pinch-hitter Jack Howell to strand three more Houston runners.</p>
        <p>But the damage was already done. The Mets went quickly in the 10th. Valentine sent Hudek, who had been extremely sharp his last two times out, in the hopes of buying an inning, before going to Turk Wendell, who could give the Mets more than one. Later, Valentine thought he should have sent Wendell out first.</p>
        <p>It never made went that far. Hudek, a former Astro, walked Bogar, Bell reached on an infield hit and Bagwell walked after falling behind 0-2. Berry singled to deep center on a 1-2 pitch to drive Bogar home.</p>
        <p>Valentine would not second-guess himself on his decision to send Franco out for the ninth instead of Rojas.</p>
        <p>''John has 300-plus career saves,'' Valentine said. ''He's also had a lot of blown saves. This is nothing new for him. This isn't something that he won't come back from.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>PAUL WILSON is scheduled to fly to New York on Wednesday night and remain with the Mets for most of their coming homestand to begin a throwing program with the Mets' pitching coach, BOB APODACA, and the organization's pitching coordinator, DAVE WALLACE. Wilson has been playing catch for the last two weeks, since a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed a small bone spur in the back of his right elbow. By the end of his time in New York, Wilson might progress to throwing off a mound. . . . The Mets will make up their April 13 rainout in Milwaukee with a twilight-night doubleheader at County Stadium on July 22.</p>
