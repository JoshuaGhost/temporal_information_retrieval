        <p>Colombian Rights Lawyer Killed  A top human rights lawyer in Colombia was shot and killed, the authorities said.

        <p>Sudan Appeals For Famine Aid  The Sudanese Government appealed to humanitarian organizations for food and medicine for parts of southern Sudan that are facing famine. Two days earlier, the United Nations' food operation accused the Government of hampering efforts to feed 350,000 people in the south. The Government apparently has been concerned that aid supplies were falling to insurgents.</p>

        <p>A Record Backlog Delays Naturalization  More than two million immigrants throughout the country are waiting to become citizens of the United States, the largest backlog of naturalization applications since the Federal Government began keeping those records at the turn of the century. The backlog means that for those people in the pipeline -- legal residents of the United States who, for the most part, have already waited five years for the right to apply -- the waiting time for citizenship is up to 18 months, immigration officials said. Before the backlog started increasing in 1996, the normal waiting time was 6 months.</p>

        <p>Universities Are Criticized  The acclaimed research universities of the United States are shortchanging their undergraduate students, particularly freshmen, according to an unusually candid report from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, one of the nation's leading education-policy organizations. The report said that universities had consigned undergraduates to classes taught by graduate assistants and failed to provide students with ''a coherent body of knowledge'' by the time they graduated.</p>

        <p>Arrest Reveals a Secret Life  Palm Beach society has been rattled by the arrest late last week of William Stephen Martin, who was taken into custody on 19-year-old warrants from Massachusetts charging him with the 1979 abduction of his two daughters, Lisa, at top, and Rachel, who were 2 and 4 years old, respectively, at the time. The police said the girls believed that their mother was dead. The authorities also said that wasn't the only lie that Mr. Martin had told; they said his name is not William Stephen Martin.</p>

        <p>Zenith Plans More Layoffs  Zenith said it would lay off 388 workers at its suburban Chicago television picture tube plant as it struggles to compete against cheaper Japanese television sets. The layoffs add to 409 dismissals that the company, based in Glenview, Ill., announced earlier this month. The nearly 800 workers will be let go from Zenith's Melrose Park plant, which analysts expect will eventually close or be sold. Zenith has reported only one profitable quarter since 1985.</p>

        <p>Kites Fit for a Flea  The first World's Smallest Kite competition was held in Seattle over the weekend, its goal to ''find the tiniest flyable kite on the planet.'' Hiko Yoshizumi of Kyoto, Japan, won with his 10-millimeter-by-8-millimeter sode kite, shown with a penny to provide perspective. Mr. Yoshizumi's kite will be submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
