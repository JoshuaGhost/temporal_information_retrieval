        <p>Houston Astros defeat New York Mets, 4-3; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Usually, it is the Mets who come from behind. Usually, it is the Mets who win one-run games. But yesterday afternoon at Shea Stadium, the Mets did neither. John Franco, who had not allowed a run in seven prior appearances, let a two-run ninth-inning lead slip away as the Houston Astros rallied for a 4-3 victory. The defeat was the first a Met reliever has been charged with this season.</p>
        <p>Franco had been brilliant, having not allowed an earned run in eight previous innings while going five for five in save opportunities. But the 37-year-old left-hander walked Derek Bell, who is hitless in seven career at-bats against Franco, to lead off the ninth. And one batter later, Franco walked the left-handed-hitting Bill Spiers to load the bases after having a one-ball, two-strike count.</p>

        <p>Usually, it is the Mets who come from behind. Usually, it is the Mets who win one-run games. But yesterday afternoon at Shea Stadium, the Mets did neither. John Franco, who had not allowed a run in seven prior appearances, let a two-run ninth-inning lead slip away as the Houston Astros rallied for a 4-3 victory. The defeat was the first a Met reliever has been charged with this season.</p>
        <p>Franco had been brilliant, having not allowed an earned run in eight previous innings while going five for five in save opportunities. But the 37-year-old left-hander walked Derek Bell, who is hitless in seven career at-bats against Franco, to lead off the ninth. And one batter later, Franco walked the left-handed-hitting Bill Spiers to load the bases after having a one-ball, two-strike count.</p>
        <p>Both walks were turned into runs, with Spiers's run, the game-winner, coming on Tony Eusebio's two-out double to right.</p>
        <p>The announced crowd of 17,656 -- which appeared much closer to 1,765 for a makeup game of last Thursday's rainout -- showered Franco with boos after the top of the ninth was over. ''They had a right to boo today,'' Franco said. ''I didn't do my job.''</p>
        <p>Franco added that he was more upset with his not being able to save the victory for Rick Reed.</p>
        <p>Reed pitched eight brilliant innings, did not allow a hit through the first four or a run through the first seven, and departed after 87 pitches with a 3-1 lead. The first two of the Mets' runs came on Jim Tatum's third career home run, his second in five days.</p>
        <p>Tatum was making his second major league start in left field hours after a magnetic resonance imaging test on Bernard Gilkey's left elbow revealed a small stress fracture. Gilkey, one of the few Mets who has been hitting this season, was placed on the 15-day disabled list. But the Mets responded by banging out 10 hits against the Houston left-hander Mike Hampton.</p>
        <p>Tatum's fourth-inning blast, which clanged above the team's retired uniform numbers in left, snapped Hampton's string of 24 consecutive scoreless innings against the Mets dating to last May 13.</p>
        <p>And Tatum, who was making just his sixth career appearance in left field, then singled off Hampton to open the sixth. Rich Becker pinch-ran and took third on a hard-hit double by Carlos Baerga, just his second hit this season batting right-handed.</p>
        <p>One out later, Becker scored on a Rey Ordonez sacrifice fly that Bell ran down.</p>
        <p>The Mets went 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position. But even though Reed allowed a run in the eighth on a Carl Everett double and a Jack Howell pinch-hit double one out later, the 3-1 lead seemed secure with Franco coming into the game. It was the first time this season Franco had pitched with more than a one-run lead and just the second time in a week that Franco had pitched at all.</p>
        <p>He responded by walking Bell on five pitches and then Jeff Bagwell singled up the middle. Next came the nine-pitch walk to Spiers, who had fouled off three 3-2 pitches in a row. Moises Alou followed with a sacrifice fly to center. And it was 3-2 with only one out.</p>
        <p>Up came pinch-hitter Richard Hidalgo, who hit a perfectly placed ball of the end of the bat. John Olerud couldn't get to it, so Luis Lopez had to cover a lot of ground to make the play. But Lopez's throw did not get to Franco at first in time and the bases were loaded once again.</p>
        <p>Ricky Gutierrez followed with a sacrifice fly to right to tie the score, then Eusebio doubled in the go-ahead run. Hidalgo was thrown out at the plate by Butch Huskey to end the inning. But by then, it was a couple of batters too late.</p>
        <p>''Those walks just hurt,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>''You knew it was going to happen sometime,'' the pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, said of Franco's inability to record a save for the first time this season. ''Not too many people are perfect for the year. But you just hate to lose a ball game when you feel like you've outpitched, outhit and outplayed the other team and then you let it slip away at the end.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BERNARD GILKEY said he knew something was wrong with his elbow, which he initially injured while swinging on April 10. ''I thought it was just strained and that we'd have to pump a little cortisone in there,'' said Gilkey, whose .314 average is second among regulars on the team. Instead, Gilkey was placed on the disabled list retroactive to April 26. To take Gilkey's spot on the roster, CRAIG PAQUETTE's contract was purchased from Class AAA Norfolk. And to make room for Paquette on the 40-man roster, TODD HUNDLEY was transferred to the 60-day disabled list, retroactive to March 31. ''Bernard is an important part of our offense,'' General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said. ''But I expect him back at the end of 15 days.''</p>
