        <p>A permanent home for the Academy Awards show has been announced by Mayor Richard J. Riordan and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
        <p>The 3,300-seat theater, designed by the New York architect David Rockwell, is to be in the heart of Hollywood, on Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. It is part of a $350 million development project by the TrizecHahn Corporation that is to include restaurants and retail stores. Groundbreaking is scheduled for this summer, although the complex does not have all the permits it needs to go forward. Mayor Riordan said he hoped the new theater would be ready by 2001.</p>

        <p>A permanent home for the Academy Awards show has been announced by Mayor Richard J. Riordan and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
        <p>The 3,300-seat theater, designed by the New York architect David Rockwell, is to be in the heart of Hollywood, on Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. It is part of a $350 million development project by the TrizecHahn Corporation that is to include restaurants and retail stores. Groundbreaking is scheduled for this summer, although the complex does not have all the permits it needs to go forward. Mayor Riordan said he hoped the new theater would be ready by 2001.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud to welcome the Academy Awards back to their birthplace, he said on Thursday at a news conference at the Hollywood Roosevelt, where the academy had its first awards dinner on May 16, 1929. He added: ''Hollywood is not just back. It's better.''</p>
        <p>Since their founding, the Academy Awards have had no permanent site, switching in recent years between the Shrine Auditorium, near the University of Southern California campus, in South-Central Los Angeles, and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles. Academy officials said there was a possibility that the new theater would also be used for theatrical shows like Broadway musicals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rockwell's company, the Rockwell Group, is known for its entertainment architecture and the notion of architecture as theater. Clients have included Disney, Sony, Radio City Music Hall and the Bronx Zoo and restaurants like Nobu, Vong and the Monkey Bar.</p>
        <p>The Hollywood Boulevard area, once glamorous, has been crumbling in recent years, resembling the Times Square area in the 1970's and 80's before its recent redevelopment.  Los Angeles officials have pointed to $1 billion in planned development in Hollywood as part of the effort to revive the area. They say the Academy Awards theater is a further sign of that planned revival.</p>
        <p>''This is a historic day, the beginning of a new era in Hollywood history,'' Robert Rehme, president of the academy, said shortly after the announcement.</p>
        <p>Although more city approvals are needed, Mr. Riordan and Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the area, said that they expected no major opposition.</p>
