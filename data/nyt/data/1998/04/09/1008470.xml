        <p>The Government will propose on Thursday that bright cartoonlike labels be required in smaller sport utility vehicles, warning that the vehicles can tip over and kill the occupants.</p>
        <p>People in sport utility vehicles are three and a half times more likely to die in rollovers than people in mid-sized cars, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
        <p>One proposed label shows a figure being thrown out of the passenger-side window of a sport utility vehicle as the vehicle flips onto its right side; the label also shows the image of a seat belt being buckled. In between the two images, the label says, ''Warning,'' in white on a bright red background, and, in yellow on black, ''Higher Rollover Risk. Always Buckle Up.''</p>
        <p>The traffic safety agency has required warning labels since 1986, but experts say they are not very effective. Only text is displayed on those labels, which one official called ''astonishingly verbose.''</p>
        <p>The proposal is for sport utility vehicles with a wheelbase of 110 inches or less, including models like the Jeep Cherokee and Chevy Blazer. Such vehicles have a higher center of gravity, making them less stable.</p>
        <p>Safety officials say another part of the danger is the drivers, who are less likely to wear seat belts than car passengers are and are more likely to drink and to drive fast.</p>
        <p>''Some people think the vehicle, because it is bigger and heavier, makes them somehow invulnerable,'' said Philip R. Recht, deputy administrator of the agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Recht said that 60 percent of rollover deaths in sport utility vehicles occurred when someone was ejected and that if drivers and passengers wore belts, few such ''ejections'' would occur. Mr. Recht said 85 percent of rollover deaths -- of which there are about 9,000 a year -- involved people not wearing seat belts.</p>
        <p>The new label designs, he said, grew out of his agency's research on warning labels for air bags. Pictures and bright colors are much more effective than text alone, he said.</p>
        <p>Sport utility vehicles are more than twice as prone to deadly rollovers as the average vehicle, according to the highway agency's statistics. From 1991 through 1994, for every million registered sport utility vehicles, there were 98 rollover deaths a year; the rate for small pickups was 93; for standard pickups, 59; for small cars, 47; for medium cars, 28; and for large cars, 19.</p>
        <p>Minivans sometimes have a center of gravity even higher than sport utilities, but they had only 40 rollover deaths per million vehicles.</p>
        <p>Safety groups have asked the highway safety agency to publish model-by-model data on the tendency of rollover and to make the data available to car shoppers.</p>
        <p>Consumers Union, the nonprofit group that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, has petitioned the agency to write a rollover standard, much the way it has standards for front-end collisions. The auto industry has opposed such ideas, arguing that rollover deaths are largely a matter of driver behavior, not vehicle design.</p>
        <p>Leon S. Robertson, a lecturer on automotive safety at Yale University, said he doubted that warnings about the danger of sharp turns would make much difference.</p>
        <p>''What happens is people get in an emergency situation and they make a sharp turn,'' Mr. Robertson said.</p>
        <p>He also said a study in Utah had found that two-thirds of its auto accident survivors with spinal injuries were in vehicles that rolled over.</p>
        <p>''There does appear to be a disproportionate number of spinal injuries,'' he said.</p>
