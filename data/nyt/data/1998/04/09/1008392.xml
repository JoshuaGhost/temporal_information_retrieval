        <p>If everyone has a figurative 15 minutes of fame, Joe Coleman's comes in the form of an 85-minute documentary film by Robert-Adrian Pejo titled ''R.I.P,'' which stands, in this case, for ''Rest in Pieces.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coleman is an unusual man, but the uncritical and padded ''R.I.P.,'' which opens today at Anthology Film Archives, is far from an extraordinary film. What it does best is illustrate the fallacy of the proposition that because someone is odd, he must be interesting.</p>
        <p>At 42, the bearded Mr. Coleman is a painter whose painstakingly detailed canvases bear the likenesses of serial killers, sideshow freaks and assorted grotesques. Viscera and pierced eyes, as well as peaceful-looking little houses, figure in his works. Mr. Coleman has a past as a performance artist who bit the heads off mice, strapped explosives to his body and was arrested by the New York City police when they saw a fish dangling from the gaping fly of his trousers. He spends a good deal of the film discussing the influences on his life: Roman Catholicism, a frightening alcoholic father, rage, love for his mother, guilt, P. T. Barnum, Harry Houdini and Tod Browning, the director of ''Freaks.'' He lists Hieronymus Bosch and Bruegel as influences on his art.</p>
        <p>Here are some of his ideas: ''This isn't a time to give birth. It's a time to die.''</p>
        <p>''Mankind as a species is similar to a cancer.''</p>
        <p>''Friends who are dead will never abandon you.''</p>
        <p>''I am Jesus. I am the Antichrist. I am both.''</p>
        <p>No longer married, Mr. Coleman lives alone in an apartment with his ''big, close happy family,'' which includes Junior, ''my adopted kid,'' a deformed embryo pickled in a jar, and similar specimens. They, he observes, have ''never betrayed or abandoned me.''</p>
        <p>His ex-wife, ex-girlfriend, a psychiatrist and a true-crime writer speak well of him, and the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch engages Mr. Coleman in some banter about religion. The exchanges, like Mr. Coleman's visit to Hasil Adkins, the rockabilly musician who provides much of the lively score for ''R.I.P,'' serve only to extend a film that might more wisely have used its running time to provide some dispassionate critical assessment of Mr. Coleman's work.</p>
        <p>Like the critics, collectors of his paintings, which he says are sold from a waiting list, are conspicuous by their absence from ''R.I.P.''</p>
        <p>R.I.P  Rest in Pieces: A Portrait of Joe Coleman</p>
        <p>Directed and edited by Robert-Adrian Pejo; written by Walt Michelson; director of photography, Wolfgang Lehner; music by Hasil Adkins, Charlie Feathers, Link Wray, Wanda Jackson and A.O.; produced by Michael Seeber and Heinz Stussak. At the Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue at Second Street, East Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Joe Coleman, Hasil Adkins, Bill Coleman, Katharine Gates, Dian Hanson, Jim Jarmusch, Manuel De Landa, Nancy Pivar, Harold Schechter and Martin Wilner.</p>
