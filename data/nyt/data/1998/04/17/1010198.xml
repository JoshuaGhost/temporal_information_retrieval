      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Anthony Wilson, a young guitarist, came to the Jazz Standard on Tuesday night and did two unusual things. First, he performed with a small big band, using complicated, swinging orchestrations to surround his improvisations. And then he brought out the saxophonist Bennie Wallace to play several tunes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace, a young bright hope during the 1970's, has seemingly vanished from jazz. Mr. Wilson convened an exceptional group of musicians, including Art Baron on trombone and the saxophonists Ted Nash, Jerry Dodgion and Joe Temperley, to play his arrangements.</p>

        <p>Anthony Wilson, a young guitarist, came to the Jazz Standard on Tuesday night and did two unusual things. First, he performed with a small big band, using complicated, swinging orchestrations to surround his improvisations. And then he brought out the saxophonist Bennie Wallace to play several tunes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace, a young bright hope during the 1970's, has seemingly vanished from jazz. Mr. Wilson convened an exceptional group of musicians, including Art Baron on trombone and the saxophonists Ted Nash, Jerry Dodgion and Joe Temperley, to play his arrangements.</p>
        <p>The tunes worked with shuffle rhythms and tango rhythms, and Mr. Wilson, when he soloed, let bits of older guitar styles peek through a basically modern conception. His arrangements were historically conscious, too, with one piece borrowing from the later reed writing of Duke Ellington; he used the sound of Tadd Dameron to arrange Mr. Dameron's ''Flossie Lou.''</p>
        <p>Though the arrangements were tightly controlled, Mr. Wilson had fun calling riffs, and on tune after tune he motioned to his band to play written sections behind a soloist. Mr. Temperley, whose moist, graceful sound illuminated much of the show's improvisational space, glided through puffs of sound, and Mr. Baron sounded jubilant, ripping through the riffs.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Wallace appeared. He's an odd and angular improviser, and when he played he repeated some favorite rhythms. He moved between free playing and chordal improvisation, and after he set up phrases that jarred, he played a set of swing ideas with a soft and breathy tone that made them rich.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Wilson went into a slow blues, calling on Mr. Dodgion and Mr. Temperley to solo. He was being generous, and his generosity made the music amiable in a profound way.</p>
