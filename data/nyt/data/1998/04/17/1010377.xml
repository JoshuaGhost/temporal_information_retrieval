        <p>Editorial on violence in Algeria; notes repeated massacres in villages there are among world's worst human rights abuses, yet Algerian Govt has defied international efforts to investigate them; holds United States should call for UN to visit regularly and report on abuses</p>

        <p>More than a month has passed since the United Nations Commission on Human Rights began its annual meeting in Geneva, and no one has introduced a resolution criticizing Algeria. The repeated massacres in villages there are among the world's worst human rights abuses, yet the Algerian Government has defied international efforts to investigate them. Today is the deadline for introducing resolutions in Geneva. The United States should call for a U.N. special rapporteur on Algeria to visit regularly and report on abuses.</p>
        <p>Since the violence began in Algeria in 1992, 75,000 people have been killed, 2,000 of them in the last four months. The Government has always said the massacres were the work of Islamic fundamentalists, but it has failed to protect its citizens. This week Algerian newspapers reported that local authorities and pro-Government militia commanders had been arrested and charged with some massacres. This step is welcome, but it illustrates the need for the thorough investigation.</p>

        <p>Since the violence began in Algeria in 1992, 75,000 people have been killed, 2,000 of them in the last four months. The Government has always said the massacres were the work of Islamic fundamentalists, but it has failed to protect its citizens. This week Algerian newspapers reported that local authorities and pro-Government militia commanders had been arrested and charged with some massacres. This step is welcome, but it illustrates the need for the thorough investigation.</p>
        <p>Also this week the State Department decided against introducing a resolution, arguing that it might not pass. A vote would indeed be close, but reminding Algeria of the world's concern is the point, and that can be done even if the resolution fails. Washington's sponsorship itself would send a strong message.</p>
        <p>The State Department also maintains that overt pressure might drive Algeria to close itself off even more. But the Government is so defiant that it is hard to see how a resolution could make matters worse. Continued silence is an abandonment of Algeria's endangered people.</p>
