        <p>John Cardinal O'Connor, known about town as a Mets and Yankees fan, said he will not attend any Major League Baseball games this year because the league insisted on playing on Good Friday.</p>
        <p>''I believe that playing on Good Friday, at the very least from 12 to 3, is cheap and cheapens our culture, no matter how big the box-office receipts,'' Cardinal O'Connor wrote in his column in Catholic New York, the weekly newspaper published by the Archdiocese of New York. ''I resent it. I protest it. I will not go to a game in 1998.''</p>

        <p>John Cardinal O'Connor, known about town as a Mets and Yankees fan, said he will not attend any Major League Baseball games this year because the league insisted on playing on Good Friday.</p>
        <p>''I believe that playing on Good Friday, at the very least from 12 to 3, is cheap and cheapens our culture, no matter how big the box-office receipts,'' Cardinal O'Connor wrote in his column in Catholic New York, the weekly newspaper published by the Archdiocese of New York. ''I resent it. I protest it. I will not go to a game in 1998.''</p>
        <p>All 30 Major League clubs played on Good Friday this year. The Boston Red Sox pushed their game time back to 3 P.M. in observance of the holiday. The Red Sox game ended before 6 P.M., also giving Jews enough time to get home before sundown at 7:25 P.M., the beginning of Passover.</p>
        <p>The Cardinal said he was told that Major League Baseball officials regretted the conflict in timing, but said it was impossible to schedule the season's 2,430 games without some problems.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees had to postpone two games of a three-game series, playing the third game in the Mets' Shea Stadium!'' the Cardinal wrote in reference to problems at Yankee Stadium that will keep the ball park closed for another week. ''But teams had to play on Good Friday? Couldn't miss a single day? Even the stock market closes on Good Friday.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor is not calling for a boycott by Catholics, said Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. Rather, it is a personal protest, he said.</p>
        <p>''The Cardinal feels it was insensitive,'' Mr. Zwilling said. ''Of course baseball games are played on Sundays. The point is, Good Friday is a very sacred day for Christians and that should be acknowledged.''</p>
        <p>And if the Mets meet the Yankees in the World Series, would Cardinal O'Connor attend?</p>
        <p>''Not even the World Series,'' Mr. Zwilling said.</p>
