        <p>Navigating the West Side Highway is difficult enough under the best conditions. On Wednesday night it became downright dangerous, the police said, because three teen-agers covered the parkway's entrance, exit and street signs with posters advertising local hip-hop bands.</p>
        <p>The teen-agers were arrested, and each faces as much as a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. From the Police Department's perspective, their crime was a dangerous twist on an urban blight: the thousands of illegal and unsightly posters plastered on surfaces throughout the city.</p>

        <p>Navigating the West Side Highway is difficult enough under the best conditions. On Wednesday night it became downright dangerous, the police said, because three teen-agers covered the parkway's entrance, exit and street signs with posters advertising local hip-hop bands.</p>
        <p>The teen-agers were arrested, and each faces as much as a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. From the Police Department's perspective, their crime was a dangerous twist on an urban blight: the thousands of illegal and unsightly posters plastered on surfaces throughout the city.</p>
        <p>The police said that such posters have been applied with greater frequency to signs essential to traffic safety. But street advertising companies and cultural scholars, while not condoning the obstruction of traffic signs, said the police were fighting a losing battle against a traditional form of urban expression.</p>
        <p>The youths -- Alex Rudd, 18; Tashike Franks, 16, and Jameel Penn, 16, all of the Bronx -- were arrested near 112th Street after an off-duty police officer noticed several posters and saw the youths sprinting to the southbound side of the parkway.</p>
        <p>The officer, Capt. Robert Lucena, rushed back to the 20th Precinct and mustered a contingent of plainclothes officers. They found the suspects shortly after 9:30 P.M. The three were charged with making graffiti, possessing graffiti instruments, reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and unlawful posting of advertisements, said Wayne Brison, a spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Captain Lucena said the teen-agers told the police that they had been sent out by a man known only as ''the General,'' who canvasses local schools and promises free compact disks to students who agree to put up signs.</p>
        <p>''The posters were on every exit sign, entrance sign, street sign and light post that I came across,'' he said, ''and when the officers found them, they had about 400 posters still in their bags. This isn't just a nuisance. It's a tremendous public safety concern.''</p>
        <p>People who put up such posters said that the police have been cracking down on street advertisements across the city, handing out $50 fines and jailing offenders.</p>
        <p>James Rogers, whose company, James Rogers Inc., employs scores of people in more than 31 cities to post advertisements for bands on abandoned buildings and construction sites, said he had hired a legal team to deal with the multitude of summonses his workers receive. He said his employees do not post fliers on street signs or on buildings where there have been complaints.</p>
        <p>''In many ways the police do damage here, because they arrest people who post on standard sites that if kept up can be beautiful,'' he said. ''I really don't see what the purpose is here. They aren't going to stop it, because there are thousands of people doing it.''</p>
        <p>Those who study urban culture say that street advertisements have been part of the city's landscape for more than 100 years and have been a public forum for political organizers, labor unions, artists and counterculture movements. Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, said that the decrease in crime had apparently left the police with too much free time.</p>
        <p>''The only cultural contribution that Staten Island has ever made to us has been the Wu-Tang Clan,'' a hip-hop group that gained popularity mostly through street advertising, he said. ''We should be careful that we aren't killing the cultural current by successfully enforcing these laws.''</p>
        <p>Eric Foner, a professor of history at Columbia University, pointed out that the city was selling its own real estate to advertisers at an alarming pace, including space on subway cars, Metrocards, stadiums and municipal buses. He said the city seemed ''perfectly happy to let you put your sign anywhere you please, as long as you are willing to pay for it.''</p>
