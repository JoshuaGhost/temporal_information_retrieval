        <p>A Manhattan man who pleaded guilty to kidnapping and sexually abusing an immigrant woman during an 11-day attack was sentenced yesterday to 19 years to life in state prison.</p>
        <p>In passing sentence, Justice Budd Goodman of State Supreme Court told the man, Richard Blau, that the case was ''one of the most heinous crimes that I have ever experienced in my years on the bench.</p>
        <p>''I hope you will never see the light of day,'' Justice Goodman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blau, 45, sat in a wheelchair throughout the sentencing. He suffers from a heart condition and other ailments.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors had charged that Mr. Blau chained the 31-year-old woman in a closet of his Washington Heights apartment and repeatedly tortured and sexually abused her. He pleaded guilty to 12 counts, including sodomy, sexual abuse, attempted rape, assault and kidnapping.</p>
        <p>Kathryn Jones, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case, said: ''The defendant will receive a substantial state prison sentence in exchange for his plea. The victim will be spared describing once again the hell she suffered at the hands of the defendant.''</p>
