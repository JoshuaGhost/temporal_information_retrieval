        <p>LAST year, on a tour of one of the more spectacular gardens in northwestern Connecticut, I was struck by the beauty of giant rhubarb plants, which had been cultivated not for eating but for decoration. Indeed, until the 17th century, rhubarb was considered an ornamental plant, with roots that were used as a medicine. The wide, frilly leaves are, in fact, toxic (they contain oxalic acid), and the idea of eating the stalks did not catch on until the 19th century. Even then, it was chiefly in northern Europe that the stalks captured the imagination of cooks, who made them into jams and jellies, desserts or a sauce to go with meat and even fish.</p>
        <p>The reddish-green stalks, which are in peak season in the spring, have much more flavor than the pink hothouse variety, which is available at other times of the year. If the stalks are very thick, they are better peeled with a vegetable parer. Otherwise, they simply need to be cut in pieces and cooked with quite a lot of sugar (or honey) to be palatable.</p>

        <p>The reddish-green stalks, which are in peak season in the spring, have much more flavor than the pink hothouse variety, which is available at other times of the year. If the stalks are very thick, they are better peeled with a vegetable parer. Otherwise, they simply need to be cut in pieces and cooked with quite a lot of sugar (or honey) to be palatable.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb produces a great deal of juice so it can be used only in pies with top crusts or with a crumbled pastry or lattice-work topping. It is also good in mousses, fools and compotes. A chilled, sweet dessert wine goes well with the following desserts.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb And Mango Compote  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>Unsalted butter to coat baking dish, plus 1 tablespoonful, cut into pieces</p>
        <p>1pound rhubarb, cut into  3/4-inch pieces</p>
        <p>1large ripe mango, cut into cubes</p>
        <p>1/2cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/4teaspoon grated lemon peel</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon ground ginger</p>
        <p>Creme fraiche or whipped cream.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a shallow baking dish and add the rhubarb and mango. Sprinkle the pieces with the sugar, lemon peel and ginger and toss well to combine.</p>
        <p>2. Dot the fruit with the butter and bake about 30 minutes, or until the rhubarb is soft but still holds its shape. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the creme fraiche or whipped cream passed separately.</p>
        <p>Note: Sugar cookies or macaroons go well with this dessert.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb Crumble  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1cup flour</p>
        <p>6tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</p>
        <p>1pound rhubarb, cut into  3/4-inch pieces</p>
        <p>10cardamom pods.</p>
        <p>Creme fraiche or whipped cream.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a food processor, combine the flour and butter with a tablespoon of sugar. Process until the mixture is like bread crumbs and is just beginning to clump. Put it in a bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Butter a large baking dish and add the rhubarb. Sprinkle it with the remaining sugar, reserving a tablespoonful. Peel the cardamom pods and sprinkle the seeds over the rhubarb. Spread the crumble topping evenly over the rhubarb and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar.</p>
        <p>3. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden and the juices are bubbling. Serve warm or at room temperature, with creme fraiche or whipped cream passed separately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb and Ginger Fool  Total time: 20 minutes, plus 2 hours for chilling</p>
        <p>1pound rhubarb, cut into  3/4-inch pieces</p>
        <p>1/2cup sugar</p>
        <p>2tablespoons ginger syrup (or  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger)</p>
        <p>Grated rind and juice of 1 orange</p>
        <p>1cup plain yogurt</p>
        <p>1cup heavy cream, whipped</p>
        <p>1to 2 tablespoons thinly sliced preserved ginger.</p>
        <p>1. Put the rhubarb, sugar, ginger syrup, orange rind and juice in a heavy saucepan. Cook, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb has become soft but still holds its shape (about 7 to 10 minutes).</p>
        <p>2. If the mixture is very liquid, put it in a sieve and drain some of the juice into a small saucepan. Bring the juice to a boil and reduce it by half. Return it to the rhubarb and mix it in.</p>
        <p>3. Chill the rhubarb. When it is cold, stir in the yogurt and the whipped cream. Pour the mixture into six individual glasses or a glass serving bowl. Top with the slices of preserved ginger.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This is good with sugar cookies or macaroons.</p>
