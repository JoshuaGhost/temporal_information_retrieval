        <p>DIANA BUCHANAN, who plans to marry in August, spent much of last week in and out of linen shops on the Upper East Side that sell what might be called the Rolls-Royces of sheets.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday afternoon, she agonized for 40 minutes over the purchase of a $95 boudoir pillow, an item the size of a baby's-crib pillow, at D. Porthault, where a set of queen-size sheets and two shams starts at $1,000 for solid colors and $1,800 for prints.</p>
        <p>For help in understanding the protocol of ultra-luxury bedding, Ms. Buchanan had enlisted her mother, who had come in from Connecticut to point out the hearts-on-white at D. Porthault, the signature chain pattern at Pratesi, the monograms at Leron and the white Jacquard at Frette.</p>
        <p>Caressing a crisp cotton pillowcase, Ms. Buchanan, 27, said that the tiny pillow was all that she could afford at this point but that someday she hoped to have a whole sheet set. ''I understand the importance of having the right sheets,'' she said. ''It's a very subtle way of saying you have excellent taste without, say, driving a Porsche.''</p>
        <p>The famous linen shops in the area of Madison Avenue and the high 60's, which have supplied generations of town-house and country-home bedding for the old guard, are being discovered by a new set: people in their 20's and early 30's who want the status of high-end sheets even if they don't yet have the life style to match.</p>
        <p>Store owners and managers say that an increasing number of their younger customers are dropping $1,000 to $5,000 on linens for starter-type studio or one-bedrooom apartments. In an economy that keeps minting 29-year-old overnight successes -- and has spawned a culture to match that values traditional totems of the luxe life -- 350-thread-count, Egyptian-cotton sheets are now having their day in the sun.</p>
        <p>''It's easier to spend money on sheets than on new furniture,'' said Stephanie Hamada, 35, who is a publicity director for the accessories company Diego Della Valle and who has Frette sheets on the bed in her one-bedroom Upper East Side apartment. ''We're all going toward high-end luxury-quality goods. It's like the Hermes of linen. There's this whole thing about linens and candles.''</p>
        <p>In the back of the Frette store, clerks make up a queen-size bed to show novice buyers what a duvet cover is and how many pillows are needed (don't even mention blanket covers).</p>
        <p>But many are still unprepared for the shock of learning, after purchase, that luxury sheets need ironing and a delicate washing, for which the heavy-duty machines in their building basements are unsuited, unless, of course, sheet fanatics whisk their linens from the dryer when they are still damp. For those who don't want to bother, Frette salesclerks hand customers the card of Rosa Duran, who will hand-wash a sheet set for $32. It's a bargain, considering that Jeeves of Belgravia charges $25 a sheet and $10 a sham.</p>
        <p>Elycia Rubin, 27, a talent executive at E! Entertainment Television in Los Angeles, says the sheets, which are all made by European companies, are also popular on the West Coast. ''All of the Hollywood celebrities and yuppie types are obsessed about making a really classy bed,'' she said. ''It's not about flannel sheets anymore. It's about showing class. God forbid anyone has sheets on their bed that have less than a 200-thread count.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rubin, who found her own Frette sheets at an outlet in Milan, Italy, added, ''Cars, clothes, jewelry, sheets -- it's all in the same line.''</p>
        <p>NOR is it only women who have developed an allegiance to old-line European linen houses that, like Frette, have separate divisions devoted to bedding for private planes and yachts.</p>
        <p>Store managers said that more and more men, many of them single, are asking for three or four sets of ''whatever is classic,'' in the words of Laura Sullivan, an assistant manager of Frette. ''They are the Wall Street and music-industry types,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Scot Lerner, an owner of Halpern Construction, a building company in Manhattan, said, ''I train all my girlfriends and my housekeepers how to wash those sheets.''</p>
        <p>Chatting by cellular phone from his Land Rover, Mr. Lerner, 33, said that in selecting sheets, ''you have to look for a high thread count.'' He continued: ''I'm not buying a sheet and leaving the tag out. I do a lot of things in my bed, and if I don't have good sheets, my skin wears out.''</p>
        <p>He passed the phone to a friend, Randall Kane, 32, another connoisseur of fine bedding, who said: ''Well, I like Pratesi, but I have more of Ralph Lauren. You know, the woven ones. They're good, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lerner disagreed. ''Oh, no, they pill,'' he said. ''But I hear Ralph is coming out with a better line.''</p>
