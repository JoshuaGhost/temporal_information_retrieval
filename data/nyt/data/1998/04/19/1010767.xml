        <p>THAT Andrew Johnson fulfilled his term as 17th President of the United States was to the credit of his Attorney-General, William Maxwell Evarts, who defended him against impeachment with a Senatorial address that lasted 12 hours. As filibusters go, this hardly compares with the current Presidential trial by media, but it seems to have inspired Jared B. Flagg's portrait of Evarts, painted in the 1880's and now in New York State's Court of Appeals in Albany. With one hand tucked in his coat, the subject, who looks remarkably like George C. Scott, stands alone in architectural space evidently in the act of addressing his invisible and doubtless comatose audience.</p>
        <p>The detail reproduced at the top of his column comes from a small study, which though photographed during the cleaning process hangs as good as new at the Hudson River Gallery and Conservators here. It is one of about 80 works produced between 1847 and 1947 by artists who were members of the National Academy or else exhibited there. Most of the images come from private collections, and all have undergone rejuvenation at the gallery, whose proprietors, Helmut and Barbara Zitzwitz, have been at work for 20 years.</p>

        <p>THAT Andrew Johnson fulfilled his term as 17th President of the United States was to the credit of his Attorney-General, William Maxwell Evarts, who defended him against impeachment with a Senatorial address that lasted 12 hours. As filibusters go, this hardly compares with the current Presidential trial by media, but it seems to have inspired Jared B. Flagg's portrait of Evarts, painted in the 1880's and now in New York State's Court of Appeals in Albany. With one hand tucked in his coat, the subject, who looks remarkably like George C. Scott, stands alone in architectural space evidently in the act of addressing his invisible and doubtless comatose audience.</p>
        <p>The detail reproduced at the top of his column comes from a small study, which though photographed during the cleaning process hangs as good as new at the Hudson River Gallery and Conservators here. It is one of about 80 works produced between 1847 and 1947 by artists who were members of the National Academy or else exhibited there. Most of the images come from private collections, and all have undergone rejuvenation at the gallery, whose proprietors, Helmut and Barbara Zitzwitz, have been at work for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Having begun in Greenwich, the couple moved to Riverdale and now have the ideal premises in a large cream-colored building, which has a facade with perpendicular Gothic details, a duck pond alongside and, from the large windows in back, a matchless view of the Hudson River. Inside there is a space as big as a tennis court, where art is rehabilitated and framed, and the gallery, also generous in size.</p>
        <p>Flagg's portrait of Evarts reigns supreme but not without competition, notably from the rear view of a seated man pointing skyward, an 1876 pencil drawing by David Johnson (1827 to 1908). There were many such drawings in the Hudson River Museum exhibition, which celebrated the artist's revival in the early 1980's, but as a study of a figure gesturing from a bench without so much as a tree in the vicinity -- much less a horizon line -- this was easily the most memorable of them.</p>
        <p>Johnson was named national academician in 1861, the same year as Worthington Whittredge, who is represented by a scene of a river, which, though undistinguished, is interesting when considered in the light of a discovery made by Johnson during a mid-century trip to the Italian Alps. As stated in his autobiography, the sight of these mountains extending laterally as well as vertically prompted the artist to reject the dogma that ''all grandeur must be measured up and down'' and, not incidentally, to produce some of the loveliest landscapes in the Hudson River School.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the late-19th-century revival of interest in etching, the exhibition includes prints by artists from Joseph Pemmell, who became president of the National Academy in 1909 and later introduced a course of graphic arts lectures, to Isabel Bishop. Not the least striking of these images, however, is ''My Studio Window,'' a nocturnal view of a woman silhouetted against a dimly lighted building. This was done by Robertson K. Mygatt, who lived from 1862 to 1919 and had his first posthumous exhibition at this gallery in 1991, when it was situated in (and named for) Riverdale.</p>
        <p>In the department of sculpture are two small bronzes by Edwin Deming -- one of a bear suckling her young, the other of a bear improbably sneaking up on the food that lies beside the nude figure of a young woman -- and ''Counsel of War,'' an 1868 composition in painted plaster by John Rogers. The next best thing to a photograph, the group consists of Lincoln, Grant and the then Secretary of War, Stanton, and in those days would have retailed for less than $15.</p>
        <p>Paper made from wood pulp appeared at the turn of the last century and, like most technological innovations, has turned out to be a mixed blessing -- for collectors of works on paper if not for those who restore them. As to the success of the gallery's efforts in this respect, I can only say that, regardless of their age and medium, the drawings and prints are fresh but not aggressively so, and the oils mercifully lack the varnished garishness that was prevalent a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Familiar artists represented by drawings or prints include Thomas Hart Benton, William Gropper, George Grosz (in his American period), John Sloan and Raphael Soyer. But as usually happens in salons-without-a-cause, some of the most striking images come from the lesser-knowns, beginning with the aforementioned portrait by Flagg and ending with a watercolor of spider monkeys cavorting in a tree by Jane Peterson and an expressionistic crayon drawing of a woman's head by Marion Greenwood (both of mid-20th-century vintage).</p>
        <p>It remains only to say that the show, which continues through April, as well as the premises, the conservator and his art historian wife, are all worth a visit.</p>
        <p>The information number is 693-1991.</p>
