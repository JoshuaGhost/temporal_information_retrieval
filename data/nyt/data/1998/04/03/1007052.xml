        <p>Shares of Cor Therapeutics Inc. jumped 79 percent yesterday after the company said it had received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration saying its heart drug Integrilin could be approved. The agency said Integrilin could be approved for the treatment of unstable angina, the acute chest pains that can precede heart attacks, and for patients receiving balloon angioplasty to open clogged arteries, if Cor resolved some details regarding labeling. In January, an advisory panel to the F.D.A. recommended that an additional clinical trial be performed to gain approval, or that the drug might be approvable only for angioplasty. Cor shares gained $9.84375, to $22.3125. Cor, a biotechnology company based in South San Francisco, will share manufacturing and marketing of the drug with the Schering Plough Corporation.</p>
