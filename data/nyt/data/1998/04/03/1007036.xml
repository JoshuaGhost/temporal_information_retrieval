        <p>PAMELA THOMAS-GRAHAM said she had never done any creative writing, except for a a stint with a campus arts paper in college. A 1985 graduate of Harvard, she majored in economics. ''Statistics are the most creative things there are,'' she said yesterday from her office at McKinsey &amp; Company, the consulting firm, where she was the first black woman to become a partner.</p>
        <p>But three years ago, Ms. Thomas-Graham decided she needed more exercise than climbing the corporate ladder. The result is ''A Darker Shade of Crimson,'' a murder mystery set at Harvard that Simon &amp; Schuster is publishing as part of a series of Ivy League mysteries. Ms. Thomas-Graham's second  will be ''Blue Blood,'' at Yale.</p>

        <p>PAMELA THOMAS-GRAHAM said she had never done any creative writing, except for a a stint with a campus arts paper in college. A 1985 graduate of Harvard, she majored in economics. ''Statistics are the most creative things there are,'' she said yesterday from her office at McKinsey &amp; Company, the consulting firm, where she was the first black woman to become a partner.</p>
        <p>But three years ago, Ms. Thomas-Graham decided she needed more exercise than climbing the corporate ladder. The result is ''A Darker Shade of Crimson,'' a murder mystery set at Harvard that Simon &amp; Schuster is publishing as part of a series of Ivy League mysteries. Ms. Thomas-Graham's second  will be ''Blue Blood,'' at Yale.</p>
        <p>The protagonist is Nikki Chase, a 30-year-old economics professor who might remind readers of the author.</p>
        <p>''We're both ambitious young black women,'' the 33-year-old author said. ''But she's single, and I'm happily married and expecting a baby in July.''</p>
        <p>Is the worldly success of the author, or her heroine, the point of writing?</p>
        <p>''The mystery needs to succeed or fail as entertainment,'' Ms. Thomas-Graham said, on her way to her first book party, at the Harvard Club in Manhattan. ''But I did want to make certain points about being a successful black woman.''</p>
        <p>She does so in the first paragraph: ''Laugh at their jokes. Shout when necessary. Maintain a certain distance. Dress impeccably. Know who's who. Save your money. Look them in the eye. Count to 10. Straighten your hair. Pray for strength. Plot your revenge. Have a best friend. Call home often. Keep it real. Call them out. Work the phone. Remember where you came from. And be very, very good.''  PUBLIC LIVES</p>
