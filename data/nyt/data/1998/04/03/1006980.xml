        <p>Dow Average Near 9,000 As Stocks Surge Again  The Dow Jones industrial average flirted with the 9,000-point level as stocks roared higher on waning fears of inflation. The Dow closed at 8,986.64, up 118.32 points, or 1.33 percent.</p>
        <p>So far this week, the blue-chip index has risen 190.56 points, with more than 186 points of the gain in the last two days. [Page D5.]</p>
        <p>The prices of Treasury securities rose, too, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling from 5.88 percent to 5.84, its lowest level since Feb. 18. Investors apparently expected that today's report on employment during March would contain favorable numbers for the bond market. [D5.]</p>
        <p>More Signs of Economic Health  Orders to American factories fell by nine-tenths of 1 percent in February, though the decline was caused by a big drop in aircraft orders, which fluctuate widely. Excluding transportation equipment, orders actually rose. Adding to the picture of steady growth, jobless claims fell last week. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Concern About Charity Legislation  Big publicly held companies are bridling at proposed Federal legislation that would require them to disclose how much money they give individual charities, warning that such a law would have a chilling effect on corporate philanthropy. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Deutsche Bank Signals Shift  Deutsche Bank, which has spent billions of dollars to build up a global investment banking business but achieved only mixed results, sent its clearest signals yet that it was scaling back its ambitions. The chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, said he had no active interest in buying an American investment bank, following speculation that Deutsche Bank might pursue J. P. Morgan. [D2.]</p>
        <p>Scrambling on Mileage Standard  Because of the popularity of light trucks, auto makers are falling short of Federal fuel-economy standards and scrambling for ways to avoid the embarrassment of paying millions of dollars in fines. [A18.]</p>
        <p>Trust to Sell Hilton Stock  Hilton Hotels said that its chairman, Barron Hilton, was planning to sell the nearly 10 percent of the company held by a charitable trust he controls. The announcement heightened speculation about Hilton's plans, at a time when the company is exploring options ranging from splitting the company in two to making acquisitions or putting the company up for sale. [D5.]</p>
        <p>Departure at Salomon Smith Barney  Robert H. Lessin, a vice chairman of Salomon Smith Barney who is credited with building up many of the services that the firm provides to financial buyers of companies, left to devote his time to venture capital investing and managing his own money. [D5.]</p>
        <p>Challenge to Euro Is Rejected  Germany's highest court rejected a quixotic legal challenge to the creation of a single European currency. [A13.]</p>
        <p>Fox Gets Next 'Star Wars' Trilogy  George Lucas's movie company said that the next three films in its ''Star Wars'' series would be distributed by the News Corporation's 20th Century Fox, which also distributed the first three. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Much of Severance to Be Withheld  Under pressure from Gov. George E. Pataki and the New York State Insurance Department, Oxford Health Plans agreed to withhold much of a $9 million severance package it had planned to pay its former chairman, Stephen F. Wiggins. It has already paid him $3.6 million. [D18.]</p>
