        <p>After 15 weeks as the No. 1 film in the nation, ''Titanic'' was finally toppled at the box office over the weekend by ''Lost in Space,'' a science-fiction movie based on the 1960's television series.</p>
        <p>The new film grossed an estimated $20 million, far ahead of ''Titanic,'' the James Cameron blockbuster, which took in about $11.6 million over the weekend. In third place was ''Mercury Rising,'' a Bruce Willis action film, which grossed an estimated $10.9 million, a disappointment to its studio, Universal.</p>

        <p>After 15 weeks as the No. 1 film in the nation, ''Titanic'' was finally toppled at the box office over the weekend by ''Lost in Space,'' a science-fiction movie based on the 1960's television series.</p>
        <p>The new film grossed an estimated $20 million, far ahead of ''Titanic,'' the James Cameron blockbuster, which took in about $11.6 million over the weekend. In third place was ''Mercury Rising,'' a Bruce Willis action film, which grossed an estimated $10.9 million, a disappointment to its studio, Universal.</p>
        <p>'' 'Titanic' is finally dethroned -- bound to happen one day,'' John Krier, president of the Exhibitor Relations Company, which monitors the box office, said this morning. He said, '' 'Lost in Space,' had a tremendous amount of publicity, a lot of hoopla.''</p>
        <p>The big-screen adaptation of ''Lost in Space,'' which cost about $75 million and is the most expensive film ever made by New Line, a division of Time Warner, is based on the 1965-68 CBS science-fiction series about a 21st-century astrophysicist who takes his family on a trip through the cosmos. The film version received unenthusiastic reviews from critics.</p>
        <p>''Titanic,'' which won 11 Academy Awards, including best picture, has grossed more than $530 million in the United States, a record. The film opened on Dec. 19. The epic, which cost about $200 million and was financed by two studios, 20th Century Fox and Paramount, has taken in an estimated $1.2 billion around the world.</p>
