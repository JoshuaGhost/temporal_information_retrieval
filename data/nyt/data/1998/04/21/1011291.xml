        <p>New ballet choreographers seem to grow best untended, like weeds, to judge by the many carefully tasteful or wrongheaded products of programs designed to encourage such brave souls. ''Ballet Builders 1998,'' presented by New Choreographers on Point on Friday night at Gould Hall, was a welcome exception. Seldom have six dances sped by so fast, spilling out so many imaginative ideas and such good performing. There were dull spots, certainly, but they were surprisingly few.</p>
        <p>The evening began on a high note with Susan Manchak's ''Duo Danza,'' danced by Ms. Manchak and Daryl Fowlkes to music by the Kronos Quartet with Foday Musa Suso. Working within the classical ballet canon, as most of the program's choreographers so hearteningly did, Ms. Manchak created a vivid picture of alert bodies pulled close by the magnetic space between them.</p>

        <p>New ballet choreographers seem to grow best untended, like weeds, to judge by the many carefully tasteful or wrongheaded products of programs designed to encourage such brave souls. ''Ballet Builders 1998,'' presented by New Choreographers on Point on Friday night at Gould Hall, was a welcome exception. Seldom have six dances sped by so fast, spilling out so many imaginative ideas and such good performing. There were dull spots, certainly, but they were surprisingly few.</p>
        <p>The evening began on a high note with Susan Manchak's ''Duo Danza,'' danced by Ms. Manchak and Daryl Fowlkes to music by the Kronos Quartet with Foday Musa Suso. Working within the classical ballet canon, as most of the program's choreographers so hearteningly did, Ms. Manchak created a vivid picture of alert bodies pulled close by the magnetic space between them.</p>
        <p>The man and woman in Cherylyn Lavagnino's ''Duet No. 3,'' performed by Sarah Shira and Michael Cecconi, were a compact unit in an interestingly odd dance that was undone by the sleepy score by Scott Killian to which it was set. Kathryn Posin's choice of score for her new ''John Adams Violin Concerto'' seemed unfortunate, too, at first, a darkish, measured score for an outpouring of exuberance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams's music began to build with the dance, however, toward the end. And Ms. Posin, best known as a modern-dance choreographer, takes a fresh new look in this plotless group work at some of the conventions of ballet choreography in spatial plotting and dynamic changes that are full of invention. The ways she introduces and shifts her corps dancers and soloists are particularly inventive. And the 10 fine performers hurtle effortlessly through flowing dance studded with skewed high lifts and catches, with Kiyoko Gotanda standing out for her ground-skimming lightness and resiliency.</p>
        <p>Marijeanne Liederbach brought new life to the familiar subject of a battered and battering relationship in ''Two to Tango,'' set to music by Richard D. James, through heightened psychological nuance, some unexpected narrative and quietly searing performances by Ricardo Gomez and Leslie Anne Cardona, a lyrical dancer who has become a seasoned actor as well.</p>
        <p>We have seen dreaming nocturnal romance on the ballet stage before, too, but not Raymond Van Mason's ''Moonlight,'' danced to Beethoven's ''Moonlight'' Sonata. Mr. Van Mason and Erin Leedom spun delicately through charged turns and lifts, simple yet unacademic, filling the stage with the mystery of a fugitive yet potent fragrance.</p>
        <p>Stephen Mills began with a curious premise in ''Salve Regina,'' set to music by Pergolesi, but never allowed the premise to become an intrinsic part of the choreography. Instead, Mr. Mills, Chris Hannon, Margot Brown and Gina Patterson shifted obediently through mix-and-match sexual pairings in dance that never quite managed to suggest why the choreographer took those pairings as a theme.</p>
        <p>DANCE REVIEW  Correction:  April 25, 1998, Saturday  A picture caption on Tuesday with a review of ''Ballet Builders 1998'' at Gould Hall last Friday misidentified the dancers shown in one piece, ''John Adams Violin Concerto.'' They were Jennifer Balcerzak and Gregory Stuart, not Teanna Zarro and Jeffrey Dorman.</p>
