        <p>David A Damari letter warns that piling on too much homework in early grades and eliminating recess produces burned-out high schoolers with little interest in academics; blames politicians who know more about getting elected than about child development (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is interesting that the push for no recess is being highlighted in Atlanta (front page, April 7), a city you mentioned two years ago in an article about increasing amounts of homework for grade-schoolers. The result of this corporate mentality of productiveness for children is easy to predict: burned-out high schoolers who have little interest in academics. This burnout is already apparent in the suburban school districts here, where the elementary school children get an unimaginable quantity of homework but still have recess.</p>
        <p>This is what can happen when politicians who know more about getting elected than about child development are put in charge of our school districts.</p>
