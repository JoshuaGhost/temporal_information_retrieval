        <p>The old American financial system -- with banks unable to cross state lines and barred by law from getting into some other financial businesses -- was a messy and inefficient one. But it encouraged a diversity that may have helped the economy.</p>
        <p>The new system, cemented by mergers and takeovers that are coming in a wave, is hailed by Wall Street for its efficiency as economies of scale reduce costs. But the presence of fewer substantial competitors also means that the remaining ones are more likely to make the same mistakes if the financial environment again turns hostile.</p>
        <p>Some of today's big players got to be big precisely because they avoided the mistakes of their larger competitors. But there will be fewer midsize players in the future with the ability to move up to the front ranks.</p>
        <p>To see just how much the financial landscape has changed in a generation, consider the lineup of large banks a quarter of a century ago, at the end of 1972. Then there were 10 commercial banks in the United States with assets of more than $10 billion.</p>
        <p>Today, with all the mergers that have transpired in recent years -- and the ones announced in the last two weeks -- just three of those banks are to be owned by the same companies that controlled them a quarter of a century ago.</p>
        <p>The amazing change in banking leadership in this country is a result of several factors. Some banks faltered in the 1970's and 80's because of bad loans. Others were able to grow because of more friendly regulatory treatment in their states as interstate banking became possible. Others merged as banks faced intense competition from other financial services providers.</p>
        <p>As this year began, five of the top 10 of a quarter century ago were still owned by the same owner, or by a successor whose name reflected a reorganization, not a takeover.</p>
        <p>But Citicorp, the company that owns Citibank -- then called First National City Bank of New York -- agreed last week to be acquired by Travelers, the insurance and brokerage giant. And yesterday, BankAmerica agreed to be merged into Nationsbank, the successor to a North Carolina bank that ranked 33d in size a quarter of a century ago.</p>
        <p>The three remaining are all New York banks -- Morgan Guaranty, Chemical Bank and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation. Chemical Bank is no longer around, but its parent corporation, the Chemical New York Corporation, is, having been renamed the Chase Manhattan Corporation when it acquired that bank a few years after absorbing another of the top 10, Manufacturers Hanover. J. P. Morgan still owns Morgan Guaranty, but has indicated it would consider a merger if it is unable to become an investment banking powerhouse on its own. Bankers Trust has expanded into investment banking and has shown no signs of wanting to be bought, though there has been speculation that it might become a target.</p>
        <p>Outside New York, there were four banks in the top 10, as compiled by American Banker based on data from the end of 1972. All but BankAmerica had already gone the takeover route before the latest wave. Security Pacific, based in Los Angeles, was taken over by BankAmerica. Chicago's Continental Illinois, a victim of bad lending in the 1970's, had to be rescued by the Government and was eventually acquired by BankAmerica. First Chicago was taken over by a Detroit bank in 1995, only to have the merged entity agree to be bought yesterday by Banc One of Columbus, Ohio. A quarter of a century ago, that company's predecessor, First Bank Group of Ohio, was the third-largest banking company in Columbus. It was nowhere near the top 100 in the nation.</p>
        <p>The fate of the Chicago banks reflects the fear in which they were held back home. For decades, Illinois law barred them from expanding to other parts of Illinois. That was supposed to protect downstate banks. In the end, it merely left them open to acquisition by banks from outside the state and assured that the headquarters of big Chicago banks would no longer be in Illinois.</p>
        <p>During this great period of consolidation, Wall Street has fallen in and out of love with the banks several times. There have been worries over bad loans, over the costs of all that branch-bank real estate in an increasingly computerized age, and of deteriorating market share for banks as mutual funds have come on strong.</p>
        <p>But lately, there has been an intense love affair. In the 1990's, interest rates have come down -- and the biggest reductions have come in what banks pay for deposits, not what they charge for loans. With the economy healthy, relatively few bad loans have appeared, and Wall Street has come to expect good profit increases for the banks that survive, with each merger meaning the elimination of redundant costs and opportunities to sell more products to more customers.</p>
        <p>Of the four banks in yesterday's deals, the stock in three rose. Banc One shares rose in early trading but settled back to end unchanged at $61.75.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem there was that in a meeting with analysts yesterday, John B. McCoy, chairman of Banc One, said his goal for annual profit increases now was 13 to 15 percent. He tried to hint that he really didn't mean to imply the figure could be as low as 13 percent, but some analysts immediately noted that the old figure had been 15 percent, and the stock soon weakened.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, when bad loans were bringing banks down and analysts were vying to predict failures correctly, the idea of banks as growth vehicles would have seemed quaint. If and when the credit excesses of this era appear in earning reports, it may again seem odd.</p>
        <p>The old system that kept banks within state lines, and out of other financial businesses, may have been inefficient. But it meant that when the biggest players stumbled, there were others who could grow to take up the slack. And the huge number of banks meant that banks were likely to pursue differing strategies, some wiser, or luckier, than others. Contrast that with European countries, which tended to be dominated by a few large banks that were likely to make similar mistakes.</p>
        <p>The consolidation phase of American banking is continuing, and there is no sign of an early end. The resulting behemoths may be better at squeezing out costs and at marketing the most products. But they are less likely to be nimble in the way that smaller institutions could be, and that fact -- in the next economic cycle or the one after that -- may prove to be very important, and the source of disappointment to investors.
