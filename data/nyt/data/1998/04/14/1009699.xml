        <p>The First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said yesterday that it had consolidated its direct marketing account at two shops: Hill, Holliday Direct in Boston, which will serve as the lead direct marketing agency, and Earle Palmer Brown Direct in Philadelphia, which will handle projects and special assignments. The account, with billings estimated at $30 million, had been divided among several agencies.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a four-month review that had been narrowed to Hill, Holliday Direct -- part of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- and Earle Palmer Brown Direct. Pile &amp; Company in Boston, a consulting company, conducted the review. Hal Riney &amp; Partners in San Francisco continues handling general advertising for First Union.</p>
