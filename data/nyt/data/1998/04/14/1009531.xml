        <p>COOK-Rabbi Samuel, 91. Died in Cincinnati, on April 12. His great distinctiveness was directing NFTY-National (now N. Amer.) Federation of Temple Youth. Developed by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations to maintain Jewish affiliation of young Jews, NFTY itself became the driving force giving direction to the entity creating it, spawning the majority of rabbis, cantors, educators, and lay-leaders of Reform Judaism who were motivated to become such by experiences at summer camps and regional conclaves. He is survived by his wife, Ray Cook, and two sons, Michael and Joel Cook, and eight grandchildren. Memorial contributions may be made to NFTY.</p>
