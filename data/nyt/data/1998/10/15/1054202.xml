        <p>Heads turned at an otherwise routine public hearing in City Hall yesterday when an unexpected visitor walked through the doors: Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the minister who has not been seen much in the city since he led a rally in Harlem last month that ended in brief violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad, who is better known for his anti-Semitic orations than for any interest in the mundanities of local governance, did not address the City Council's subcommittee on permits and dispositions, which is considering the fate of Mart 125, a kind of indoor flea market that operates in a city-owned building on West 125th Street between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards.</p>
        <p>But when pressed for comment by reporters as he left, Mr. Muhammad once again took aim at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, calling him at one point ''an ordinary cracker.''</p>
        <p>The two men traded barbs in the weeks leading up to the so-called Million Youth March, a Labor Day weekend rally that culminated with scuffles between the police and some spectators.</p>
        <p>Asserting that Mr. Muhammad's language had essentially incited the violence, Mr. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir called for his arrest. They later pulled back from that call when the Manhattan District Attorney's office announced that it was conducting a grand jury investigation.</p>
        <p>''There is a grand jury meeting on the Million Youth March activities and it has not come up with its findings as of this point,'' Mr. Safir said yesterday, when informed that Mr. Muhammad had shown up at City Hall. ''So as of this time there is no warrant for Mr. Muhammad.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad, who had been ubiquitous in the days leading up to the Sept. 5 rally, was largely absent in its aftermath; for example, he did not attend a news conference held the next day by the rally's organizers. Yesterday's appearance may have been among his first in the city since the rally; he said he was at the hearing to show support for black entrepreneurs who work at the mart.</p>
        <p>At issue is how the city will use the building in the future. Since it opened in 1986, the mart has been a place for vendors to rent space, with the hope of someday owning and operating it themselves. But the small-business project fell apart; the building had structural problems, and many vendors stopped paying rent. The city took over the building in 1996, and since then has been trying to figure out how best to use the space.</p>
        <p>After the hearing, Mr. Muhammad blamed Mr. Giuliani for representing ''the sentiments of a growing number of closet crackers,'' and for creating an atmosphere in which a group of white men rode on a float at a Labor Day parade in Queens that ridiculed black people. He did not mention that the Mayor strongly condemned the float and demanded the ouster of two firefighters and a police officer who wore blackface on the float.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has been criticized in the past for engaging Mr. Muhammad in angry debate through the news media. Yesterday, however, his press secretary, Colleen Roche, said that the Mayor would have no comment on Mr. Muhammad's visit to City Hall.</p>
