        <p>With the notable exception of being able to count a professional tennis title among her laurels, Anna Kournikova, the latest player to qualify for the year-ending Chase Championships next month at Madison Square Garden, seems to have everything going her way: in just three years she has soared from 281st to 12th in the rankings, reached the 1997 Wimbledon semifinals, and she has managed not to lose a match to anybody ranked beneath the Top 15 since January 1997.</p>
        <p>She has also become a celebrity magnet.  Her appearance in New York next month will mark the first for Kournikova at the championships, an invitation-only event for the year's top 16 singles performers and top eight doubles teams.</p>

        <p>The Russian-born teen-ager, a Florida resident since she moved to the United States to train full time at 9, said she has earned her public profile by playing good tennis, not by being a publicity-seeker. If I was ranked 1,000th, nobody would even notice me, she said yesterday from the European Championships in Zurich, where a first-round loss to Belgium's Dominique van Roost left her with just one event, Moscow, to break her title-less streak before the Nov. 16-22 championships.</p>
