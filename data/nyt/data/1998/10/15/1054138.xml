        <p>Congress votes to extend current copyright term by 20 years, offering reprieve to creators and corporations holding rights to popular cultural icons (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Congress has voted to extend the current copyright term by 20 years. The move offers a reprieve to creators and corporations holding the rights to such cultural icons as Mickey Mouse and the songs of George and Ira Gershwin, products of the 1920's that under the current law would begin entering the public domain in the year 2,000.</p>
        <p>The current law gives protection to works of art for the lifetime of the artist plus 50 years. For works copyrighted before 1978, or by corporations, like many Disney cartoons, the protection lasts for 75 years from the date of the original copyright.</p>

        <p>The new bill, which would add 20 years to those expiration dates, is expected to be signed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Some academics and legal experts have opposed an extension, saying that copyright renewals are a violation of the Constitution, which provides for copyright protection for ''limited times.'' Proponents have argued that it is necessary to protect artists' estates and the balance of trade. Intellectual properties like cartoon figures and old songs are among the nation's major exports.</p>
