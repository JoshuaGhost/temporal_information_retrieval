        <p>The league's 1998 champion will be determined tomorrow at the Rose Bowl, with D.C. United facing the Chicago Fire.</p>
        <p>The league announced yesterday that next year's championship would be played at Foxboro Stadium near Boston. Foxboro Stadium was the host of the league's first title game in 1996, when a crowd of 34,643 braved a downpour and fierce winds to watch D.C. United's 3-2 overtime triumph over the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>
        <p>The league also announced that Philip F. Anschutz had bought the Los Angeles Galaxy for $26 million. Anschutz, a Denver-based billionaire, also owns the league's Chicago Fire and Colorado Rapids.</p>
