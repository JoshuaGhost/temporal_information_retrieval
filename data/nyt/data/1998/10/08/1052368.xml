        <p>Back to the Store</p>
        <p>MARVIN S. TRAUB, the ringmaster of the circus known as Bloomingdale's for 13 years before, during and after the department-store takeover wars, is trying again. He has been named chairman of a new chain that will sell furniture and bedding in outlet malls.</p>
        <p>He did not need a Rolodex of contacts to make the arrangements. He is a director of Prime Retail, the largest owner of outlet malls. And Financo, the investment banking firm where he has worked since 1993, arranged the financing for the new company, Home Company-Fine Furniture Direct.</p>

        <p>Back to the Store</p>
        <p>MARVIN S. TRAUB, the ringmaster of the circus known as Bloomingdale's for 13 years before, during and after the department-store takeover wars, is trying again. He has been named chairman of a new chain that will sell furniture and bedding in outlet malls.</p>
        <p>He did not need a Rolodex of contacts to make the arrangements. He is a director of Prime Retail, the largest owner of outlet malls. And Financo, the investment banking firm where he has worked since 1993, arranged the financing for the new company, Home Company-Fine Furniture Direct.</p>
        <p>The first store is scheduled to open in May in San Marcos, Tex., a long way from Italy and France, where Mr. Traub, 73, spent last week attending to another of his ventures, a consulting business. ''I've been having a very good time'' since leaving Bloomingdale's in 1991, he said. ''I think that if you stop, you get much older.''</p>
        <p>A New Model</p>
        <p>Some cosmetics makers are advancing the idea that models come in all shapes, sizes and ages. Last month, EVONNE SWANN, 61, who claims to be the oldest woman to sign a beauty contract, began appearing in ads for Oil of Olay moisturizer.</p>
        <p>Now, Revlon has signed EMME, a plus-size model, which means size 12 and above. ''This gig is a big deal,'' she said. ''For so many years, so many women put themselves through hell thinking if they don't look like a 16-year-old, they're not beautiful. I kind of finish that off, the idea that we're all included in beauty.''</p>
        <p>A Date in Court</p>
        <p>A first date ''turn-on'' would be ''a nice kiss good night,'' RYAN MARTIN, a 22-year-old club manager, told Cosmopolitan magazine when he was selected for a special issue on America's ''most wanted'' single men.</p>
        <p>That was in June. Last month, Mr. Ryan was arrested on charges of drugging and raping a 23-year-old woman in Worcester, Mass. He pleaded not guilty and was released on $20,000 bond.</p>
        <p>Detective Lieut. William P. O'Connor of the Worcester police said that Mr. Martin met two women in a bar and took them to a restaurant he managed after it had closed. He said that Mr. Martin served them alcoholic drinks, followed by a cupful of a liquid Mr. Martin said had come from a nutrition store.</p>
        <p>The woman Mr. Ryan is accused of raping ''felt very tired, was unable to drive her car home and that's when they were offered a stay at Mr. Martin's house,'' the lieutenant said. ''The next morning the victim woke up and, thinking she may have been sexually assaulted, went to the hospital.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant O'Connor said that hospital personnel examined her for evidence of rape. The woman was found to have gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which Lieutenant O'Connor said was a so-called date rape drug, in her bloodstream.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin's lawyer, ANTHONY M. SALERNO, said that Mr. Martin denied serving such a substance. He added, ''I don't think he's acknowledging that there was even any sex.''</p>
        <p>Say It Again</p>
        <p>So what does MAX WEINBERG, the drummer in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, have to say about the fact that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominated Mr. Springsteen but not the band?</p>
        <p>With a straight face Mr. Weinberg said, ''No one deserves to be included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame more than Bruce.''</p>
        <p>No hard feelings?</p>
        <p>With a straighter face, he said, ''Like I said, no one deserves to be included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame more than Bruce.''</p>
        <p>Would he and the band perform for, or with, Mr. Springsteen at the induction ceremony?</p>
        <p>''Like I said, no one deserves to be included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame more than Bruce.''</p>
        <p>Doesn't this sound like a broken record?</p>
        <p>He laughed, and walked away.</p>
