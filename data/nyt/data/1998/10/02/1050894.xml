        <p>Armed with a steel harpoon, a .50-caliber rifle and permission to conduct the first legal hunt for a gray whale in American waters in more than 50 years, members of a small Indian tribe gathered today on a beach on the rugged Olympic Peninsula of Washington to start an adventure intended to resurrect the glory and traditions of their whale-hunting forefathers.</p>
        <p>But before the eight-man crew could even launch its 32-foot cedar canoe into the steely waters of the Pacific, the Makah Indians had to contend with a modern flotilla of animal-rights protesters, themselves equipped with a submarine painted to resemble a whale and an underground speaker system that the protesters said was capable of scaring off a whale and saving its life.</p>

        <p>Armed with a steel harpoon, a .50-caliber rifle and permission to conduct the first legal hunt for a gray whale in American waters in more than 50 years, members of a small Indian tribe gathered today on a beach on the rugged Olympic Peninsula of Washington to start an adventure intended to resurrect the glory and traditions of their whale-hunting forefathers.</p>
        <p>But before the eight-man crew could even launch its 32-foot cedar canoe into the steely waters of the Pacific, the Makah Indians had to contend with a modern flotilla of animal-rights protesters, themselves equipped with a submarine painted to resemble a whale and an underground speaker system that the protesters said was capable of scaring off a whale and saving its life.</p>
        <p>And the United States Coast Guard, intent on preventing the groups from clashing, kept close watch on a scene that has posed an exquisite quandary for many environmental groups. Finding themselves caught between the save-the-whales ethos represented by the protesters and the respect for centuries-old American Indian traditions that the Makah say their whale hunt is all about, many leading environmental groups have taken no position at all on the matter.</p>
        <p>While they did practice today, there was no indication that the Makahs had ventured into the ocean for any sort of hunt; once they do, of course, it is impossible to say whether they will quickly achieve their goal.</p>
        <p>Though no living Makah has ever hunted a whale, the Indian nation here at the northwestern tip of the contiguous United States was once renowned for its hunting prowess, and, under an 1855 treaty with the American Government, it is the only Indian tribe specifically guaranteed the right to hunt whales.</p>
        <p>Supported by the Clinton Administration and a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department, the tribe last year won a rare exemption from the worldwide whaling ban and, as of today, has the right to take up to five gray whales per year in the next five years. Though critics fear that the Makah hunt will open the door to commercial whaling here and elsewhere, the Indians say they plan to use the whale meat, oil and blubber only for their own food and for ceremonial purposes.</p>
        <p>''The hunt is the missing link, the thing that brings us full circle to our traditions,'' said Marcy Parker, vice chairwoman of the Makah tribal council. ''We're ocean families, whaling families. So much of what we are all about comes from the ocean, and we feel a deep spiritual need to do this.''</p>
        <p>Though the Makahs live in a spectacular forested setting hard by the sea and at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, it is a community racked by unemployment and tainted by drugs and other modern plagues. Many here say the whale hunt has succeeded in instilling a new sense of purpose in the lives of the young men selected for the hunt, and in the Makah Nation at large.</p>
        <p>Some tribal elders who can remember the taste of whale meat are not so sure the hunt is a good idea.</p>
        <p>''I admire the young people for taking on the challenge, but I just hope to God that no one is hurt,'' said 82-year-old Hildred Ides, whose grandfather was a whale hunter. ''Going for a whale is a very serious thing, a very dangerous thing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ides's cousin, Irene Ward Ides, 88, nodded in agreement as they sat watching dancers in the community hall here one recent evening.</p>
        <p>''I wonder if they really know what they are doing,'' Irene Ides said. ''The whale can get awfully mad. The whales know they're being chased.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the gray whale, which can weigh as much as 40 tons and grow much longer than the hunters' canoe, was called the ''devil fish'' by 19th-century whalers for its propensity to thrash and fight when attacked.</p>
        <p>Conversely, when not under attack, the whales can be inordinately friendly and are known to swim and play alongside boats, making them a popular tourist sight all along their annual migration route from Baja California to the Bering Sea.</p>
        <p>''In 1995, all of the crew on board the conservation ship Edward Abbey were privileged to meet a young, friendly whale we named Buddy,'' says an alert posted on the World Wide Web by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a group based in Southern California that has taken the lead in opposing the Makah hunt and prides itself in having scuttled whaling missions around the world.</p>
        <p>''This October,'' the alert adds, ''Buddy may be blasted to death against those cliffs, near the reservation at Neah Bay.''</p>
        <p>The young men of the Makah Nation, who have been training for months and have traveled as far as Russia to learn whaling techniques, describe the hunt in sacred terms  and say it is a powerful way to connect with prior generations of Makah hunters and with the tribe's traditions, which include hundreds of songs and dances oriented around the hunt. They defend their planned use of a powerful rifle to finish off the whale once it is harpooned as a modern protective measure that would be sanctioned by their ancestors.</p>
        <p>''We are praying to be right with God,'' said Eric Johnson, a muscular 31-year-old who is a teacher in the Makah's Head Start program and the captain of the hunt team.</p>
        <p>''God is the one to judge whether or not we get the whale, and whether or not we will survive,'' Mr. Johnson said at dusk the other night, just before he and other crew members slipped away into the coastal fog for a practice session, chanting songs that were intended to coax a whale toward their canoe.</p>
        <p>With the gray whales driven almost to extinction by global whaling, the Makahs stopped whaling sometime in the 1920's, and the United States banned the hunting of gray whales in 1937 in an effort to protect the species. It has been a conservation success story: there are now an estimated 23,000 whales out in the Pacific, the highest number in at least a century, the National Marine Fisheries Service says.</p>
        <p>The whale was officially removed from the endangered species list in 1994, an action that led to the Makah tribe's campaign for whaling rights.</p>
        <p>Even as tribesmen huddled today on the beach and met with Coast Guard officials in an effort to find ways to keep the protesters at bay, the hunt's opponents were vowing to protect the whales.</p>
        <p>''We're not talking about five whales, we're talking about thousands of whales,'' said Paul Watson, the leader of the Sea Shepherd, from his cellular phone aboard one of the group's boats, anchored off Neah Bay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watson said he believed that if the Makahs succeeded in taking even a single whale, it would open the floodgates to demands for whale hunts by other Indian tribes in the United States and Canada and, even more alarmingly in his view, to non-Indian whalers in countries like Iceland, Japan and Norway.</p>
        <p>The protesters, who also gathered for a vigil on Wednesday in nearby Port Angeles, have drawn the wrath of many of the Makahs.</p>
        <p>So have the hundreds of people from across the country who have made threatening telephone calls or written scornful letters to the Makahs, like this one from Vermont: ''So much for the 'We love the earth, peace, harmony, etc.' What garbage. You people ought to stick to welfare. Your culture -- what a joke.''</p>
        <p>Janine Bowechop, the executive director of the Makah Cultural and Research Center here, which has a display about the tribe's whaling history in its museum, said she was frustrated by the way that animal-rights groups, in her depiction, had ''slaughtered and distorted'' the tribe's interest in a whale hunt.</p>
        <p>''They are completely misrepresenting what is a very meaningful tradition, something that is centuries old,'' Ms. Bowechop said. ''The question should be, What's the fuss all about? America is supposed to be about the acceptance of different values.''</p>
        <p>Keith A. Johnson, tribal treasurer and head of the Makah whaling commission, said: ''They come all the way out here to harass the Makah, a little tribe that wants to take a few whales out of the ocean. They have no idea about the richness of our culture, what this is all about.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke in the tribal headquarters here, Mr. Johnson sprayed processed cheese spread on a cracker and popped it in his mouth. Even as he joked about his snack (''We hear you can make this stuff from whale blubber, too,'' he said.), it was a reminder of how modern forces pervade the 27,000-acre reservation.</p>
        <p>Once whale meat constituted almost 80 percent of the Makah diet, and a successful hunt may revive the whale's importance in the community for both spiritual and sustenance purposes. But others think that time is past, and should be.</p>
        <p>''I just don't like the idea of killing whales, that's all,'' said Valerie Brown, a Makah woman who works as a cook at Beebe's, a restaurant in Neah Bay. ''Nobody around here knows what whale meat tastes like, anyway. Nobody ever asks if we have it on the menu.''</p>
