        <p>Back when I came up, baseball was about establishing yourself. You wanted to get in position to break the records of the players you grew up watching. I'm just now getting to the point where guys like Rod Carew, Pete Rose and George Brett were, and it's exciting to me. But now you've got young guys who don't even think about the history of the game or putting their names in the record books. The money they're making, if they get one long deal, they don't have to keep playing. They don't ask a lot of questions like I did either. Man, I was a pest. If Cincinnati was here, I'd be sitting on the bench watching Rose take batting practice, then asking him about hitting. Guys today, they're scared to approach you, scared to say hello. I did have this one guy, though, a catcher for the Marlins, who sent me a note this season. Do you have five minutes to talk? I sent back a note: Sure -- on the last day of the series. You don't want him going on a tear against you. After we talked, he went on a tear. That feels good. You think: maybe you made a difference.</p>

        <p>People ask me why I've stayed loyal to the Padres. I did it mainly because I'm selfish. I went to college here, at San Diego State, and I like it here, even if we haven't won as often as I would've liked. Yeah, maybe I lost money by staying put, but I'm a big security freak. If they made an offer two years before my contract was up, I jumped on it. For me it's about getting what I thought was fair. My last two contracts, I didn't let it go public, so when they were announced it shocked a lot of people. This last one got a little testy but nobody knew. I like it to come across clean and crisp so people don't wind up reading something they don't like.</p>
