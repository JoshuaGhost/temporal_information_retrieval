        <p>Bruce Bochy was a seldom-used catcher, Tim Flannery a utility infielder, Greg Booker a relief pitcher. They were not the stars of the team, but they, along with Tony Gwynn, are the links to the only other time the San Diego Padres played in the World Series.</p>
        <p>Bochy is the manager of the team that opened the World Series against the Yankees last night with a 9-6 loss. Flannery is the third-base coach, Booker the bullpen coach.</p>
        <p>Eric Show and Alan Wiggins also played for the 1984 Padres. They were not at Yankee Stadium last night. Show, that team's leading pitcher with 15 victories, died of a drug overdose in 1994. Wiggins, who set club records that season with 70 stolen bases and 106 runs scored, died of AIDS in 1991, 40 months after he was suspended from baseball for drug use.</p>
        <p>''It really wasn't good for those two fellows, but they did a hell of a job helping us win,'' Dick Williams, the manager of the 1984 Padres, said Friday.</p>
        <p>The 1984 Padres won the National League West championship by 12 games, then edged the Chicago Cubs in a thrilling five-game pennant playoff after losing the first two games. That they lost the World Series to the Detroit Tigers in five games was almost an afterthought.</p>
        <p>''We turned on a city for the first time that had never been there, never been through anything like that; it was unbelievable,'' Rich (Goose) Gossage said, recalling his first year in San Diego, where he learned there was life after the Yankees. ''That season was exciting. The big thing was we were happy to be in the World Series. Big deal if we won. I don't think that intensity was there as a team. We were just happy to be there.''</p>
        <p>The Padres got there by snatching late-inning victories against the Cubs. In the ninth inning of Game 4, Steve Garvey hit a two-run home run, and in the seventh inning of Game 5, Flannery hit a ground ball.</p>
        <p>''Carmelo Martinez was at second with one out,'' Flannery related, ''and I hit a ground ball that went through Leon Durham's legs. Carmelo scored the tying run. Then Wiggins hit a little chip shot to left field and Tony drove us both in with a double to right-center.''</p>
        <p>The 1984 season was Gwynn's first full season in the major leagues and produced the first of his eight batting titles. He played in the outfield with Kevin McReynolds and Martinez, also in their first full seasons. Terry Kennedy was the catcher.</p>
        <p>Garvey, a veteran and a star, was in his second season with the Padres after leaving Los Angeles as a free agent. Wiggins, who had been an outfielder, played second base for the first time. Garry Templeton was the shortstop, and third baseman Graig Nettles was acquired by the Padres in a trade with the Yankees four days before the season opened.</p>
        <p>Show was in the starting rotation with Ed Whitson, who two months after the World Series would join the Yankees as a free agent, a move he would live to regret; Tim Lollar, who had previously played for the Yankees; Dave Dravecky, who in 1991 would lose his pitching arm to cancer; Mark Thurmond and Andy Hawkins. The closer was Gossage, who joined the Padres as a free agent that year.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to go somewhere where I could make a difference,'' Gossage said. ''I felt San Diego was on the verge. Somebody in the bullpen was all they needed. That and a third baseman, and then we got Nettles.''</p>
        <p>The former Yankees Gossage and Nettles, Williams recalled, were instrumental in the Padres' success not only on the field but also in the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''They were the two big guys for us,'' he said, ''helping our young kids, constantly talking to them, sitting around after games having beers with them. If we hadn't had those two, we would've been in a lot of trouble.''</p>
        <p>Flannery echoed Williams's assessment. ''Nettles and Goose brought something that was really needed,'' he said. ''They brought an attitude. They taught me a lot about how to deal with a lot of situations on as well as off the field.''</p>
        <p>Flannery also cited Garvey's contribution off the field. ''Garvey was the guy who did all the interviews,'' he said. ''Everyone else just played ball.''</p>
        <p>Well, not quite. Some players became involved in other matters. That was the year the John Birch Society, the politically conservative organization, came to baseball, and it made its presence known in the Padres' clubhouse. Show was its most active proponent and was joined most notably by two other pitchers, Dravecky and Thurmond.</p>
        <p>''On an off day,'' Williams related, ''they had a booth at the fairgrounds. Show had Dravecky and Thurmond go out with him. They were passing out pamphlets. All hell broke loose.''</p>
        <p>Williams and the former players said the impact of the controversy on the team was exaggerated.</p>
        <p>''It was played out in the media and everywhere else more so than it was in the clubhouse,'' Booker said. ''You were dealing with guys who were very well liked by all their teammates. If you knew the guys involved in it, you knew what they stood for and it wasn't a prejudice thing or anything like that.</p>
        <p>''I personally right now still don't know exactly what it is or what it stands for.''</p>
        <p>Flannery said that Show was genuinely interested in the John Birch idea, but questioned the seriousness of Dravecky and Thurmond.</p>
        <p>''I think I could've signed them up for Amway if I wanted to,'' Flannery said. ''It just so happened they got signed up with Show.''</p>
        <p>He said it created no distraction but rather served as ''a good laugh for all the guys.'' He remembered joking about it. ''I said I showed up with binoculars and a book on birds thinking it was the Audubon Society,'' Flannery said.</p>
        <p>Gossage agreed that the players didn't let the matter bother them that year, but he believed it was one of the factors that brought a quick end to the Padres' success after that season.</p>
        <p>''I think the next year and the year after it kind of got to everybody and had a negative effect on everybody,'' Gossage said. ''I think there was a wedge driven between the guys with religion and the guys who were free spirits like myself. I think we let too much off-the-field stuff bother us. It was a combination of a lot of things, but it was a shame because we were on the verge of dominating that division for a long time. It was wide open, up for grabs, but we went downhill.''</p>
        <p>The slide didn't end until this year.</p>
