        <p>OVERHEAD garage doors have more components than any other door in the house, and periodic maintenance is necessary to keep them functioning smoothly and to eliminate potential problems.</p>
        <p>When an overhead garage door fails to operate properly, the problem can usually be traced to the mounting screws that hold the brackets or tracks; the rollers that guide the door; the hinges or rollers, or the springs.</p>
        <p>There are two types of overhead garage doors: one-piece doors that have a rigid, lightweight panel that swings up as a single unit and sectional garage doors that have several horizontal panels joined together by hinges. These doors fold as they move. Sectional garage doors have more complex mechanisms than one-piece units, but both models require periodic servicing.</p>
        <p>First look at all the hardware: the hinges, rollers and brackets. Make sure all holding screws and bolts are tight. If you try to tighten a loose screw and find that it has stripped its threads, pull it out and replace it with a carriage bolt. Drill a hole through the door and insert the carriage bolt from the outside; secure it with a nut and washer from the inside.</p>
        <p>Inspect the door rollers to make sure they are in good condition; then check to see that the roller spindles are parallel to the door seams and are not bent. Bent or broken rollers should be replaced. (Most home centers stock these parts.) Lubricate the spindles and roller bearings twice a year with lightweight oil; squirt a few drops of oil on the door hinge pins.</p>
        <p>All overhead doors travel in their upward path along metal tracks. One-piece doors have two tracks hanging from the ceiling joists. Section doors also have two overhead tracks, but these curve down into vertical tracks on either side of the door opening. Rollers, mounted in door brackets, travel in the tracks to keep the door on course. Tracks should be level (or slightly pitched toward the back of the garage), plumb, straight and clean. Bent tracks will allow the rollers to pop out, making it difficult to raise or lower the door. Dirt and debris can cause the rollers to bind.</p>
        <p>Use a level to inspect the tracks at least once a year. Make sure horizon members are level and vertical sections are plumb. Hold a long metal ruler against the tracks to check for straightness, and make sure all sections are in line. Measure the distance between the tracks to be sure they are parallel and equidistant. If they are not correctly aligned, use a wrench to loosen the holding brackets; then gently tap the tracks into place. Tighten the brackets. Wipe the inside of the tracks clean, then spray them with silicone lubricant.</p>
        <p>Heavy-duty springs are coupled to the door with braided cable. They assist the operator in lifting and closing the door. All overhead garage doors have either tension springs (sometimes called an extension spring) or torsion springs. Tension springs are mounted in pairs, one on either side of the door; they extend and are under tension when the door is down. Torsion springs are mounted crosswise above the door opening and are always under tension.</p>
        <p>If the springs are adjusted correctly, the tension will keep the door in place when the bottom of the door is within three feet of the ground. If raised above that level, the door should slowly raise by itself. Before trying to readjust the springs, make sure that all the other components are lubricated and functioning properly.</p>
        <p>Tension springs are adjusted by repositioning the S-hook at the end of the braided-lift cable. (One-piece doors have the S-hook and bracket, but not the cable.) This hook, above the opening on either side the door, fits into one of a series of holes in an overhead bracket. Raise the door and use blocks or clamps to hold it in place. Move the hooks away from the springs to increase the tension. Remember to make the same adjustment on both door cables.</p>
        <p>Torsion springs are adjusted by inserting an iron bar into a slot at the end of the spring, then twisting it to tighten an internal ratchet mechanism. While this sounds simple, it can be dangerous because the spring is under heavy tension. It is best to leave tension-spring adjustment to a professional.</p>
