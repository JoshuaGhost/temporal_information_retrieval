        <p>THE HUNDRED DAYS</p>
        <p>By Patrick O'Brian.</p>
        <p>281 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $24.</p>
        <p>It is the early spring of 1815, and two elderly English naval lieutenants are high up on the southern slopes of Gibraltar, observing and commenting on a squadron of Royal Navy vessels under Commodore Jack Aubrey coming steadily closer to the harbor:</p>
        <p>''It was a wonderfully beautiful day, with a slight and varying but reasonably favorable breeze at last: the sun blazed on the various kinds of broom in flower, upon the Rock, upon the cistuses and giant heath, while an uninterrupted stream of migrant birds, honey buzzards, black kites, all the European vultures, storks both black and white, bee eaters, hoopoes and countless hirundines flowed across the sky amidst a general indifference; for all eyes were fixed upon the middle distance, where the squadron had come about on the starboard tack.''</p>
        <p>Thus begins the 19th of what are now popularly referred to as the Aubrey-Maturin novels, about naval warfare, by Patrick O'Brian. They are part of that genre of naval historical fiction that stretches back to Frederick Marryat and C. S. Forester and reaches forward to such contemporaries of O'Brian as Alexander Fullerton and Alexander Kent -- a genre that seems to be booming in recent years, and capturing male and female readers alike.</p>
        <p>That said, a reading of only the first few pages of any book in the Aubrey-Maturin series would tell the readers that they were being presented with something different from, and more than, fictional accounts of naval actions and storms at sea. Battles there are aplenty, and O'Brian matches Forester in the excitement, detail and bloody realism of his reconstructions. But these naval tales are blended into a larger panorama of Georgian society and politics, science, medicine, botany and the whole conspectus of contemporary Enlightenment knowledge about the natural world.</p>
        <p>Consider simply the above quotation, taken from the second paragraph of ''The Hundred Days.'' The overall scene is about British warships coming into Gibraltar; but only O'Brian among the naval writers would think to slip into that long sentence on the migrating birds, and detail specific types. How many other naval authors, one wonders, would actually have known that the Strait of Gibraltar is one of the great crossing points for the northward and southward avian migrations, or even cared? By contrast, O'Brian's works abound with captivating descriptions of fauna and flora all over the globe, of classical concerts (with a Locatelli or Haydn piece being expertly described), of gossip about the changing fate of the Whigs and Tories at Westminster, all forming a rich and varied complement to sections about naval rigging and life below deck.</p>
        <p>O'Brian's brilliant device for making his works into more than naval history is, of course, his invention of dual heroes, the bluff and ultracompetent Aubrey being always accompanied by his eccentric ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin -- a naval surgeon, yes, but also a highly regarded British intelligence agent, a former Irish radical, a multilingual polymath, a natural philosopher with a passion for beetles, sea creatures, birds and animals that often tempts him to linger on strange shores when the impatient Aubrey is urgent for the next battle. This character mix works so well, and all is written so beautifully, that O'Brian's worldwide fans have come to expect a new novel every year. ''The Hundred Days'' is this season's offering, and there is no doubt the fans will like it.</p>
        <p>THE novel is set in the ''hundred days'' between Napoleon's escape from Elba and his final defeat at Waterloo in mid-1815, and our heroes must thwart dastardly efforts by Balkan mercenaries and North African potentates to assist a Bonapartist victory. Naval actions off the Adriatic coast, strenuous secret journeys into the interior North African wastes by Maturin and a decisive battle to seize a gold convoy attempting to run the Strait of Gibraltar are typical high points of this tale, though always interspersed with those special O'Brian features. As the creators of other paired characters like Holmes and Watson or Spencer and Hawk long ago discovered, once you have found a good fictional recipe, it doesn't pay to change it.</p>
        <p>Is this, then, the end of the line for the O'Brian series? Napoleon, against whom Aubrey and Maturin have waged an almost personal battle through 19 works, is now en route -- on a Royal Navy frigate -- to lasting exile on St. Helena; and the ''Great War'' (as 19th-century Britons called it) is over. Yet, in the last paragraph, as Aubrey's warship casts off from Gibraltar on its passage home, he is urged to ''liberate Chile.'' Since the real-life character whom it is thought Aubrey most resembles, the great frigate captain Thomas Cochrane, left the Royal Navy in 1814 and went on to fight for Chile and Peru against Spanish rule in South America, it seems a fair guess that our famous duo will shortly reappear in that very hemisphere for further adventures.</p>
