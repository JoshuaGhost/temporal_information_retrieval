      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Any adult who has dispensed advice to the young knows how much weight children give such guidance. But when a girl has some advice for another girl, all ears are open. In fact, ''Ask Any Girl,'' a book of girl-to-girl advice published last year was so well received that the publisher, Beyond Words, of Hillsboro, Ore., has just issued ''Ask Any Girl 2'' ($8.95). One of the 47 contributors, aged 7 to 16, is Keeley Stalnaker, a 12-year-old from High Bridge who is in the seventh grade at Gill St. Bernard's School in Gladstone. Her tips for girls who want to start a business were chosen from 600 submissions. Other topics in the book include how to tell if you are right- or left-brained, what to do when your best friend ditches you, overcoming shyness and having fun while you're grounded. If there's a third volume, Keeley, who appeared at her first book signing yesterday at the Clinton Bookshop in Clinton, might tell other girls how to handle fame.</p>
