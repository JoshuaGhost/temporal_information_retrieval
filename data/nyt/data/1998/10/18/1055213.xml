        <p>Brooklyn detectives are searching for a ring of men suspected of posing as utility employees to gain entry to the homes of elderly residents and rob them, the police said.</p>
        <p>In more than 35 robberies attributed to the gang, which began operating in southern Brooklyn in August, the suspects have walked up to the victims' front doors wearing yellow hard hats and reflective vests, the police said. The men say they need to get inside to check the water, gas or electricity, the police said. Then, while one man distracts the victim, the others ransack the home.</p>

        <p>Brooklyn detectives are searching for a ring of men suspected of posing as utility employees to gain entry to the homes of elderly residents and rob them, the police said.</p>
        <p>In more than 35 robberies attributed to the gang, which began operating in southern Brooklyn in August, the suspects have walked up to the victims' front doors wearing yellow hard hats and reflective vests, the police said. The men say they need to get inside to check the water, gas or electricity, the police said. Then, while one man distracts the victim, the others ransack the home.</p>
        <p>The police described the main suspect, who does most of the talking, as 35 to 45 years old, about 5 feet 10 inches tall, with an olive complexion. He usually wears a yellow hard hat, a gray safety construction vest, a blue shirt and blue pants. They said that the other suspects are white males ranging in age from 20 to 60 years old, and that one 20-year-old has a missing front tooth.</p>
        <p>All of the suspects speak with an accent, possibly Eastern European, and communicate with each other during the robberies through walkie-talkies, the police said. They have arrived at their robbery locations in various vehicles, described by the police as a red Jeep, a gray Jeep Cherokee, a white van with Union Gas written on the door or a red or blue van.</p>
