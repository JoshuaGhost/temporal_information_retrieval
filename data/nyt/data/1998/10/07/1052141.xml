      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial endorses House-passed banking bill that would require banks setting up financial services holding companies to offer low-cost basic banking services, the need for which will greatly increase when new rules go into effect requiring that most recipients of Federal benefits--including Social Security--have the money transferred to them electronically; urges Senate to reinstate this provision in its bill; also urges Senate to overturn decision to strip Comptroller of Currency of important regulatory responsibilities that were left entirely with Federal Reserve</p>

        <p>Making banking services available to citizens who need them has long been a worthy goal, but it will become even more important in January, when new rules require that most recipients of Federal benefits -- including Social Security -- have the money transferred to them electronically. Paper checks will no longer be available.</p>
        <p>That is why one section of the House-passed Financial Services bill was so welcome. It directed Federal regulators to require banks setting up financial services holding companies to offer low-cost basic banking services -- a low-fee checking account with limited withdrawals. Such accounts do not offer the flexibility of more popular accounts, but they are vital for many consumers.</p>

Such accounts do not offer the flexibility of more popular accounts, but they are vital for many consumers.</p>
        <p>The lack of such a provision in the Senate bill is a significant problem. Before that bill is acted upon, the basic banking provision should be reinstated.</p>
        <p>It would also be good if the Senate would overturn a decision to strip the Comptroller of the Currency of important regulatory responsibilities that were left entirely with the Federal Reserve. That far-reaching decision seems to have been made largely because Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is very popular. But banking issues sometimes are very important for the economy, and the people, through officials appointed by the President, should have a say in them.</p>
        <p>The pending bill has many good parts. But if Congress passes the version now pending in the Senate, it may be necessary for President Clinton to veto it and ask the next Congress to do a better job.</p>
