        <p>Comment on rumors about likely candidates for correspondents jobs on '60 Minutes II'--spinoff of popular CBS news magazine that begins early in 1999 (S)</p>

        <p>Because ''60 Minutes'' is the grand old monarch of all network news magazines, the growing pains of its offspring have been matters of great curiosity in the press. Just about any serious television news correspondent not already locked into a dream job has seen his or her name tossed out as a candidate for a correspondent's job on ''60 Minutes II,'' which is  to take a midweek time slot on CBS  early next year.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the span of one week, from last week to this, Chris Wallace of ABC News (whose father, Mike Wallace, is one of the originals on the original ''60 Minutes''), has gone from being labeled can't miss to dismissed as out of the running. (The truth, as of yesterday, remained somewhere in between.)</p>

        <p>Because ''60 Minutes'' is the grand old monarch of all network news magazines, the growing pains of its offspring have been matters of great curiosity in the press. Just about any serious television news correspondent not already locked into a dream job has seen his or her name tossed out as a candidate for a correspondent's job on ''60 Minutes II,'' which is  to take a midweek time slot on CBS  early next year.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the span of one week, from last week to this, Chris Wallace of ABC News (whose father, Mike Wallace, is one of the originals on the original ''60 Minutes''), has gone from being labeled can't miss to dismissed as out of the running. (The truth, as of yesterday, remained somewhere in between.)</p>
        <p>Still considered front-runners are three CBS veterans -- Dan Rather, Bob Simon and Vicki Mabrey -- and one from well outside the bloodlines, PBS's Charlie Rose. Reached yesterday, Mr. Rose said: ''This is going to happen, and I'm so excited.'' He said he would be a contributor rather than a full-time correspondent because he will keep his own weeknight interview program on PBS.</p>
        <p>With all that said, a CBS spokeswoman, Sandy Genelius, had the following comment yesterday: ''Not a single correspondent agreement has been signed yet.''</p>
