        <p>It took minutes for a racist E-mail message to land in the mailboxes of 13 minority students at Boston College last Thursday. It took a few hours more before the whole campus knew about it.</p>
        <p>Prompted by phone calls and fliers that asked ''Will U stand for this?'' more than 1,000 students overflowed an auditorium that night to condemn the act and scrutinize the E-mail, sent to leaders of minority organizations on campus.

        <p>It took minutes for a racist E-mail message to land in the mailboxes of 13 minority students at Boston College last Thursday. It took a few hours more before the whole campus knew about it.</p>
        <p>Prompted by phone calls and fliers that asked ''Will U stand for this?'' more than 1,000 students overflowed an auditorium that night to condemn the act and scrutinize the E-mail, sent to leaders of minority organizations on campus. Of the college's nearly 9,000 undergraduates, about 1,600 are members of minorities.</p>
        <p>''People were screaming, yelling, crying,'' said Annelice Morales, who received the E-mail.</p>
        <p>The message said ''BC is for white men'' and included slurs against people who were Asian, black, Hispanic and gay. ''You all need to go back where you came from,'' it said.</p>
        <p>The university police are investigating whether someone may have used another Boston College student's E-mail account to send the message. The sender, if a student, could face expulsion or suspension, Reid Oslin, a Boston College spokesman, said today.</p>
        <p>Student leaders were encouraged by the strong turnout for the meeting, which included many white students. But the meeting also revealed what Ms. Morales called a hidden tension on campus. Six racist, sexist or antigay graffiti have been reported in the dormitories since the beginning of classes this year.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Boston College as a whole was aware of how often these things happen,'' said Ms. Morales, a sophomore. ''I know in two or three months it's going to be forgotten and things will be the same.''</p>
        <p>Boston College is the latest of several colleges and universities to see hateful E-mail sent on their systems in recent months, including the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and the University of North Carolina. At the University of Maine at Orono, a student was ordered to do community service and had his computer account suspended after he posted a threatening message last year.</p>
        <p>Last week, Congress passed a bill that would require colleges and universities to expand their reporting of hate crimes to include biases based on sex or disability. Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, who sponsored the original bill, also wanted to require the reporting of harassment and vandalism.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately those were stripped out of the bill during conference,'' said Joy Howell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Torricelli. ''We still think it's a problem that needs to be addressed.''</p>
