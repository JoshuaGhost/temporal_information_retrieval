        <p>The Associated Press summary of the House Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday was admirable for its simple, concentrated statement of Washington's political mood and the constitutional quandary presented by a chief executive who has squandered public respect. ''No one -- no Republican, no Democrat -- defended Clinton's conduct with Ms. Lewinsky or his testimony while under oath,'' The A.P. said. ''The issue was whether the President's behavior constituted events worthy of impeachment.''</p>
        <p>That issue was crisply aired in presentations by David P. Schippers, the counsel for the Republican majority, and by Abbe Lowell, the minority counsel. Mr. Schippers said that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, had documented that Mr. Clinton lied under oath. He also said that in his view Mr. Clinton had worked energetically to obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses and suppress evidence sought. As for the argument that he was only lying about sexual conduct, not affairs of state, Mr. Schippers pointed out that under his constitutional oath the President cannot pick those legal proceedings in which his word is good and give himself a license to lie in others. The details of the underlying case ''are of no significance whatever,'' Mr. Schippers said. ''It is the oath itself that is sacred and must be enforced.''</p>

        <p>The Associated Press summary of the House Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday was admirable for its simple, concentrated statement of Washington's political mood and the constitutional quandary presented by a chief executive who has squandered public respect. ''No one -- no Republican, no Democrat -- defended Clinton's conduct with Ms. Lewinsky or his testimony while under oath,'' The A.P. said. ''The issue was whether the President's behavior constituted events worthy of impeachment.''</p>
        <p>That issue was crisply aired in presentations by David P. Schippers, the counsel for the Republican majority, and by Abbe Lowell, the minority counsel. Mr. Schippers said that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, had documented that Mr. Clinton lied under oath. He also said that in his view Mr. Clinton had worked energetically to obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses and suppress evidence sought. As for the argument that he was only lying about sexual conduct, not affairs of state, Mr. Schippers pointed out that under his constitutional oath the President cannot pick those legal proceedings in which his word is good and give himself a license to lie in others. The details of the underlying case ''are of no significance whatever,'' Mr. Schippers said. ''It is the oath itself that is sacred and must be enforced.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowell put the opposing view as cogently as possible. Congress should regard Mr. Clinton's testimony as ''misstatements'' about a case that came to naught. The President's testimony, ''whether truthful or not,'' does not have the constitutional gravity that warrants impeachment or removal. Such steps require ''a far higher threshold'' than has been reached in falsehoods designed to cover a sexual escapade. Mr. Starr, he asserted, had tried to ''usurp the constitutional role of the House''  by declaring President Clinton impeachable instead of making a neutral presentation of evidence.</p>
        <p>From our point of view, these arguments, taken together, show yet again how essential it is to reach a negotiated settlement that involves heavy censure and an unqualified admission of lying by Mr. Clinton. It would be disruptive to remove him unless serious crimes are proved. But great damage to the American political and legal system would ensue from adopting Mr. Lowell's argument that the nation's chief law enforcement officer can swear to tell the truth and then lie for political convenience, to cover affronts to the dignity of his office or to protect his family from knowledge about his personal conduct. All are understandable human impulses, but the rule of law is too important for this country to grant an exemption for Presidential foolishness.</p>
        <p>There are signs of movement toward an acceptable resolution. Former President Gerald Ford's proposal for condemning the President in the well of the House spurred discussion of truncating the impeachment process. This past weekend, the White House held back its talk-show attack squad. The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, declared a willingness to conclude his committee's deliberations by the end of the year. Sooner would be better, but the Democrats have to shop harder for a deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schippers's stinging recitation of the flurry of phone calls among Mr. Clinton, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan should have convinced the President's lawyers that the last thing they want is impeachment proceedings or a Senate trial on obstruction of justice. Yesterday's hearing should likewise have convinced House Democrats that the Republican majority will never buy Mr. Lowell's theory on the acceptability of miniature lies. But they can probably move the Republicans toward a deal that allows this Presidency to run its full if inevitably disappointing course.</p>
