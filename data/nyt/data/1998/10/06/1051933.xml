        <p>United States Representative Charles E. Rangel lashed out at State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco yesterday, accusing him of concocting a lawsuit against the Apollo Theater Foundation to gain support in his campaign for re-election.</p>
        <p>In the suit, filed last week, the Attorney General contended that the struggling nonprofit foundation, which runs the historic Harlem theater for the state, was rife with mismanagement. The suit seeks the removal of Mr. Rangel, the board chairman, and 5 other members of the 10-member board.</p>
        <p>''I think it's abundantly clear,'' said Mr. Rangel, a Democrat who has represented Harlem for nearly three decades, ''that this action has been brought at a time where the Attorney General thinks that it's politically expedient for him to do this.'' Mr. Vacco, a Republican, is running for a second term in the Nov. 3 elections.</p>
        <p>Commenting on Mr. Rangel's remarks, Marc Wurzel, a spokesman for Mr. Vacco, denied that politics played a role in the lawsuit. ''This action is being taken at this time,'' Mr. Wurzel said, ''in order to prevent the Apollo's officers and directors from doing further harm to one of the city's and one of Harlem's greatest assets.''</p>
        <p>The Attorney General's suit accuses the foundation of failing to collect an estimated $4 million that was owed it by Inner City Theater Group, the producer of the popular television program ''It's Showtime at the Apollo.'' For several months, the state has been investigating the relationship between the foundation and Inner City, which is owned by Mr. Rangel's close friend, Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rangel said Mr. Vacco never conducted an audit of the theater to support the allegation that Inner City earned $16 million in profits from ''Showtime,'' and consequently was obligated under its contract to turn over 25 percent of that sum, or $4 million, to the foundation. The Congressman maintained that Mr. Vacco was simply trying to court upstate voters -- and get the editorial support of The Daily News -- by coming down hard on the Apollo and its board, which consists, Mr. Rangel  said, of respected community leaders, retired business executives and other professionals.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what kind of operation the Attorney General is running,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''But how you can do this to a board of such outstanding people without the benefit of a professional audit, in order to solicit the endorsement of one of the local downstate newspapers, I think violates every rule of ethics anyone can think of.''</p>
        <p>According to the Attorney General's complaint, however, it was the comptroller of the foundation, Tony Morrell, who informed the board that Inner City owed it $4 million for use of the Apollo name and premises. But instead of taking action to verify Mr. Morrell's conclusions, the Apollo accepted a sum of only $145,000 from Inner City, the suit said. Mr. Rangel said that the foundation had commissioned its own audit, but he did not know when it would be completed.</p>
        <p>He said that the board had met yesterday morning and voted to hire a lawyer to respond to the suit and to investigate whether a countersuit could be filed against the Attorney General.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed one day after the Apollo settled a five-week strike with its newly unionized stagehands.</p>
        <p>The Attorney General's office is expected to file papers this week asking a judge to appoint a temporary receiver to take control of the Apollo.</p>
