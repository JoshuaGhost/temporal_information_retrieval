        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* CHAVA ALBERSTEIN AND THE KLEZMATICS, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Chava Alberstein is one of Israel's leading pop singers, with a voice full of tenderness. Most of the albums she has recorded over the last three decades have been sung in Hebrew with arrangements that touch on pop, rock and Middle Eastern music. But ''The Well,'' her most recent album, is a collaboration with the Klezmatics, the New York klezmer band; it was produced by Ben Mink, who was K. D. Lang's instrumental wizard. The songs set Yiddish poems to Ms. Alberstein's traditional-sounding melodies, and the Klezmatics provide poised oom-pahs and fondly understated ballad arrangements, a perfect match for her voice. The Klezmatics and Ms. Alberstein are to perform separately and then together. Tomorrow at 8:30 P.M.; tickets are $25 and $30 (Jon Pareles).</p>

        <p>THE BAD LIVERS, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. This punk rock bluegrass trio first gained notice with an unlikely set list of covers that paid tribute to rustic artists like Iggy Pop and Metallica. Now the group is just as beloved for its own rollicking tunes, which inspired the soundtrack it provided for the western directed by Richard Linklater, ''The Newton Boys.'' Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $15 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>HAMIET BLUIETT, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. The baritone saxophonist has one of jazz's great sounds, dense and hard. He's best on ballads, where he can work a melody the way a melody should be worked. And there's news: his band includes the drummer Billy Higgins, only one of the most important drummers in the history of jazz. His sound is joy turned into music. Shows  on Friday and Saturday nights are at 9, 11 and 12:30; the cover is $20 with a $10 minimum. On Sunday the sets are at 9 and 11 P.M.; the cover is $17.50 and the minimum is $10 (Peter Watrous).</p>
        <p>* DAVID BYRNE, Knitting Factory, Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The Balanescu Quartet, a London-based classical string group, is developing a reputation as a kind of classy way station on the rock star's path toward the inevitable PBS ''American Masters'' special: it backed Elvis Costello several years ago, and now it'll be the canvas for David Byrne's latest project. Who knows what it will sound like; Mr. Byrne has cast his net unusually wide in the 90's, and even a retrospective of old material will come off as tremendously varied. The engagement lasts through Monday; tonight and tomorrow, sets are at 8 and 11, Sunday and Monday at 8 only. Only standing-room tickets, at $18, remain. (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* THE CHURCH, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. The last time the Church played in New York, seven years ago, Steve Kilbey's husky voice and brooding lyrics were all but washed away by the band's endlessly recombinant guitars. Chords murmured and pealed; riffs curled and twined like Victorian ironwork; drones purred and shimmered, in a blissful triumph of pure sound. Tonight at 9 P.M., with the Rosenbergs and Poem Rocket opening; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>OSCAR D'LEON, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212)  582-2672 He's one of the most influential and important salsa stars to arrive in the last 25 years, a powerful singer and bassist and band leader. His groups, with their tight choreography, put on shows, with Mr. D'Leon leading the band. And when he plays bass, the music elevates. Mr. D'Leon and his band will be joined by Colombia's best-known salsa group, Grupo Niche. It will be a dance party; Mr. D'Leon will be performing next Tuesday and next Friday as well. The show this Saturday starts at 11; there's a $30 cover (Watrous).</p>
        <p>THE FLESHTONES, Nightingale, 213 Second Avenue, at 13th Street, East Village, (212) 473-9398). Year in and year out, the Fleshtones have held on to the sound of 1960's garage-rock. Once it sounded like punk; now it's starting to sound like die-hard purism. They'll be at Nightingale every Saturday in October, with sets at midnight; admission is $5 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FUNKY METERS, at Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. The Funky Meters include Art Neville on keyboards and George Porter Jr. on bass from the Meters, the band that was the cornerstone of New Orleans funk. With Russell Batiste on drums, they still set up grooves and syncopations that carry every hip into irresistible motion. Tomorrow at 8 P.M. and midnight, with Liquid Soul opening; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ROY HAYNES, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. There are very few people in the history of jazz who have acquitted themselves so well in so many esthetic fields.  Mr. Haynes has played drums for Lester Young and John Coltrane. He's hired Rahasaan Roland Kirk. And he has kept one of the most exciting bands in jazz going for the last decade; Ron Blake, a careful, imaginative tenor saxophonist will be the band's horn section. Mr. Haynes is unstoppable, a musician who embodies improvisation and makes jazz styles seem insignificant in the face of his inventions. Shows through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M.; a $20 cover tonight and tomorrow and a $15 cover on Sunday, with a  $10 minimum for all shows. (Watrous).</p>
        <p>INDIA, Latin Quarter, 2551 Broadway at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600. She's a screamer, the Latin Janet Jackson, constantly talking about the revenge she's going to get on that bad ex-man of hers. She does it with about as much extroversion as can be found on the American stage, and one of the best salsa bands working backs her up. She'll be joined by Tito Rojas, from Puerto Rico, a strong singer and a bit of a bellower himself. The show tomorrow night starts at 11; the cover is $25 (Watrous).</p>
        <p>RAIS KHAN and RASHID KHAN, Symphony Space Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The sitarist Rais Khan and the vocalist Radhid Khan, two acclaimed (and unrelated) Indian classical musicians, share this bill, performing ragas and other improvisational pieces. Tonight at 8. Tickets are $26 to $35, $21 for World Music Institute members and members of Symphony Space (Pareles).</p>
        <p>GLADYS KNIGHT, Theater at Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue between 33d and 34th Streets, (212) 465-6741. The journalist Kathy Dobie once wrote that Gladys Knight's distinctive talent comes from the fact that she sounds like a grown woman, the kind who can make sense of heartbreak because she has endured it more than once. Her passion is always tempered by reality, and she has given voice to some of the saddest, most pensive songs in rhythm-and-blues. But she also has a smile that can warm the heart of the most jaded lover, and she'll surely turn on both sides of her charm tonight. Sunday at 7 P.M.; tickets are $100, $50 and $25 (Powers).</p>
        <p>CHRIS KNOX, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street between Delancey and Rivington Streets, East Village, (212) 358-7503. Chris Knox is a 45-year-old New Zealander and a pro-choice, pro-sex, unchurched anarchist vegetarian whose heart-tugging songs about committed love and bohemian ethics have made him a Yoda-like elder figure within the international pop underground. His hilariously fractured onstage rants well complement his bang-on-a-can style of pop, which borrows equally from Paul McCartney and the noise-rock guru Captain Beefheart. Sunday at 9 and 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>MAN OR ASTRO-MAN?, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street at the Bowery, East Village, (212) 533-2111. Surf guitar meets science fiction in Man or Astro-Man?, which laces its rowdy instrumentals with B-movie snippets about the future. Tonight at 10, with Clone Project Alpha and Famous Monsters opening; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARCE ET TUMPAK, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. What a rocking little band. Straight from Martinique, the group, using mostly percussion instruments, goes right to the groove and stays there. The melodies, sung and played on flute, float over the hard swing of the band. It's Saturday night music, for parties and love and fun, and once the rhythms get you, it's hard not to be transported. And it's one of the best bands in the Caribbean, which is saying something. The show tonight starts at 12, and the cover is $15 (Watrous).</p>
        <p>* MARY LOU LORD, ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO and PETER CASE, at Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street at the Bowery, East Village,  (212) 533-2111. Three songwriters share this triple bill and cover a lot of emotional territory. Mary Lou Lord, who alternates her own songs with gems by Nick Saloman of the Bevis Frond and others, is winsome and lovelorn; Alejandro Escovedo delves into loss and stoic despair, and Peter Case can be a wise guy or a precise observer of the down-and-out. Tomorrow at 10 P.M.; admission is $12 today and $14 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MINI-KING, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street at Great Jones Street, NoHo, (212) 533-2680. This smooth and groovy New York band takes a little bit from the cocktail nation and a little from New Romantics like Spandau Ballet. The producer Phil Ramone, who has backed a few hitmakers in his time (can you say Billy Joel?) was impressed enough to sign the group to his label, N2K. Mike Errico, a singer-songwriter with a soulful edge, opens the show. Friday at 8 P.M.; tickets are $8; and there is a two-drink minimum (Powers).</p>
        <p>JOHN PATITUCCI, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. The curve of Mr. Patitucci's recent career proves that making electric-bass technique videos isn't the apex of a jazz career: he has removed much of the distracting polish off of his art and taken a serious run at the mainstream.  Here he plays with a high-caliber quartet, including the perpetually undervalued tenor saxophonist George Garzone, another guy for whom the possessive adulation of jazz students has probably been more limiting than enriching. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25 with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>BARRE PHILLIPS, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. There are only a small handful of improvising solo-bass virtuosos, and the seldom-seen Mr. Phillips is one of them. He's merciless on his instrument, but always gravitates toward beauty, usually through playing games with the textures of his string sounds.  Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 9:30;  cover charge, $8; $5 minimum. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE RADIATORS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The second-line backbeat of New Orleans funk is the heartbeat of the Radiators, a long-running rock band that sings about woman trouble and other frustrations while it keeps people shimmying on the dance floor. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 P.M.; tickets are $22.50 in advance, $25 on day of show (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ROYAL CROWN REVUE, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan(212) 247-0200. The first band of substance to rise (10 years ago) out of the fascination for all things Louis Prima, and still probably the best, Royal Crown Revue has vivid stage presence to go with its vintage ties, wallet chains and tattoos. With the Flying Neutrinos, one of New York's most popular neo-swing bands, the latest such group to be tapped by a major record label (it's Impulse: a real jazz label, no less). The show is tonight at 7:30. Tickets are $18.50, available through Ticketmaster, (212) 307-7171 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>RUN-DMC, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street (212) 727-7788. The definitive old-school rappers conquered the rock audience by keeping things simple: Jam Master Jay's stark boom-chunk beats, and the two rappers' shout-along rhymes and down-to-earth boasts. Run's embrace of Christianity won't keep the group from summoning the days when a pair of Adidas, not a Lexus, was a status symbol of hip-hop locomotion. Sunday at 9 P.M., with the Large Professor and Non-Phixion sharing the bill. Tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MERCEDES SOSA, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5030. In her native Argentina, Mercedes Sosa is like Joan Baez and Linda Ronstadt rolled into one: a pop singer steeped in folk music who lends her warm, dignified voice to songs with a conscience. At her annual New York concerts, she is greeted like a national heroine. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $45, $50 and $55 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TOM TOM CLUB, LOWEN and NAVARRO, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. This odd double bill will have earnest countrified folk fans mingling with veteran booty-shaking hipsters. Lowen and Navarro are a signer-songwriter duo whose plaintive songs look at middle age through an angst-ridden bohemian lens. Tom Tom Club still consists of Chris Franz and Tina Weymouth, the famous married rhythm section from the Talking Heads, and whoever they choose to help them cook up some Caribbean-sauced funk. The singer Charles Pettigrew is their main ally these days. Friday at 10 P.M. ; tickets are $15 (Powers).</p>
        <p>TONY VEGA, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2672. Two strong salseros, Mr. Vega and Tito Nieves, will be there to improvise. They'll be joined by the long, tall and lean Tono Rosario, a nonstop Dominican merengue singer. Everybody has hits, and one can be sure that everybody will be singing them, too. Tonight's show starts at 11; there is a $20 minimum (Watrous).</p>
        <p>ANDREAS VOLLENWEIDER, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 875-5050. The Swiss-born New Age harpist calls himself a musical nomad, and he sure wanders on ''Kryptos,'' his latest album:  it incorporates Japanese percussion, a capella vocals from Ladysmith Black Mambazo, saxophone by Michael Brecker, Mongolian and Gregorian chant, and more. For this show, however, Master Vollenweider will perform solo, on the amplified harp he compares to a 100-pound apple: ''The principle of an apple doesn't change just because you feed it with artificial stuff or chemicals to make it grow. . . . its essence is the same as when it grows naturally on the tree.'' Deep. Friday at 8 P.M.; tickets are $40, $35, $30, and $25 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* DAVID S. WARE QUARTET, Fez, under Time Cafe, 380 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Mr. Ware, a tenor saxophonist, locked his group concept in place about seven years ago: thick, urgent and slablike, with Matthew Shipp's dense clusters setting the baleful mood and William Parker's peripatetic bass figures giving it forward motion. As he never tires of saying, his music isn't free jazz: there are melodies and arrangements in there. But it is aggressive. The band's Columbia records debut album, ''Go See the World,'' gives the band a higher-visibility occasion to show off what it does best, if the youth subculture it plays to hasn't thoroughly discovered it already. Sunday night; sets are at 9 and 11 P.M.; there is a $12 cover charge and a two-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
