        <p>Before this National League Championship Series began, John Smoltz had warned that no matter what happened to the Braves this year, when Atlanta fans looked back on the 1990's they would finally realize how good they had it during an era when their team played in seven league championship series in a row.</p>
        <p>When the Braves think back over the last two seasons, though, all they are likely to have are bad memories of Kevin Brown.</p>
        <p>For the third consecutive time in the last two league championship series, Brown took it to the Braves. Brown, a 33-year-old right-hander, tossed a three-hit shutout tonight, striking out 11. He even singled twice, during the game's only two fruitful rallies, as the San Diego Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, before 43,083 fans at Turner Field.</p>
        <p>Because of Brown, who has now defeated Atlanta six straight times dating from September 1996, the Padres are heading back to San Diego with a two-games-to-none lead over the heavily favored Braves. And history is on the Padres' side: since the league championship series went to a four-of-seven-game format in 1985, no team from either league has advanced to the World Series after losing the first two games at home.</p>
        <p>''What more could we want at this point?'' said Brown, who guarded a 1-0 lead through the eighth inning tonight, until the Padres were able to capitalize on a number of defensive breakdowns to score twice more in the ninth and put away the game. ''It's huge to win the first two games. I think it was a real moral victory for us to come in here and play like this against this caliber of a team, considering the pitching we were going to face.''</p>
        <p>Not that the Padres, who slipped past Smoltz and Tom Glavine the first two games, are taking anything for granted. As Tony Gwynn cautioned: ''There's still a lot of work to be done. Greg Maddux is throwing for them on Saturday. And that's no day at the beach, either.''</p>
        <p>But even if the Braves somehow scrap their way back into this series, they will eventually have to face Brown one more time.</p>
        <p>And considering that Brown, who scattered three singles tonight, defeated Atlanta twice during the Florida Marlins' six-game upset of the defending league champions in the N.L.C.S. last fall, it was fairly easy to see why the Padres were optimistic about their chances today.</p>
        <p>Brown had struck out 16 batters in Game 1 of San Diego's first-round victory over the Houston Astros, before allowing just one run in six and two-thirds innings four days later in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''When Kevin Brown is on, he's as tough as any pitcher in the game,'' Padres Manager Bruce Bochy said tonight. ''He's as tough a competitor as I've ever seen. He feels good right now. He's just locked in.''</p>
        <p>If you ask Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox, he would probably say he has seen enough of Brown.</p>
        <p>''Against our club, this was the best I've ever seen him pitch,'' Cox said.</p>
        <p>Brown, whose fastball topped off at 96 miles an hour, said: ''I think I threw everything but the kitchen sink out there tonight. I was just winging it, making stuff up as I went.''</p>
        <p>Which was fortunate for the Padres, who were without their best power hitter, Greg Vaughn, who strained his left quadriceps muscle on the wet outfield grass of Turner Field chasing a ball on Wednesday. Vaughn could be out for the rest of the series. ''The doctors think possibly three to four days, but it could be up to 10 days,'' Bochy said.</p>
        <p>Vaughn, who hit a career-high 50 homers this season, said, ''I don't know how long they said I'm going to be out, but it's not going to be that long.''</p>
        <p>Vaughn said the Padres would probably rest him on Saturday, now that they have a 2-0 lead in games. Tom Glavine was wild. He walked a season-high six tonight, including Ken Caminiti in his first three at-bats, and Wally Joyner in his first two. But none of the walks hurt Glavine, who threw 31 pitches in the second inning and 26 in the third, and left the bases loaded both times.</p>
        <p>Brown was a little sharper. He struck out the side in the first, but walked the first two batters he faced in the second, before pitching out of the jam. Two innings later, Brown was able to induce Javy Lopez into an inning-ending pop-up to left field with runners on second and third.</p>
        <p>By the fifth, Glavine's pitch count had reached 100. An inning later, the Padres finally broke through. With two out and nobody on, Glavine allowed a single between short and third to Chris Gomez, his second hit of the game. Up stepped Brown, who had taken a called third strike to leave the bases loaded in the second.</p>
        <p>On a 1-2 count, Brown grounded a single between short and third, and the Padres, 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position, had runners on first and second.</p>
        <p>This time, they came through. On Glavine's 121st pitch of the game, Quilvio Veras singled up the middle to score Gomez. Andruw Jones's throw from center skipped away from Lopez, but Glavine backed up the play, and his high throw to third was pulled down by Chipper Jones in plenty of time to get the sliding Brown to end the inning.</p>
        <p>But Brown had helped himself to one run. And, after the Padres scored twice more in the ninth after Brown had led off with his second hit of the game, it was more than enough to enable the Padres to travel west with an improbable sweep of the first two games in Atlanta.
