        <p>When the Vatican released Pope John Paul II's latest encyclical on Thursday, it published a document by a trained philosopher who explores and amplifies a historic church position that faith and reason cannot be separated. He does so in a style that some Roman Catholic scholars say might even make it a useful text for undergraduate courses.</p>
        <p>But scholars said the encyclical, ''Fides et Ratio'' (''Faith and Reason''), which was addressed to the bishops, should not be read simply as a document of interest primarily to them and students, but one that comes with a message for a worldwide, growing church. The encyclical contains a critique of past intellectual trends and a look ahead.</p>

        <p>When the Vatican released Pope John Paul II's latest encyclical on Thursday, it published a document by a trained philosopher who explores and amplifies a historic church position that faith and reason cannot be separated. He does so in a style that some Roman Catholic scholars say might even make it a useful text for undergraduate courses.</p>
        <p>But scholars said the encyclical, ''Fides et Ratio'' (''Faith and Reason''), which was addressed to the bishops, should not be read simply as a document of interest primarily to them and students, but one that comes with a message for a worldwide, growing church. The encyclical contains a critique of past intellectual trends and a look ahead.</p>
        <p>John Paul II examines and rejects various philosophical trends that he says have abandoned the search for truth. And noting that Christianity is about to enter its third millennium, the Pope declares the church to be reason's defender against intellectuals who have given up on discovering absolute truth.</p>
        <p>The Pope, said the Rev. Avery Dulles, professor of religion and society at Fordham University, is ''saying that the church has a duty to defend human reason and, paradoxically, people outside the church don't seem to be doing it.''</p>
        <p>Philosophy is the Pope's academic specialty. As a priest in Poland, the Rev. Karol Wojtyla received his doctorate in the subject from Jagiellonian University in Cracow in 1960. But his encyclical proclaims anew ideas with a long history in Catholic thinking.</p>
        <p>''It's a timely restatement of a particular position that goes back to the 13th century and was re-emphasized in the 19th century but particularly needs to be said today,'' Father Dulles said. ''I think it comes from his heart.''</p>
        <p>The 150-page document contains some specialized language in its discussion of trends in philosophy. But some sections are written in a style accessible to a broader audience. In its earliest chapters, for example, the Pope says that some questions -- like ''Who am I?'' and ''Does life have a meaning?'' -- are universal.</p>
        <p>In so doing, he strikes at a resonant chord with contemporary culture, in which much public discussion has focused on the need to re-establish a sense of community and discover shared social values.</p>
        <p>''It's very upbeat in its overall tone,'' said the Rev. Robert Sokolowski, who teaches philosophy at Catholic University of America, in Washington, in an assessment echoed by others who have read the encyclical. ''It's kind of an exhortation to be confident in the discoveries of reason.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It's also very important that he sees religion and faith as not destroying reason. You don't have to abandon your intellect when you believe.''</p>
        <p>Some scholars who read the encyclical said that they could imagine it having a classroom use. ''I teach a course in philosophy of religion,'' said the Rev. Brian Shanley, who teaches philosophy at Catholic University. ''This is the kind of document that I might want the students to look at to reiterate the classical line.''</p>
        <p>Father Shanley also saw a wider application for the encyclical, which contains sections stating that the faith's essentials remain constant regardless of the surrounding culture, no matter what part of the world the church is in.</p>
        <p>''The word of God is not addressed to any one people or to any one period of history,'' the Pope wrote. ''Similarly, dogmatic statements, while reflecting at times the culture of the period in which they were defined, formulate an unchanging and ultimate truth.''</p>
        <p>The encyclical mounts a defense of the church's ability to proclaim its faith against postmodern philosophical tendencies.</p>
        <p>''When philosophy is saying all truth claims are relative,'' Father Shanley said, then the challenge the church faces is that it becomes more difficult to teach that all believers should be bound by the decisions of church councils that took place in past centuries in Europe.</p>
        <p>One of most important trends of the Pope's 20-year reign has been a geographic shift of the world's Catholic population toward the Southern Hemisphere. Between 1976 and 1995, Catholics in Africa and Asia together grew from 14 percent of the church's members to 20 percent, according to church statistics. By contrast, the Catholic population of Europe has been largely stable.</p>
