        <p>BREEDERS' CUP  Coronado's Quest Will Run in Classic</p>
        <p>Coronado's Quest, whose five-race winning streak was snapped by Skip Away in the Woodward, will make his final career start on Nov. 7 in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>He's been doing very well since the Woodward, Buzzy Tenney, the assistant trainer to Shug McGaughey, said yesterday. The owner Stuart Janney 3d was in agreement. We know it's going to be a very, very competitive race, but the horse deserves the chance, he said.</p>
        <p>One of three top 3-year-olds headed to the mile-and-a-quarter Classic, along with the Belmont Stakes winner, Victory Gallop, and the Super Derby winner, Arch, Coronado's Quest will mee, among others, Skip Away, Silver Charm, Awesome Again and possibly Gentlemen. Should Gentlemen run in the Mile instead of the Classic, Corey Nakatani will have the mount on Coronado's Quest, Tenney said.</p>
        <p>N.Y.R.A.  An End Is SeenTo OTB Impasse</p>
        <p>Terry Meyocks, the New York Racing Association president and chief operating officer, said he thought the yearlong impasse between the N.Y.R.A. and New York City OTB is about to end. We've had some meaningful discussions, Meyocks said. Hopefully, it will be resolved shortly. N.Y.R.A.'s contract and its extensions with New York City OTB expired on Nov. 12, 1997.</p>
        <p>With the in-home signal absent for the entire Belmont meet and the parlor and teletheater signal pulled for the final week, wagering on the meet at New York City OTB was down almost 25 percent from wagering a year ago, to about  $42.5 million from about $55.7 million.</p>
        <p>Attendance at the 33-day meet was up 5.9 percent, with the on-track handle down just one-half of 1 percent and the total handle down 1 percent. Average daily attendance was 7,428 compared with 7,015 last year, with the daily average handle down to $1,842,434 from $1,852,924 and the daily average handle down to $9,032,103 from $9,137,538.</p>
        <p>BELMONT  Mott and Chavez Win Meet Titles</p>
        <p>Bill Mott, whose tenure atop the Saratoga trainers standing was thwarted by Todd Pletcher, won the Belmont trainers title, 17-14, over Gasper Moschera.</p>
        <p>Jorge Chavez edged Jerry</p>
        <p>Bailey, 43-39, for the jockeys title.</p>
        <p>Racing Moves To Aqueduct Today</p>
        <p>Thoroughbred action moves from Belmont Park to Aqueduct today, with six and a half months of racing to be conducted through May 9, 1999. More than $1.75 million was spent to upgrade the facilities.</p>
        <p>Opening day will feature the $75,000 Discovery, which drew a field of 10 3-year-olds headed by Deputy Diamond, Limit Out, Rock And Roll and Comic Strip.</p>
        <p>Racing will normally run Wednesday through Sunday with post time of 12:30 P.M., with the first exception next Tuesday, Election Day. The track will be closed the following day. The fall and winter meet will conclude Dec. 31.</p>
