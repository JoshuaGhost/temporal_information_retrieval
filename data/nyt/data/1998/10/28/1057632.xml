        <p>The real reason for keeping Jonathan J. Pollard, the American convicted of spying for Israel, in jail has nothing to do with his knowledge of secrets (front page, Oct. 24). Mr. Pollard is kept in jail because the American intelligence community believes that he may lead it to a high-placed mole inside United States intelligence.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The real reason for keeping Jonathan J. Pollard, the American convicted of spying for Israel, in jail has nothing to do with his knowledge of secrets (front page, Oct. 24). Mr. Pollard is kept in jail because the American intelligence community believes that he may lead it to a high-placed mole inside United States intelligence.</p>
        <p>I served in the Israeli Knesset during the Pollard affair and researched the case after I returned to private life. After Mr. Pollard was arrested, American investigators were puzzled by the fact that while spying, he had asked by code references for files and documents whose existence he shouldn't even have suspected. That led the investigators to believe that somebody was feeding these code references to Mr. Pollard and that this somebody was a mole high in the hierarchy who had an overview of the intelligence community.</p>
        <p>Such a mole was never found,but the intelligence community continued to suspect that he existed and that Mr. Pollard knew his identity. That is the reason that a spy who looks like a choirboy compared with Aldrich Ames is still in prison.</p>
