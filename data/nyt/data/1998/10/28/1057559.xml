        <p>Maybe he ate bad peanuts on the Concorde from London this morning. Whatever it was, Prince Naseem Hamed blew into town, breezed through a 1-hour-10-minute workout, and then blew his stack, blasting a couple of reporters during an interview session before stalking out of a meeting room at Bally's Park Place Casino late this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Hamed (30-0), the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion, arrived in town just four days before his fight with Wayne McCullough (22-1) at Atlantic City Convention Center in a 12-round featherweight title bout on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>His delay was caused by his concern over his $2 million payment -- HBO, which will televise the bout  Saturday night, had guaranteed that he would get it -- and that he did not get a visa until the last minute. So here he was, four days late and in a bad mood. Call him the prickly Prince.</p>
        <p>Hamed always trains as if he has a taxi waiting with the meter running. Today's session was no different. The music blared as he danced and pranced his way through workouts with pads, punching the speed bag and jumping rope. And it was done to the total amusement of his huge entourage.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old fighter looked soft around the middle, but his conditioning coach, Dominic Ingle, said Hamed always looked like that and that it was not an indication that he had been bouncing his 4-month-old son, Sami, on his knee more than he had been bouncing his gloves off some poor sparring partner's head.</p>
        <p>Ingle said Hamed had been training for eight weeks in Sheffield, England, his hometown, and had been on a more nutritious diet that included vitamin supplements and amino acid powders that were meant to help him recover more quickly between workouts.</p>
        <p>When this afternoon's workout was over, Hamed sat down to talk with reporters. He used the occasion to rip McCullough; to announce that he was more mellow now that he was married and had a baby son, and to verbally bully Colin Hart of The Sun in London, whom he said had been unfairly critical of him.</p>
        <p>''Wayne McCullough is going to get hurt,'' Hamed said. ''This could be his last fight. I'm going to smash him to bits.''</p>
        <p>Hamed said he had been waiting for two years to fight McCullough, and in that period his anger had been festering.</p>
        <p>It all started when McCullough showed up at Hamed's weigh-in before his bout against Manuel Medina on Aug. 31, 1996. Hamed said that McCullough had harangued him at the weigh-in.</p>
        <p>''You just don't do that the day before someone gets into the ring, especially if you're not the one he's fighting,'' Hamed said.</p>
        <p>Worse, in Hamed's view, McCullough showed up at the fight, which was held in Dublin, McCullough's hometown, and during the breaks between the rounds, McCullough would stand up, hold his arms over his head, and the crowd would cheer McCullough's name. It was disconcerting and humiliating for Hamed, who is accustomed to being the center of attention whenever he enters a room.</p>
        <p>''McCullough has plenty of Irish supporters,'' said Brendan Ingle, Hamed's trainer. ''And if he had been in the fight, then it would have been on the level. He wasn't. He waited until Naz was at a disadvantage to do what he did. Naz shouldn't have even been in the fight. He had a chest infection. Frank Warren tried to get Naz to pull out of the fight, but he wouldn't. So, Naz says it's payback time for McCullough.''</p>
        <p>Ingle and Hamed, who have been working together for 17 years, are trying to mend their relationship, because Ingle criticized Hamed in a book written by Nick Pitt, a reporter with The Sun Times in London, that was published in September. Hart reviewed the book for The Sun, and Hamed believes that Hart chose the parts of the book that made him look bad.</p>
        <p>Today, Hamed continually attacked Hart, and at one point the exchange got so heated that Hamed's father, Sal, stood up and told Hamed to sit down and be quiet. Hamed ignored his father.</p>
        <p>''If you were any good, and a decent man at all, you'd start writing about somebody who is the best in their country and try to build them up and try to give them more confidence,'' Hamed said.</p>
        <p>After the dust-up was over, Hamed said, ''Cheers'' and left.  BOXING</p>
