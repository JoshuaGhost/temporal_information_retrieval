        <p>There tend to be two sorts of regulatory disputes in the communications industry: the wildly Byzantine and the merely arcane.</p>
        <p>The Byzantine seemed on display at the Supreme Court last Tuesday as some of the nation's most prominent lawyers wrangled over the Federal Communications Commission's plan for bringing competition to local telephone markets. They relied not on broad constitutional principles but on subtle interpretations of dense subsections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.</p>
        <p>But the complexity of the courtroom arguments tended to obscure something that became clear later in the week: Some factions within the local telephone industry might actually prefer to lose a big part of this  case in the interest of expediting a more important victory later.</p>
        <p>At stake are the terms under which the local telephone incumbents -- the five Bells and the GTE Corporation -- must open their networks to competitors, be they upstarts or long-distance carriers hoping to enter the local business. The local telephone market is worth about $100 billion.</p>
        <p>''The court realizes that the telecommunications industry is essentially the central industry,'' said William P. Barr, the former Attorney General who is now chief counsel for GTE and who argued before the court on Tuesday. ''This case raised fundamental issues about how competition will unfold and the structure of that market in the future.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 became law, the F.C.C. issued an order that told the states how to set prices for the various elements of the local phone companies' networks that competitors might want to use. In that order, the commission did at least two things that the Bells and GTE despised.</p>
        <p>The first was to mandate what is known as a ''forward-looking'' pricing model. Under such a system, a local incumbent is allowed to recover only those costs that it would bear if its network were of the most modern and efficient type. An equivalent would be if a taxi driver charged customers based on the costs of operating his car but was told to pretend  that his car got 50 miles to the gallon and was in tip-top shape.</p>
        <p>The long-distance companies think that is a great idea because it gives them cost-effective access to local networks without having to bear the cost of building such networks themselves. ''It is not economically possible to build loops to every house in America,'' Bruce J. Ennis Jr., who argued for the newly merged long-distance giant MCI Worldcom Inc. at the Supreme Court, said in an interview, referring to copper telephone lines. ''We need to be able to lease elements from the incumbents.''</p>
        <p>But many taxis, and many equivalent phone networks, are decrepit gas-guzzlers. The local phone companies think they should be allowed to pass along the sometimes higher costs of maintaining and operating even the oldest parts of their networks to the new carriers that want access to those systems.</p>
        <p>Not long after the F.C.C. order came out, the Bells and GTE sued the Government, charging that the Telecommunications Act did not give the commission authority to tell the states to use a forward-looking pricing system. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis agreed. Significantly, the court did not rule on the merits of the commission's rules -- whether forward-looking price models were fair to begin with.</p>
        <p>The local phone carriers also challenged another provision of the F.C.C.'s order, which forced them to offer the different parts of their networks as complete packages for their competitors, largely alleviating the need for their rivals to do such assembly work themselves. The St. Louis court ruled against the commission on that score, as well, and both issues were argued at the Supreme Court last week.</p>
        <p>The commission's uniform national pricing rules never went into effect, forcing the Bells and their competitors to take up the matter in proceedings before 50 different state utility commissions. The upshot, though, is that many, if not most, of the states have adopted forward-looking pricing schemes similar to what the commission proposed two years ago anyway -- and which the local phone companies had hoped to avoid. If the Bells and GTE want to appeal those state decisions, they must litigate state by state.</p>
        <p>So now comes the rub for the Bells and GTE. Remember: the Eighth Circuit, which has already demonstrated sympathy for the local companies, never ruled on whether the forward-looking cost models were fair. If the local phone industry succeeds in convincing the Supreme Court that authority to set local-network pricing models does lie with the states and not with the commission, the fairness question has no chance of rebounding to the Eighth Circuit.</p>
        <p>So now, some lawyers for the local phone industry are thinking that it may actually be better for them to lose in the Supreme Court by having the justices declare that the commission does indeed have jurisdiction. That would send the case back to the Eighth Circuit. And that way, the local companies could hope to have the lower court consider the merits of forward-looking pricing -- and perhaps declare it unfair across the country. ''I think there's a good chance that we lose on jurisdiction,'' said a lawyer who works for a local phone company. ''And to me, No. 1, it's not that bad.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome, an Eighth Circuit ruling on the merits of forward-looking pricing might end up with the same parties back before the Supreme Court. But for the Bells and GTE, some of their proponents believe, a loss now might be the best chance at eventual victory.</p>
