        <p>Mideast Peace Talks Continue Past Deadline  Talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on an interim peace accord will continue past their original deadline and into today, despite more than 20 hours of personal involvement by President Clinton, American officials announced.</p>

        <p>Arrest May Set Precedent  Judge Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish magistrate who succeeded in getting Scotland Yard to arrest Chile's former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, has suddenly moved closer to creating an important legal precedent, one that could make the retirement of former dictators decidedly uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>General Pinochet remained sequestered under police guard in London, awaiting a potentially devastating court hearing to weigh his extradition on charges of genocide, terrorism and murder. British officials have not said where General Pinochet is.</p>

        <p>General Pinochet remained sequestered under police guard in London, awaiting a potentially devastating court hearing to weigh his extradition on charges of genocide, terrorism and murder. British officials have not said where General Pinochet is.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>The popular response in Chile to the sensational news of General Pinochet's arrest in London has been remarkable for its moderation. Public support for the arrest was limited while some protested it as a violation of international law.</p>

        <p>Serbs Begin Withdrawal  Yugoslavia has begun to withdraw two army and police battalions from Kosovo in what NATO and Clinton Administration officials described as a significant step by President Slobodan Milosevic toward complying with demands to end his campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. But the officials said they remained concerned about the pace with which Mr. Milosevic's Government is abiding by the agreement.</p>

        <p>Deadly Explosion in Colombia  An explosion believed to be the work of leftist rebels blew up the country's most important oil pipeline, killing at least 25 people and injuring scores as the Colombian Government prepared for peace talks to end three decades of civil violence.</p>

        <p>Indian-Pakistani Talks End  Indian and Pakistani diplomats announced on the third and final day of talks between the world's two newest nuclear powers that they had agreed only to keep talking to each other about ways to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict between them.</p>

        <p>Inferno Kills 250 in Nigeria  Thieves breaking into an oil pipeline apparently touched off an inferno that destroyed villages and a swath of surrounding cropland, witnesses and officials said. About 250 people were reportedly burned alive.</p>

        <p>Taiwan Talks End in China  A senior official from Taiwan, Koo Chen-fu, left, ended a landmark visit to China after meetings with the Chinese President and Communist Party Leader, Jiang Zemin. They promised to continue talking but reiterated their profoundly different visions about the island's political status. Those differences extend even to what they should discuss.</p>

        <p>Campaign Overhaul Effort Gaining Ground in States  Two very disparate states, Massachusetts so liberal and Arizona so conservative, have become the principal battlegrounds for the struggle over changing campaign financing, with measures on ballots in both states next month. Stymied on the Federal level, the push for cleaner campaigning has moved to the states and appears to be gaining ground.</p>

        <p>A Medicare Predicament  Tens of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries being dropped from health maintenance organizations have suddenly found themselves with no reliable information about their options and no guarantee of coverage for costly prescription drugs. Moreover, the Clinton Administration and the health insurance industry disagree over the protections available to such beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Health Care Merger  The McKesson Corporation, the nation's largest drug distributor, and HBO &amp; Company, the largest supplier of computerized patient-monitoring systems, said they would merge in a stock swap valued at about $14 billion. McKesson HBOC, as it will be called, expects to be the nation's leader in health care services when the deal is completed next spring.</p>

        <p>Talks on Airline Bid  Lawyers for Northwest Airlines were unable to overcome the Clinton Administration's antitrust objections to its bid to buy a controlling stake in Continental Airlines, participants said, but negotiations are to continue this week. The Justice Department would have to file a lawsuit to block the deal.</p>

        <p>Forest Fire in California  Hundreds of firefighters battled a wildfire that had charred 2,200 acres of rugged terrain in the Los Padres National Forest, endangering habitats for threatened species.</p>

        <p>Student Killed at Party  A 22-year-old University of Illinois engineering student was shot and killed and another student was wounded during a fight at a fraternity party. Their names were not released because their families had not been notified. The authorities said the shooting took place at the Omega Delta fraternity house off campus at a homecoming party to raise money for a local Boys and Girls Club. A possible suspect was seen running from the house after the shooting, the police said.</p>

        <p>Jewish Dynamic in Race For Senate Comes to Fore  Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato stood at the Holocaust Memorial in Manhattan, promoting his efforts on behalf of Jewish voters and joining Jewish supporters in assailing his opponent, Representative Charles E. Schumer, over issues of concern to Israel and to Jews. Within two hours, Mr. Schumer, who is Jewish, had dispatched two of his own prominent Jewish supporters to the same strip of concrete, where they accused Mr. D'Amato of exploiting the Holocaust for political gain. The exchange stood in testimony to an unusual dynamic in this race.</p>

        <p>Murder Trial to Start  Opening statements are to begin today in the trial of Corey Arthur, a 20-year-old accused of killing his former English teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, for his banking card in May 1997. Mr. Levin, a popular and respected teacher in the Bronx, was the son of Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner.</p>

        <p>Former Tenant Abducted  A 26-year-old woman from Russia who was returning her keys to her former Brooklyn landlords on Saturday was abducted, taken to Staten Island and handcuffed to a bed before she managed to free herself, the police said. The former landlords were arrested. The kidnapping apparently grew out of a plot to extort money from the woman, who had given her passport as a security deposit, law-enforcement officials said.</p>

        <p>Jonathan B. Postel  A computer scientist who played a pivotal role in creating and administering the Internet, he was 55. Dr. Postel was a member of a small group of scientists who created the precursor to the Internet in the late 1960's, and for 30 years he handled the administrative end of the Internet address system.</p>

        <p>Adolf Althoff  A German circus executive who saved several people in the Nazi era by having them work and travel with his circus, he was 85. In a book about Germans who saved Jews from the Holocaust, Mr. Althoff is quoted as saying, ''Circus people don't ask if you are Christian, Jewish or heathen.'' His bravery earned him an honor from Israel and from a German organization.</p>

        <p>Dr. Samuel J. Messick  A leader in educational testing who argued for restraint in the use of student test scores, he was 67. Dr. Messick wrote 20 books and 175 scholarly articles, many arguing that testing should never be used to discriminate against children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who tend to score below more affluent counterparts on standardized tests.</p>

        <p>Microsoft Trial to Begin  The Government's trial against the Microsoft Corporation begins today, and it is a case more ambitious and complicated than the one prosecutors filed in May. That strategy carries a risk that some new evidence in the antitrust case will be thrown out, but also the possibility that any court-ordered remedies against Microsoft will be tougher.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>The Government's pursuit of Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started in 1989.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome of the trial, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines.</p>

        <p>A Question of Ethics  The saga of the investigative report on security at theme parks, including Walt Disney World -- and the decision by ABC News, which is owned by Disney, to shelve it -- illustrates the problems reporters have in examining their own companies.</p>
