        <p>The agency world is getting smaller again as another independent shop is being acquired.</p>
        <p>Envoy Communications Group in Toronto, which owns the Canadian agency Communique, is expanding to the United States by buying Hampel/Stefanides in New York. Financial terms of the deal, to be formally announced today, were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Hampel/Stefanides, founded in 1993, will continue to operate as an autonomous agency under that name. The present management team -- Larry Hampel, 39, president, and Dean Stefanides, 43, and Brian Goodall, 50, co-creative directors -- will continue in those roles.</p>
        <p>Hampel/Stefanides has had ''many opportunities to do a deal,'' Mr. Goodall said, but selected Envoy because it offered clients access to integrated marketing services like Web site design.</p>
        <p>Hampel/Stefanides, which also has an office in San Francisco, has 60 employees and billings estimated at $110 million from clients like Aer Lingus. Envoy agencies have 175 employees and billings estimated at $75 million (United States) from clients like Adidas.</p>
