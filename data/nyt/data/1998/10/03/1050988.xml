      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Great clouds of sound rose up off the stage on Sunday for Sam Rivers's big band show at Sweet Basil. Mr. Rivers, having convened some of the better players in New York, took advantage of their sound, the orchestral possibilities of all the personal textures, and had the musicians playing bright, intense and dissonant riffs. Solos didn't count so much; he let the musicians improvise in bits and pieces. What counted was the riff, the written passages that were dense with shifting contours and heavy with color.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivers, one of the most important figures to have arrived in the 1960's -- his Blue Note albums are masterpieces of balance -- has more or less disappeared from the jazz world. He occasionally surfaces with his rambunctious, funny trio, and his appearance at Sweet Basil with an orchestra was an event, drawing the bigger figures of the various jazz strains, from Anthony Braxton (whose own orchestral music at times sounds like Mr. Rivers's work) to the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.</p>

        <p>Great clouds of sound rose up off the stage on Sunday for Sam Rivers's big band show at Sweet Basil. Mr. Rivers, having convened some of the better players in New York, took advantage of their sound, the orchestral possibilities of all the personal textures, and had the musicians playing bright, intense and dissonant riffs. Solos didn't count so much; he let the musicians improvise in bits and pieces. What counted was the riff, the written passages that were dense with shifting contours and heavy with color.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivers, one of the most important figures to have arrived in the 1960's -- his Blue Note albums are masterpieces of balance -- has more or less disappeared from the jazz world. He occasionally surfaces with his rambunctious, funny trio, and his appearance at Sweet Basil with an orchestra was an event, drawing the bigger figures of the various jazz strains, from Anthony Braxton (whose own orchestral music at times sounds like Mr. Rivers's work) to the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.</p>
        <p>And they heard something special. Mr. Rivers worked with just a bit of harmony in the bass, a pedal tone, a riff or a short cycle of chords. On that, he poured the harmony, using his horns. He mostly avoided strong melodies, instead using riffs and line piled on top of line, chord piled on top of chord, until the whole edifice glimmered with sound. On ''Beatrice,'' his best-known composition, his method became clear; the melody, at first, hardly existed, flashing once in a while under the sand dunes of dissonance.</p>
        <p>Then it appeared; Mr. Rivers improvised for a bit, and a string of riffs and written passages took the piece further from the idea of a song. After singing a bit and talking a bit, he  started playing his tune ''Rejuvenation'' with a funk bass line and rhythms. The music, large and heavy but never ponderous, took off again.</p>
