        <p>After a boisterous public hearing, the committee that supervises the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village voted last night to recommend that the annual extravaganza continue, with a few changes to make it less riotous.</p>
        <p>The recommendations include deploying more police in the subways, strictly enforcing laws against public drinking, and having merchants pay for more portable toilets.</p>

        <p>After a boisterous public hearing, the committee that supervises the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village voted last night to recommend that the annual extravaganza continue, with a few changes to make it less riotous.</p>
        <p>The recommendations include deploying more police in the subways, strictly enforcing laws against public drinking, and having merchants pay for more portable toilets.</p>
        <p>Lora Tenenbaum, a member of the Street Activities Committee of Community Board 2, said, ''This is a parade that creates great stress in the community, and we need solutions to that stress.''</p>
        <p>Opponents want the Giuliani administration to deny it a parade permit on the grounds that the large numbers -- more than a million spectators and 20,000 marchers -- have transformed a once bawdy neighborhood event into something much too beastly and Bacchanalian as it wends up Sixth Avenue from Spring Street to 23d Street.</p>
        <p>The city has not issued a permit yet, but is expected to follow the recommendation of the community board.</p>
        <p>Up to 250 supporters and opponents of the parade packed the hearing last night. Any applause that greeted opponents was easily drowned out by hissing, and one elderly woman in the balcony bellowed ''Monstrous'' at any sign of support for the parade, which marks its 25th anniversary this year.</p>
        <p>Andrea Pisner, who lives along the parade route near West 12th Street, said she felt in danger in her own neighborhood because of the crowds.  ''You either stay away until midnight or stay upstairs just because of the size of the crowd,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Supporters painted those who would do away with the parade as killjoys who go to bed at 9 P.M. no matter what the night.</p>
        <p>''It's a party night,'' said Isaac Zakouto, 51, a waiter who has worked in Greenwich Village for 20 years and lived there for 5. ''Whoever doesn't like it should stay home, rent two movies and watch them,'' he said. He waved off complaints about public vomiting, drinking and urinating. ''It's good for the flowers.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the parade, including the Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce, believe it attracts  business and helps the area maintain its image.</p>
        <p>Opponents have raised concerns that the parade serves as a vehicle for gay bashing, although police records show no bias crimes were reported at the last two parades. Some opponents are apprehensive because there have been three murders in the Village recently, two of which involved homosexuals, and because anti-gay bias crimes have jumped 81 percent citywide this year.</p>
        <p>City Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who represents Greenwich Village, asked the Guiliani administration last month to refuse the parade a permit or move it to another neighborhood. He said some good suggestions were raised at the meeting to lessen the problems, including holding the parade during the day (Halloween is a Saturday this year) or extending the parade route.</p>
        <p>The recommendation from the Street Activities Committee will be passed on to the 16-member Executive Committee tomorrow for its vote. Arthur Strickler, the district manager for Community Board 2, said the Executive Committee is voting now because the next full board meeting is scheduled for only a week before Halloween. He said it was rare for the Executive Committee to overturn a recommendation made after a public hearing.</p>
