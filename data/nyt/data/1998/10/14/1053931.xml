        <p>No wonder GOLDIE HAWN put on her sunglasses. Long before President Clinton arrived at the G &amp; P Charitable Foundation's party honoring MILTON BERLE on his 90th birthday, the photographers were busy. First they took pictures of Ms. Hawn alone.</p>

        <p>Uncle Miltie Is 90</p>
        <p>No wonder GOLDIE HAWN put on her sunglasses. Long before President Clinton arrived at the G &amp; P Charitable Foundation's party honoring MILTON BERLE on his 90th birthday, the photographers were busy. First they took pictures of Ms. Hawn alone.</p>
        <p>Then she was introduced to SARAH FERGUSON, the Duchess of York, and there was another round of snap-snap, flash-flash. ''I'm so pictured out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then she went to Mr. Berle's table, and bowed. He stood up and kissed her. More snap-snap, flash-flash.</p>
        <p>One can only imagine what it would have been like if her longtime companion, KURT RUSSELL, had been there. ''He flew to Washington to see Boston,'' Ms. Hawn said. It sounded like a punchline from her days on ''Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,'' but no. Mr. Russell has an 18-year-old son, Boston, who is a student at Georgetown University. In Washington.</p>
        <p>Then, when Mr. Berle left the cocktail party for the ballroom where the dinner was about to begin, it was his turn for some snap-snap, flash-flash with his wife, LORNA. ''She keeps telling me how happy I am,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And then there was KATIE COURIC, an anchor on the ''Today'' show, dressed in Armani. Maybe it was just that she had stayed up past her bedtime, but when she went over to greet reporters who had been corralled behind a rope, she said: ''Can you believe it? I've never had a really nice dress before.''</p>
        <p>Then a man from the Philippines introduced himself, saying that he watched her every morning. He asked if he could shake her hand. She agreed. Then he asked if he could kiss her hand.</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' she said. ''Why not?'' So he did.</p>
        <p>Unflattering Suit</p>
        <p>This is probably not something they will talk about in the unisex bathroom on ''Ally McBeal'':</p>
        <p>CALISTA FLOCKHART, the star with the thigh-climbing skirts and the dancing-baby hallucinations, is being sued by a real-life Manhattan law firm, which says she owes the firm 5 percent of everything she earns from the prime-time series.</p>
        <p>The law firm -- Frankfurt, Garbus, Klein and Seltz -- which says it reviewed the contract she signed when she got the part, maintains that the fine print in that document promises the firm 5 percent of her ''Ally McBeal'' earnings, which total $780,000 as of last week. Frankfurt, Garbus is accusing her of breach of contract for failing to pay $39,000.</p>
        <p>In court papers filed in State Supreme Court, the firm laid out the financial arrangements it says Ms. Flockhart agreed to. The firm says the contract called for her to take home $50,000 for the pilot episode and $30,000 an episode once the series went on the air.</p>
        <p>''We've made absolutely every effort to resolve this,'' said MAURA WOGAN, who filed the lawsuit for the firm. But a spokesman for Ms. Flockhart said, ''She doesn't owe them any money.''</p>
        <p>Dividing Her Time</p>
        <p>So how does ISABEL ALLENDE find time to write? Yesterday she was in New York, doing the things authors do: being interviewed in the morning and appearing at a ceremony in the evening. She left the ceremony, at the Hudson Theater on West 44th Street, with the $200,000 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. But back to the question of time to write.</p>
        <p>''I have a very schizophrenic life,'' Ms. Allende said. ''One part is about being out there, and one part is private, quiet. Fortunately, I don't have to take care of my kids anymore. They're grown and gone.''</p>
        <p>She told an interviewer that the ceremony was the first time her parents, her son and a Chilean friend had been in the same place at the same time in 25 years. She also said that she had just finished another novel, about the California gold rush. ''My mother is the only person who corrects my manuscripts,'' Ms. Allende said. ''She said, 'I'm so pleased that for the first time we're not in the book.' ''</p>
