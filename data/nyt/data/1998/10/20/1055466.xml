        <p>When the New York-born soprano Aprile Millo made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1984 as Amelia in Verdi's ''Simon Boccanegra,'' there was talk among critics and opera buffs that the next important Verdi soprano had arrived. She seemed to be a true spinto soprano, combining lyric and dramatic vocal qualities, a singer in the tradition of Zinka Milanov and Leontyne Price.</p>
        <p>By the end of the 80's, Ms. Millo began experiencing some vocal difficulties that persisted in the next few years. More recently, she has been regaining her vocal confidence. And on Thursday night she was back in the touchstone role of Puccini's Tosca.</p>

        <p>When the New York-born soprano Aprile Millo made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1984 as Amelia in Verdi's ''Simon Boccanegra,'' there was talk among critics and opera buffs that the next important Verdi soprano had arrived. She seemed to be a true spinto soprano, combining lyric and dramatic vocal qualities, a singer in the tradition of Zinka Milanov and Leontyne Price.</p>
        <p>By the end of the 80's, Ms. Millo began experiencing some vocal difficulties that persisted in the next few years. More recently, she has been regaining her vocal confidence. And on Thursday night she was back in the touchstone role of Puccini's Tosca.</p>
        <p>There was much to admire in Ms. Millo's performance. Her voice now has a bit of wobble, and her tone can sometimes turn strident. But hers is still a rich, vibrant sound that carries well without force. And her arching vocal lines were often elegant. But the coordination with the conductor, Nello Santi, was way off. Either she was prolonging phrases indulgently or he was nudging her to move more quickly. It was bothersome, whatever the case.</p>
        <p>Dramatically, Ms. Millo was less successful. She moves  stolidly onstage, and her acting and even at times her singing lacked passion, incisiveness and temperament. When she flung her cloak at Scarpia's henchman in the final scene before leaping off the castle wall, you would have thought she was asking him to hold it for her while she got something from upstairs.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Millo has the presence of a prima donna, and many loyal fans rewarded her with bravos and bouquets. The rest of the cast was unchanged, including Richard Leech as Cavaradossi and Alain Fondary as Scarpia.</p>
