        <p>Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday that plans to help shore up Social Security by seeking higher returns in the financial markets risked leaving inexperienced investors vulnerable to fraud.</p>
        <p>Wading into what is likely to be one of the most intensely debated issues of the coming year, Mr. Levitt emphasized that he was not endorsing any of the proposals for revising Social Security in advance of the boomer generation's retirement.

        <p>Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday that plans to help shore up Social Security by seeking higher returns in the financial markets risked leaving inexperienced investors vulnerable to fraud.</p>
        <p>Wading into what is likely to be one of the most intensely debated issues of the coming year, Mr. Levitt emphasized that he was not endorsing any of the proposals for revising Social Security in advance of the boomer generation's retirement. But he noted that nearly all of the plans involve allowing individuals to invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds or permitting the Federal Government itself more latitude to invest the retirement system's trust funds, which are now held in special Treasury bonds.</p>
        <p>Both approaches hold considerable implications for oversight of the markets, and Mr. Levitt said that the S.E.C. intended to play a role as Congress and the Clinton Administration work on a plan. President Clinton has said that he plans to hold a White House conference on Social Security in December and that he would like to send a proposal to Congress early next year.</p>
        <p>That debate will play out against a background of extraordinary volatility and uncertainty in the global financial system and the markets. The effects of the market's gyrations on public acceptance of any option for Social Security are not yet clear, and Mr. Levitt noted the development only in passing.</p>
        <p>Instead, he focused on broader long-range issues. Giving 140 million working Americans the right and responsibility to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes on their own would require increased vigilance against fraud, he said. It would also require vastly increased education for investors about how the markets operate and about the risks and costs of investing, he said.</p>
        <p>And permitting the Government to invest the trust funds, he said, would require careful consideration of Washington's role as a shareholder and the potential for political interference in corporate governance, investment selection and the operation of the markets.</p>
        <p>''We have an obligation to think long and hard about the implications of Social Security reform,'' Mr. Levitt said in the prepared text of a speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. ''Investing Social Security in the stock market, by its very nature, involves heightened obligations, difficult questions and new challenges.''</p>
        <p>Concerned that opponents of such accounts will raise the possible greed of brokers and fund managers as an issue, Wall Street has stayed mostly on the sidelines as the nation begins to discuss what changes to make to Social Security, which is projected to run short of money to pay retirement benefits in 2032.</p>
        <p>Moving toward individual accounts, however, could create a huge new business for financial-services firms and set off intense competition for the right to help manage the retirement finances of nearly every working person.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Levitt said, any move to give individuals a broad choice of options in how to invest their Social Security contributions would require regulators to step up efforts at investor protection.</p>
        <p>''If we are to have self-directed individual accounts, we must be ready to undertake an unprecedented level of broad-scale policing of the equity markets,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''Without such policies, fraud and sales-practice abuses may be perpetrated against an army of novice investors. And many of those novice investors are our society's most vulnerable citizens.''</p>
        <p>He recalled the experience in Britain, where the Government gave individuals considerable freedom a decade ago to choose how to handle their pensions. Some workers were besieged with sales pitches for annuities and other products that proved riskier than advertised, and when those investments went wrong they caused billions of dollars in losses.</p>
        <p>Should the United States move toward individual accounts, Mr. Levitt said, he would be concerned about people being confronted with advertising infused with ''performance hype'' that could create unrealistic expectations about returns.</p>
        <p>''We simply cannot afford to instill in millions of new investors a culture of seeking short-term gain at the expense of long-term solid results,'' he said. ''That is not what Social Security is about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitt said that more than half of Americans do not know the difference between a stock and a bond, and that only 16 percent say they have a clear understanding of what an individual retirement account is.</p>
        <p>Privatizing Social Security would  require better investor education as individuals confront topics like management fees and annuities, under which a lump sum is traded for guaranteed monthly payments for life.</p>
        <p>''There is an unacceptably wide gap between financial knowledge and financial responsibilities,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''Closing this knowledge gap is among the most important problems we face today. It becomes even more of an imperative if Social Security is privatized.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitt also said that the idea of the Federal Government owning stock in publicly traded companies is rife with potential conflicts.</p>
        <p>''Could the Government invest in a tobacco company?'' he asked. ''What about a company that was a toxic polluter a decade ago? More broadly, assuming the Government invests in individual equities as opposed to market indexes, would it be able to vote its shares? If so, how?''</p>
