        <p>Peter Watrous reviews concert by jazz drummer Lewis Nash at Village Vanguard (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Who exactly Lewis Nash is as a drummer has always been in question. Mr. Nash, perhaps the drummer most in demand in jazz circles in New York, plays with all sorts of people, from the pianist Tommy Flanagan to jazz orchestras. He has been consistently excellent and selfless as a sideman, and what he wanted from music was never apparent. But after last week's stay at the Village Vanguard, he has cleared up his allegiances; he's after adventurous music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nash, leading a band that included a front line with Steve Nelson on vibraphone, Jimmy Green on saxophones and Regina Carter, was making music that used all sorts of textures and that ignored the jazz malaise that comes from too much allegiance to convention. He was thinking like a band leader, although not all his tunes used the full band, and he even set up a tune as a feature for Ms. Carter.</p>

        <p>Who exactly Lewis Nash is as a drummer has always been in question. Mr. Nash, perhaps the drummer most in demand in jazz circles in New York, plays with all sorts of people, from the pianist Tommy Flanagan to jazz orchestras. He has been consistently excellent and selfless as a sideman, and what he wanted from music was never apparent. But after last week's stay at the Village Vanguard, he has cleared up his allegiances; he's after adventurous music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nash, leading a band that included a front line with Steve Nelson on vibraphone, Jimmy Green on saxophones and Regina Carter, was making music that used all sorts of textures and that ignored the jazz malaise that comes from too much allegiance to convention. He was thinking like a band leader, although not all his tunes used the full band, and he even set up a tune as a feature for Ms. Carter.</p>
        <p>Halfway through the first set on Wednesday, Mr. Nash performed a duet with the bassist Peter Washington, using Dizzy Gillespie's ''Two Bass Hit'' as the basis for the improvisation. He started the piece by playing the melody on the drums, rapping out the rhythms with the articulation of a bullet smacking metal. Mr. Washington joined in, walking through the chord changes; Mr. Nash surrounded his bass lines with tumult. Then Mr. Washington stopped playing, and Mr. Nash kept going, fooling with the rhythms of the tune, finally reaching the melody. The tune broke up the set.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nash also performed an Afro-Cuban version of ''Nature Boy'' and a Motown tune. Through it all he kept an endless set of variations going, moving from drum to drum, keeping the time obvious on the ride cymbal, for example, but letting his left hand roam over his kit. The snare, various rims of his drums and the floor tom gave him texture. He used that texture as if, behind the soloist, another monologue were running at the same time. It gave the music layers, and made it complicated.</p>
