        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato continued his campaign to win the hearts and votes of upstate New Yorkers today, visiting a string of storm-ravaged farms from Syracuse to Lake Erie and pledging to play the role of the ''pothole Senator'' by winning Federal disaster aid for the region.</p>
        <p>In his second swing across northern New York State in two weeks, Mr. D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term, munched apples, inspected wind-shorn trees and hail-pitted apples, wore an oversize ''Apple Country'' cap and touted his Senate votes to help farmers on issues like maintaining dairy price supports.</p>

        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato continued his campaign to win the hearts and votes of upstate New Yorkers today, visiting a string of storm-ravaged farms from Syracuse to Lake Erie and pledging to play the role of the ''pothole Senator'' by winning Federal disaster aid for the region.</p>
        <p>In his second swing across northern New York State in two weeks, Mr. D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term, munched apples, inspected wind-shorn trees and hail-pitted apples, wore an oversize ''Apple Country'' cap and touted his Senate votes to help farmers on issues like maintaining dairy price supports.</p>
        <p>At fruit farms near Syracuse, Rochester and Niagara Falls, Mr. D'Amato said he would try to add money to an agriculture appropriations bill, which is expected to reach the Senate next week, to help farmers hurt by a series of freak hail and wind storms that swept through western and central New York this summer. Farm groups have estimated that the storms caused $40 million in damage, mainly to fruit growers.</p>
        <p>''This is a battle for our people, for the little guy,'' Mr. D'Amato said at a stop at G and S Orchards in rural Macedon, 17 miles southeast of Rochester. ''You know, they call me the pothole Senator. They do. They make fun. But let me tell you, the potholes are real people.''</p>
        <p>But as much as he sought to use the one-day trip to burnish his record on agriculture in a solidly Republican region, Mr. D'Amato also tried to take some swipes at his Democratic challenger, Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, by complaining about people who think that ''upstate New York is Westchester.''</p>
        <p>''I've never pitted the interest of one region against the other or denied support from one to help the other or looked at one with indifference or disdain,'' Mr. D'Amato told reporters following the event.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. D'Amato, who comes from Long Island, claimed that he was not referring to Mr. Schumer in making those remarks, his recent stump speeches and commercials have hammered at Mr. Schumer as a ''New York City liberal'' who is oblivious to the needs of upstate residents and believes that ''the West begins across the Hudson River.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, who was observing the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>In focusing again on northern New York today, Mr. D'Amato and his advisers provided further evidence that they believe his fortunes in a tight race will hinge on driving up voter turnout in Republican-rich communities like Macedon, as well as on denting the reputation of Mr. Schumer, who despite his own free-spending campaign still seems to be an enigma to most voters here.</p>
        <p>Some local politicians said today that there may be good reason for Mr. D'Amato to be concerned about upstate turnout in November because voter discontent is running relatively low and because the race for governor, typically a voter draw, is not attracting much attention.</p>
        <p>''I think he knows he's going to have a real tough time downstate and feels in a close election that upstate can win it for him,'' said Frank J. Guelli, a Democratic Supervisor in Walworth, who is supporting Mr. D'Amato. ''Unfortunately, there's not much of a governor's race and that could affect turnout.''</p>
        <p>But there were also hints today that Mr. D'Amato's attacks on Mr. Schumer may be wearing thin among some upstate residents. During Mr. D'Amato's Macedon appearance, local reporters peppered the Senator with sharp questions about the negative tone of the campaign and the potentially divisive nature of his upstate strategy.</p>
        <p>Placed on the defensive at one point by a series of questions, Mr. D'Amato testily challenged one television reporter to take a critical look at Mr. Schumer, who has accused Mr. D'Amato of lying and of being ''sleazy.''</p>
        <p>''I have not engaged in any personal attacks,'' Mr. D'Amato said. ''But you won't run any of this. You'll slice it and dice it the way you want it.''</p>
        <p>But some of the farmers who came out to meet Mr. D'Amato at G and S Orchards said they thought his strategy was just right. ''There's a mentality around here, and I have it as well, that New York City ought to form its own country,'' said Brandon Furber, 36, a third-generation farmer in Huron.</p>
