        <p>Glenn Foley felt good, declaring himself fully healed from his torn rib cartilage that forced him to sit out the Jets' last game. The pain that he felt today came from the stinging words of his coach as a difference of opinion developed on Foley's fitness to play against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Parcells said that Foley had not shown enough in Tuesday's practice to end discussion on whether Foley or Vinny Testaverde would start at quarterback. But Foley insisted that he was 100 percent healthy, although he confessed that after a three-day layoff the offense was rusty in Tuesday's workout.</p>

        <p>Glenn Foley felt good, declaring himself fully healed from his torn rib cartilage that forced him to sit out the Jets' last game. The pain that he felt today came from the stinging words of his coach as a difference of opinion developed on Foley's fitness to play against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Parcells said that Foley had not shown enough in Tuesday's practice to end discussion on whether Foley or Vinny Testaverde would start at quarterback. But Foley insisted that he was 100 percent healthy, although he confessed that after a three-day layoff the offense was rusty in Tuesday's workout.</p>
        <p>''I feel great,'' Foley told reporters. ''But according to what you guys are saying, I guess I have to show him. From my standpoint, I approach it the same way. The pressure is always going to be there to get the team rolling in practice. You've got to make sure you're sharp. If you're not, he's not going to play you.''</p>
        <p>Parcells said that he would split the snaps evenly again between Foley and Testaverde in today's workout. The coach would not disclose which way he was leaning, but he did say that Foley was not perfect and that Foley had to show him more.</p>
        <p>''I've been watching this kid for two years,'' Parcells said. ''I know when he looks normal and when he doesn't. If he looks normal, he's going to start. If he doesn't look normal, he's not. There's not grades of this at this spot. If you do that at this position, it can cause you to lose.''</p>
        <p>A decision to start Testaverde might not shock Foley, but it would hurt more than the ribs.</p>
        <p>''It would be very disappointing,'' Foley said. ''I want to play. I've worked all season to try to get to this position. But again, I've also been here and I've also been in the other shoe.</p>
        <p>''If he doesn't play me this week, we wait until next week to see who he's going to play,'' Foley said, referring to Parcells. ''Either way, it doesn't surprise me. We've been through this before. He's taken quarterbacks out on the Friday before games and done it that way. Anything he does is the way it's going to be, and you've just got to go out and execute accordingly. It's a little leverage in terms of motivation. But you've got to play, you've got to practice hard, and if you're not playing well, no matter what the circumstances are, he's going to play the other guy. If I don't go out there and practice well today, he can play Vinny this weekend. That's the way it always is, that's the way it's always been, and he won't change.''</p>
