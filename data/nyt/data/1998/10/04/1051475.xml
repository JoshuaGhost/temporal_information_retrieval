        <p>WHAT a difference two months can make.</p>
        <p>As recently as this summer, the debate between market timers and buy-and-hold investors was all but dead: Buy-and-hold investors had declared victory, and few were disagreeing. After all, this year was shaping up as yet another in which virtually no market timers -- investors who try to jump in and out of stocks at the most opportune moments -- were doing better than the overall market.</p>
        <p>But with the broad market down 20 percent from its midsummer highs, the faith of buy-and-hold investors is being tested.</p>
        <p>How should you decide whether to try timing the market? Begin by acquainting yourself with the compelling statistical case against it: Fewer than 20 percent of market timers are able to beat a buy-and-hold strategy on a risk-adjusted basis. And when taxes are taken into account, it's even more difficult for market timers to come out ahead because of capital gains.</p>
        <p>Buy-and-holders, however, mistakenly consider the matter to be solely about statistics. Investors don't give up on a buy-and-hold strategy because they are ignorant of the data; they do so because they can't take the psychological pain of an extended market decline.</p>
        <p>The lesson, of course, is that you shouldn't wait until the bottom of the next bear market to discover that you're a closet market timer. After all, investors who try to execute a buy-and-hold strategy but lose nerve at the bottom of the next bear market will likely be worse off than investors who pursue a thoughtful market-timing strategy that looks inferior on statistical grounds.</p>
        <p>Latter-day converts to the buy-and-hold strategy assure me that they won't be foolish and throw in the towel in a bear market. But I don't believe them. The only investors who could persuade me otherwise are those who were fully invested in late 1974, at the bottom of the last severe bear market. And there are precious few of them. All the other buy-and-holders either aren't telling the truth or are too young to have anything more than hope about how they will behave in the next bear market.</p>
        <p>How do investors behave at market troughs? In the 1973-74 bear market, Martin Zweig, a market forecaster, counted the percentage of newsletter ads in Barron's that were bullish -- a sensitive barometer of the public mood, because newsletter publishers know which way the wind is blowing.  In the last six months of that market, he said, there were a number of weeks in which not one ad was bullish.</p>
        <p>WHY is it so psychologically difficult to stay fully invested, when it's clear statistically that most investors would be better off in the long run if they did? The long run is much longer than the typical investor's attention span.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself this: How long do you think you must hold your stocks to be assured that you'll at least stay even with riskless Treasury bills? Five years? Not good enough.</p>
        <p>According to Prof. Jeremy Siegel at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, stocks failed to keep pace with T-bills in 25 percent of the rolling five-year periods since 1802. The situation is barely better when investors hold for 10 years; 20 percent of those periods failed to keep up with T-bills. In fact, to get the failure rate down to just 5 percent -- a benchmark for an acceptable bet -- investors must be willing to hold stocks for more than 20 years. No wonder so few investors have sufficient staying power to buy and hold.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the psychological strain of buying and holding shouldn't seduce you into thinking that following just any market timing system will do better: Not all market timers are created equal.</p>
        <p>But there are a select few market-timing newsletters -- just five among all those that I have tracked over the last 15 years -- that have shown that they can at least immunize investors, relatively speaking, from more risk than the performance they forfeit in the process. The Elliott Wave Theorist, for example, has had an annualized return of 12 percent since 1982 -- 3.6 percentage points shy of the Wilshire 5000, but at just about half the risk.</p>
        <p>Since 1982, however, only one newsletter beat the market's overall return through Aug. 31 -- Systems and Forecasts, published by Gerald Appel in Great Neck, N.Y.</p>
