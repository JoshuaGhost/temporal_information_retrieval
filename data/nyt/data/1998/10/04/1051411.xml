        <p>IT'S my first day in divorce court, and I'm waiting anxiously in the hall for my lawyer -- worried about how my life will change, whether my two children and I will have to move out of the city. And I can't believe what I am wearing.</p>
        <p>In a headband, pleated skirt and flat loafers, I look like a parochial schoolgirl -- never mind that I'm a TriBeCa mom in my 40's, given to dressing in spandex and jeans.

        <p>IT'S my first day in divorce court, and I'm waiting anxiously in the hall for my lawyer -- worried about how my life will change, whether my two children and I will have to move out of the city. And I can't believe what I am wearing.</p>
        <p>In a headband, pleated skirt and flat loafers, I look like a parochial schoolgirl -- never mind that I'm a TriBeCa mom in my 40's, given to dressing in spandex and jeans. I look like an impostor. But then, so do all the other women on the docket waiting in the hall, which is the last stop on the train of marital disillusion. For this lugubrious occasion, we've all been dressed by our lawyers. They're not interested in our personal style -- they just want us to win.</p>
        <p>It means looking conservative, understated and traditional, muted, respectful and unadorned. There is freshly snipped hair, minimal jewelry and no watches with bracelet bands -- only cloth bands are acceptable. The motto of divorce lawyers everywhere seems to be: nothing that glitters or glistens. I adjust my headband and console myself with the thought that it's retro chic.</p>
        <p>Lawyerly wisdom has long held that you dress for court as you dress for church: pearls and pumps for women, a dark suit and a white shirt for men.</p>
        <p>But in divorce cases, strategies of appearance are more complex. Although everyone agrees that a plaintiff should look restrained and respectful to win a judge's favor, every divorce lawyer turns out to be a stylist, with a different opinion of how to achieve a winning look.</p>
        <p>In the year and a half it's taken for my case to come to trial, I've had three lawyers, and each has had a different say on how I should dress for this day. Eleanor Grosz, the first one, sounded as affirming as a Liz Claiborne separates advertisement: ''Be comfortable.''</p>
        <p>But then she gave me her list of don'ts: no miniskirts, no tight tops, no designer logos, no pants, no sandals, no fish-net stockings, no red nails, no glamorous hair and, for goodness' sake, no spandex. (I was wearing a tube skirt at the time.)</p>
        <p>I moved on to lawyer No. 2, Frank Bonem, who pictured me in court as June Cleaver -- if Ward had been an alcoholic with a quick fuse. ''You want to look like a woman who is most comfortable in the kitchen or doing homework with the kids,'' he said. ''You want to look matronly.'' He intended to portray me as a victim, so I had to appear in need of sympathy. That meant no suit -- a suit suggests an office, not a 50's kitchen -- and he proposed a conservative dress, the darker the better.</p>
        <p>My current lawyer, Bernard Clair, has an altogether different vision. He thinks I should look like a working mother, which is what I am, having returned to an editing career recently after 10 years as a stay-at-home mom. His advice is to look as if I've gotten myself back in the saddle and just need a little boost from the court in the form of a generous settlement. To convey this image, I am not to wear my own stylish clothes but, in Mr. Clair's surprisingly precise words, ''a dress or skirt, knee-long, no slits, no pants, no hand jewelry, maybe a scarf for a touch of femininity, nothing too bright, don't show your toes.'' Oh, and nothing white, either. It's too aggressive. Do I have a pale blue blouse?</p>
        <p>Justice may be blind, but judges are not, and lawyers describe divorce as putting on a play. The costumes are critical.</p>
        <p>''Appearance is everything,'' said Bradley A. Pistotnik, a lawyer in Wichita, Kan., and the author of ''Divorce War!'' He is one of a growing breed of experts who advise lawyers and clients on their appearances. ''A judge cannot help but be swayed by how you look, and different colors, styles, fabrics convey different messages,'' he said. ''This may seem to go against the principles of justice or seem sexist, but it is an inevitable reality.''</p>
        <p>The growing number of judges who are women and can tell the difference between Armani and what's available from the mall has complicated the courtroom dress-for-success formula, lawyers say. Eleanor Alter, who represented Mia Farrow and other women in celebrity cases, recalled a case in which a client who was seeking emergency additional child support dressed head to toe in Yves Saint Laurent. ''The judge, a woman, ran her eyes down her, adding up what everything cost, and said, 'I don't think so,' '' Ms. Alter said.</p>
        <p>In high-profile, high-stakes cases, the rules change. Here a woman can deck herself out. Robert Stephan Cohen, a Manhattan divorce lawyer who has represented many well-heeled clients, said: ''I tell them to wear Chanel. If your husband is worth $25 million, you have to show that your life style is money.''</p>
        <p>Raoul Felder, another celebrity divorce lawyer, eschews Chanel in favor of more understated expensive clothes. ''Those Belgian loafers that look like nothing but cost about $400 a pair, or cashmere -- one of those little sweater-over-sweater sets,'' Mr. Felder said. ''I always ask, 'Does this say life style, or does this say I've overspent?' ''</p>
        <p>Like many lawyers, Mr. Felder does a jewelry check just before court convenes. Marie Vaccarelli, a Boston divorce lawyer, explained that even if the goal is to suggest that the woman has grown accustomed to luxury, certain over-the-top jewelry can alienate the court. ''No Cartiers, Rolexes, gold chains, pinkie rings,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Men, too, tackle the wardrobe issue with cunning. Kenneth Burrows, a divorce lawyer, has sent male clients to the Salvation Army to buy threadbare suits. ''The guy may not be very affluent, but he's too proud to let it show,'' he said. ''I help him be who he is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Felder forbids male clients to slick back their hair, manicure beards or sport handkerchiefs in breast pockets. He goes for Clark Kent appeal. ''I always ask if they wear glasses,'' he said, adding that glasses always look good. After one trial in which Mr. Felder made a client wear a cheap suit to court every day, the client celebrated by burning it up in Mr. Felder's office fireplace.</p>
        <p>In celebrity cases, flourishes are allowed. Mr. Felder, who is representing Carol Channing in a divorce from Charles Lowe, her husband of 42 years, persuaded her to shed her signature blond wig and unveil the gray underneath -- a ploy meant to suggest that beneath the shimmery exterior, there has been suffering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clair, who is representing Jocelyne Wildenstein in her bid for a share of the fortune the Wildenstein family made buying and selling art, said he might visit the Chanel boutique on East 57th Street to buy the same clothes and baubles that her estranged husband, Alec Wildenstein, is supposed to have bought for a Russian girlfriend. Then Mrs. Wildenstein would wear the outfit to court ''just to unnerve him,'' Mr. Clair said.</p>
        <p>But while the celebrities posture and preen, the rest of us do our best to blend. After all the advice, what was I to wear on my day in court? Part of me wanted to look like a competent mother, part felt like a victim, and in my heart of hearts, I wanted to sweep in in a form-fitting Richard Tyler suit, not so much to impress my ex, but to appear tall, thin and untouchable in a way that a power suit conveys.</p>
        <p>In the end, I borrowed some advice from everyone. In the back of my closet, I found an eight-year-old skirt, below the knee: good. But it was black: bad, because black is a power color. But it had pleats: good, because pleats are conservative. I chose five-year-old black flats -- not ballet slippers, just old Joan &amp; David loafers. The one thing I bought was a pale blue blouse at J. Crew. It was just right, with a little cardigan buttoned to the collar. The headband, black velvet, was borrowed from my sitter.</p>
        <p>I wasn't thrilled about looking so colorless in front of my former lover on our marital D-day. But when Mr. Clair surveyed me before the court session, he said I'd do. And he assured me that I would have my day to dress as I pleased in court. ''The day the judge is signing off -- after the case is settled and the agreement has been signed, sealed and delivered -- that's the day to look fabulous,'' he said. ''Wear your best dress, all your jewelry. It's your last goodbye to your husband, and you want him to think, 'What did I let go?' ''</p>
