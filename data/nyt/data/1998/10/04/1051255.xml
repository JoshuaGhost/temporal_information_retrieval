        <p>THOUSANDS of people are visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new exhibition of works by Louis Comfort Tiffany, which is filled with the artist's striking leaded glass, lamps, vases and other decorative pieces. At the same time, thousands are walking unaware past a three-building complex that was once the headquarters of the artist's decorating firm, at 25th Street and Park Avenue South, where a few traces of 19th-century glass, woodwork and trim survive, testament to one of the most fertile minds in American design.</p>
        <p>Charles Lewis Tiffany established his silver and jewelry firm in 1837 and a quarter-century later had become so successful that his son, Louis Comfort Tiffany, did not need to work for a living. Louis studied painting in Europe in the 1860's, but became convinced that he could reach people more effectively as a decorative artist.</p>
        <p>In 1881 he moved his growing decorating company to a pair of buildings at the southeast corner of 25th Street and Park Avenue South -- then Fourth Avenue -- taking over an unusual High Victorian Gothic studio building designed in 1875 by J. C. Markham. The firm remained at the location through 1905, building and designing a third structure, a six-story factory-studio building at 102 East 25th Street, in 1891.</p>
        <p>IT was from this complex that Tiffany designed the lavish interiors of the Havemeyer house, once at 66th Street and Fifth Avenue, the stained glass of St. Michael's Church, at 99th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and parts of the lobby of the Osborne apartment building at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>An 1896 building inspection described the building in the middle of the avenue as a store on the first floor, offices on the second, a workshop and drafting room on the third, ''leading glazing workshop'' on the fourth and metal workshop on the fifth.</p>
        <p>An account in The New York Times of 1894 described a public exhibition of an entire chapel: gold-embroidered vestments for priests, monumental glass windows, interior fountains, enormous lanterns for cathedrals.</p>
        <p>In 1894 Tiffany introduced his striking favrile technique, the multicolored, almost molten-looking glass that became, after leaded-glass lamps, his signature work.</p>
        <p>In 1897 Cecelia Waern, writing in International Studio magazine, reported 40 to 50 young women artisans at work in the building and described the mild disarray of the artist's inner sanctum on the fifth floor:  ''Here choice pieces of blown glass lie around, awaiting attention from Mr. Tiffany.''</p>
        <p>The writer said that the back stairs were littered with half-completed projects. On view were stained glass, mosaic tile and other artworks destined for the Chicago Public Library, Princeton University and unspecified projects in Columbia, Miss., and Kansas City, Mo.</p>
        <p>Tiffany moved his company to 44th Street and Madison Avenue in 1905 while his business was beginning to peak; by the 1920's his rich colors and dense designs were definitely out of fashion. In 1932 Tiffany Studios went bankrupt, and Tiffany died the next year. J. Alastair Duncan, the decorative arts historian and Tiffany authority, said that the commercial success of the firm was limited and that Louis Comfort Tiffany himself made up the almost constant deficits in the firm's operations.</p>
        <p>Tiffany designs plummeted in esteem in the 1950's, but began a magnificent comeback in the 1960's. This summer the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened ''Louis Comfort Tiffany at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' a collection of Tiffany furniture, jewelry, stained glass and favrile glass curated by Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen.</p>
        <p>ALONG with the artwork itself the show includes a battered worker's bench from the studio, with tools and a wooden form demonstrating how the stained-glass lampshades were made.</p>
        <p>The old Tiffany studio complex, at 25th and Park Avenue South, was converted to a commercial co-op in 1980 and was covered in red paint years ago.</p>
        <p>It now has artists, photographers and others who have heard in vague terms about the building's past. A tour through the inside of the three joined structures is a journey of discovery through a maze of interlocking halls and stairways.</p>
        <p>The corner building, built in 1875, has a giant central stair and atrium, with the characteristic chunky Victorian Gothic detailing -- dating from before Tiffany's occupancy, but an important survivor nonetheless, exceptional for its size, age and integrity.</p>
        <p>Another stairway, circular, winds around a curious 14-inch-wide baluster, strikingly plain, which because of its age and styling must be from the Tiffany occupancy. A third set of stairs on the 25th Street side -- in the 1891 building that Tiffany built -- is severe enough to be consonant with an industrial building, but so elegant they were clearly designed with care.</p>
        <p>There are scraps of paneling, fireplaces and other details throughout the building -- like a entire window of leaded glass, battered and patched with tape, facing the rear courtyard.</p>
        <p>Louis Comfort Tiffany built a strong artistic reputation, and perhaps his studio building is the last of his works to remain undiscovered.</p>
