        <p>To the Editor: As a cancer surgeon, I found Eleanor Blau's article [''Taking Arms Against Stage Fright,'' Sept. 20] particularly relevant. Musicians and surgeons both train for many unrelenting and often torturous years to be able to deliver a performance as close to perfection as possible. Certainly too much adrenaline can diminish the performance, but no anxiety can be just as bad.</p>
        <p>The brain needs a low level of adrenalines to be at its best performance level. Operating on the aorta or playing the cello, one must be constantly aware of problems yet to happen, adapt to changes as they occur and be hyperaware of one's surroundings. The pianist Ignaz Solzhenitsyn reminded me of this in 1996 when he played J. S. Bach's English Suites at the Palace Theater in New Haven. Almost immediately upon beginning, the piano's A-flat key became hopelessly stuck. He tried to free it, but seeing no other choice, and seemingly unfazed and in total control, he finished the entire performance perfectly, except of course, for every A-flat in the work.</p>

        <p>It was also reassuring to read in the article of Mstislav Rostropovich's tripping Vladimir Feltsman during his entrance to cure Mr. Feltsman's stage fright. Perhaps I should use the same technique on our younger residents as they walk into the operating room for their first big case.</p>
