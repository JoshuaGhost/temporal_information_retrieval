        <p>Several hours before the American League Championship Series began on Tuesday, all the Cleveland Indians were corralled in their clubhouse before batting practice. All but one. Jim Thome kept pacing the corridor beneath Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''How cold is it out there, Cleveland-like cold?'' he asked a few hallway loiterers.</p>
        <p>He continued to pace while whirling a bat in his hand until it was the Indians' turn at batting practice. As Thome stood on the field, with the red-white-and-blue bunting in the background, he looked around and displayed a smile as big as a half moon.</p>
        <p>''This is what it is all about,'' Thome said. ''You cannot beat this.''</p>
        <p>His enthusiasm was pure as he began this series, and it never wavered, no matter how disappointing his at-bats. Even after he struck out once in Game 1 and three times in Game 2, he refused to get frustrated or uptight and kept on swinging freely until something connected in Game 3 against the Yankees tonight.</p>
        <p>Thome wheeled his sturdy frame and made contact with two Andy Pettitte fastballs, both of which ended up over the wall and into a roaring crowd in right field at Jacobs Field. Thome's two home runs -- one a solo shot estimated at 421 feet in the second inning, the other a two-run rainbow estimated at 369 feet in the fifth inning -- put the Indians firmly in control to win Game 3, 6-1, and they helped provide Cleveland with a 2-1 lead in the series.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I've been having a hard time with left-handed pitching lately,'' said Thome, whose right hand was fractured by a pitch on Aug. 7, causing him to miss a month of playing time. ''They've been trying to establish the fastball inside. I was fortunate tonight to get ahead in the count and get a good pitch to hit. I've been having such a hard time lately that it wasn't on my mind to hit two home runs. I was just trying to put it in play.''</p>
        <p>This is as good as Thome has looked since returning to the lineup on Sept. 16. He finished the last 12 games of the season hitting .195 with one home run.</p>
        <p>''I saw I palm reader, so I knew,'' Manager Mike Hargrove joked when asked if he knew Thome was ready to break out. ''No, Jimmy is a good hitter. Look over his career and see what he has done.''</p>
        <p>Thome has always had a knack for the home run. In the fifth inning, his second homer barely crept over the wall in right.</p>
        <p>''The way Paul O'Neill was going back, I didn't know if it was going,'' Thome said of the Yankee right fielder. ''I was trying to blow it out.''</p>
        <p>Thome was one of three Indians to hit homers off Pettitte in the fifth inning, which put the Indians ahead, 6-1. Manny Ramirez and Mark Whiten joined Thome in their show of power. And it was a show, all right, as Thome thrashed his way out of a 1-for-8 slump through Games 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>''When you get good pitching like we have lately, it's contagious,'' Thome said. ''The offense just relaxes.''</p>
        <p>Thome looked at ease despite his recent struggles as he tried to get adjusted to swinging the bat with a pad on his healing hand.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, the pad wasn't really the problem,'' he said. ''It just felt like spring training all over again, especially against left-hand pitching. The first week back, I was just trying to get a feel for everything again. Hitting is about momentum and getting good pitches to hit.''</p>
        <p>After Cleveland's disastrous loss in Game 1 and its fluke-aided victory in Game 2, no one could argue the merits of the Indians victory in Game 3. Obviously, they are not daunted by the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''We know the Yankees have been the team to beat,'' Thome said. ''For us, going in you have to bring your game to another level. We've won because our pitching has put us in a situation where we could win. After the first inning, you could see the momentum shift tonight.''</p>
        <p>In the second inning, Thome sent up his first home run of the night. It was a release of the nervous energy that he had been building since hours before the series even began.</p>
