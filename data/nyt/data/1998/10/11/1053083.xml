        <p>IT is tempting on meeting Ted and Sherry Scofield to slot them into a New York stereotype of the Young Southerners: innocent and naive, just arrived in the big city, ready and waiting to be marked by fate.</p>
        <p>But even before moving here, they figured out something many people never really understand: It's a waste of time to ask other people where to live, because the answers will always be biased. ''Everyone is loyal to their neighborhood,'' Mr. Scofield said.</p>
        <p>Instead they set out on their own, using Web sites while still living in Nashville to figure out which neighborhood, which building and which apartment met their nonnegotiable list of demands: a lot of space, a terrace, and a washer and dryer.</p>
        <p>They were used to big places, to a horizontal life, to a bathroom that was 250 square feet with two sinks and a Jacuzzi. So they knew they couldn't just arrive in August, when Mr. Scofield, after graduating from Vanderbilt University's joint program in law and business, would start as an associate at the law firm of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe.</p>
        <p>They came up with a plan, which isn't surprising from two people who are happy to say that their furniture in New York is arranged just as it was in Nashville.</p>
        <p>As he clicked on sites, Mr. Scofield compiled data on sales prices and decided it made more sense to buy than rent, partly because he believed from charts he developed that prices might still go up, that the peak had not yet been reached.</p>
        <p>After deciding to buy, he became E-mail friends with Paul Purcell, the relocation manager at Douglas Elliman, who quickly advised them about things like the differences between co-ops and condos. Mr. Purcell did not think they would be approved by any co-op board, Mr. Scofield said. ''We have a good income, but nothing in the bank,'' he said.</p>
        <p>CONDOS, which do not require board approval, became their focus. The decision vastly narrowed their search, because condos make up a lesser proportion of the available housing. The Scofields downloaded market data, floor plans and descriptions of condominium buildings. They used general sites, like www.nyrealty.com and www.nyc-condos.com, as well as those of individual brokerage companies, like www.elliman.com, to help amplify the skimpy and sometimes misleading information they said they found in classified ads.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scofield printed out dozens of floor plans to examine with his wife. One of the first buildings whose plans they liked was Evans Tower, a condo at 171 East 84th Street, which they eventually chose, because it was relatively near Central Park and had a health club, roof deck and pool. Mrs. Scofield, a nurse who worked in sports medicine in Nashville and is just beginning her job hunt here,  likes to run.</p>
        <p>Their E-mail adviser at Elliman connected them with Kerry T. Martin, a Douglas Elliman broker he believed they would like. They had heard stories about ''odd, snippy'' New York brokers, but Ms. Martin's charm and helpfulness -- perhaps cultivated by some time spent in the South -- proved a pleasant surprise, they said. They faxed floor plans back and forth, getting her advice, narrowing their list.</p>
        <p>By spring break, Ms. Martin had  two dozen places to show them.They liked Evans Tower best, but nothing was available. So they kept looking, still using the Internet but conscious of its limitations. The Web sites of the brokerage firms were useful for only a general overview, they said, because the sites were often out of date. ''You couldn't trust them for shopping,'' Mr. Scofield said.</p>
        <p>Finally, just before they would have had to choose someplace else, an apartment in Evans Tower became available. Like an already-sold unit they had seen, it had a large bedroom, plentiful storage, a washer and dryer, a small terrace, parquet floors and an L-shaped living room/ dining area with a galley kitchen. They put in a bid for $342,500 -- just below the $345,000 asking price -- without ever seeing it, and signed a contract. The monthly total of common charges and taxes is $1,093.</p>
        <p>Unable to get a mortgage from a New York bank for the amount they wanted, they turned to National City Bank in Louisville, which had given Mr. Scofield a car loan when he was 16.</p>
        <p>A few hours after taking the New York bar exam in August -- he will get the results next month -- and just an hour before the closing, Mr. Scofield saw the apartment for the first time. Fortunately, with a nonrefundable deposit at stake, he liked it. But they weren't surprised. ''We trusted Kerry to come over and look and say it was good,'' Mrs. Scofield said.</p>
