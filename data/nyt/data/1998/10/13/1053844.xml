        <p>A single-engine plane was hit by a tail wind and crashed into trees at the end of a runway yesterday morning, the State Police said.</p>
        <p>The pilot and two of the three passengers were slightly injured and the rented plane incurred heavy damage when it crashed at Sky Manor Airport in rural Alexandia Township, Hunterdon County, said Sgt. Daniel Cosgrove, a spokesman for the State Police.</p>
        <p>The pilot, Oscar Mendez, 30, of Brooklyn, suffered bruises and a cut on the head, and two passengers, Polanco Danilo, 21, of Brooklyn, and Christian Vanegas, 19, of Woodside, Queens, both had lower back injuries. A third passenger, Antonio Rodriguez, 31, of Brooklyn, was not hurt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendez, said the tail wind forced him to abort his first landing attempt, and that he tried to abort a second attempt, but was unable to gain enough altitude to clear the trees.</p>
