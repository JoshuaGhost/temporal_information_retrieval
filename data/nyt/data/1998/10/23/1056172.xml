      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Brawn without brains can't accomplish much beyond wreaking glorious, mindless destruction. That's the message that leaks through ''Soldier,'' a high-testosterone science-fiction fantasy starring Kurt Russell as a professional fighter trained from birth to be nothing other than an efficient killing machine.</p>
        <p>In the movie's grim opening scenes, we watch the education of Mr. Russell's character, Todd, who is nurtured in an incubator at a special hospital devoted to producing lethal warriors. As a boy, Todd learns to watch with unblinking calm while attack dogs tear apart a man. He is indifferent when a classmate, lagging behind in a long-distance race, is deemed useless and casually executed by an instructor. By age 21, Todd's face has frozen into an expressionless glare. His name and number are tattooed on one cheek  and a bicep is inscribed with his war record.</p>

        <p>Brawn without brains can't accomplish much beyond wreaking glorious, mindless destruction. That's the message that leaks through ''Soldier,'' a high-testosterone science-fiction fantasy starring Kurt Russell as a professional fighter trained from birth to be nothing other than an efficient killing machine.</p>
        <p>In the movie's grim opening scenes, we watch the education of Mr. Russell's character, Todd, who is nurtured in an incubator at a special hospital devoted to producing lethal warriors. As a boy, Todd learns to watch with unblinking calm while attack dogs tear apart a man. He is indifferent when a classmate, lagging behind in a long-distance race, is deemed useless and casually executed by an instructor. By age 21, Todd's face has frozen into an expressionless glare. His name and number are tattooed on one cheek  and a bicep is inscribed with his war record.</p>
        <p>Like most science-fiction movies, ''Soldier,'' directed by Paul Anderson from a script by David Webb Peoples, is much better at the windup than at the pitch. The drama begins when Todd, in his 40's and battle-scarred but still one of the toughest men alive, suddenly finds his generation of soldier about to be replaced by a new genetically enhanced model.</p>
        <p>In a chilling demonstration of technological progress, Todd and two fellow soldiers are ordered to fight Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee), the sleek younger leader of the new breed, while all four are clinging to rope chains. Caine quickly dispatches Todd's cohorts, then Todd collapses, but not before putting out one of Caine's eyes. Severely wounded  and assumed to be dead, the middle-aged warrior is whisked by space-age garbage scow to a remote planet that serves as a junkyard and dumped onto a giant scrapheap.</p>
        <p>But the planet, assumed to be uninhabited, turns out to have a secret life. The dying soldier is discovered and nursed back to health by a colony of hardy, peace-loving space pioneers whose ship crashed and left them stranded. In only a few weeks, Todd is strenuously working out with a metal punching bag and having flashbacks while he bloodies his fists.</p>
        <p>''Soldier'' quickly becomes as  sticky and predictable as a mediocre episode of ''Star Trek.'' Befriended by a gentle pioneer settler and his beautiful blond wife, Sandra (Connie Nielsen), who discreetly ogles the hunky warrior, Todd has his first experiences of human warmth. The couple's little boy, who hasn't spoken since he was bitten by one of the nasty green snakes that infest the planet, also takes a shine to Todd.</p>
        <p>But soon the new generation's troops, deployed by the arrogant, power-mad bureaucrat who is promoting them, show up for a training exercise in which they have orders to destroy anyone who happens to be on the planet. The new generation is physically stronger and faster than the old, but not as smart. The last third of ''Soldier'' is a dull, phony-looking series of fiery scenes culminating in an inevitable showdown between Todd and Caine. The action is strictly routine.</p>
        <p>''Soldier'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violent scenes, including an eye-gouging.</p>
        <p>SOLDIER  Directed by Paul Anderson; written by David Webb Peoples; director of photography, David Tattersall; edited by Martin Hunter; music by Joel McNeely; production designer, David L. Snyder; produced by Jerry Weintraub; released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 99 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
        <p>WITH: Kurt Russell (Todd), Jason Scott Lee (Caine 607), Connie Nielsen (Sandra), Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig), Gary Busey (Church), Sean Pertwee (Mace) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum).</p>
