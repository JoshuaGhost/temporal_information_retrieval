        <p>Nan Goldin  Matthew Marks Gallery  522 West 22d Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 28</p>
        <p>The most beautiful photographs in Nan Goldin's show, and there are a handful of them among these 34 new works, have a quality of indirection that is not her usual mode. Landscapes or near-landscapes like ''Self-Portrait on Bridge at Golden River, Silver Hill,'' which come from her time in a detox clinic, they lean toward abstraction, the dense colors dominant as expressive containers, the atmosphere melancholic or ecstatic but in a contained way. Ms. Goldin here seems to be aiming toward a kind of Symbolism, which combines an increased (for her) visual opulence with the natural warmth of human character that has always been the saving grace of her work.</p>

        <p>Nan Goldin  Matthew Marks Gallery  522 West 22d Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 28</p>
        <p>The most beautiful photographs in Nan Goldin's show, and there are a handful of them among these 34 new works, have a quality of indirection that is not her usual mode. Landscapes or near-landscapes like ''Self-Portrait on Bridge at Golden River, Silver Hill,'' which come from her time in a detox clinic, they lean toward abstraction, the dense colors dominant as expressive containers, the atmosphere melancholic or ecstatic but in a contained way. Ms. Goldin here seems to be aiming toward a kind of Symbolism, which combines an increased (for her) visual opulence with the natural warmth of human character that has always been the saving grace of her work.</p>
        <p>That said, most of what is on view misses this balance and veers into the realm of self-indulgent travelogue, the photographs often being less impressive than the places where they were taken, which she includes in her titles: ''Primin by the Window, Stechelberg, Switzerland,'' for example, and ''Guido on the Dock, Venice,'' a misty blue picture basically indistinguishable from the sentimental photographs used in perfume advertisements.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldin's art has been good in the past because it has been true to a world that is her own. It has been mostly about the other people in that world, who are her friends. Now, obviously, with success having expanded her purview (many of the pictures were taken while she was traveling to various places with the retrospective of her photographs that was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art), she is chronicling a life more akin to a touring rock star's, its subject too often becoming a certain chic languor that is not very interesting or original.</p>
