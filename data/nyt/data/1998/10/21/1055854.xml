        <p>The San Diego Padres had a 5-2 lead in Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday night with their ace, Kevin Brown, on the mound. They had a 3-2 lead in tonight's Game 3 with the premier closer in the National League, Trevor Hoffman, on the mound.</p>
        <p>The Padres lost both games. And now they just might be thinking: what do we have to do to beat the Yankees?</p>

        <p>The San Diego Padres had a 5-2 lead in Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday night with their ace, Kevin Brown, on the mound. They had a 3-2 lead in tonight's Game 3 with the premier closer in the National League, Trevor Hoffman, on the mound.</p>
        <p>The Padres lost both games. And now they just might be thinking: what do we have to do to beat the Yankees?</p>
        <p>''You start thinking like that,'' San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy said after the Padres came within one defeat of being swept in the Series. ''We had them on the ropes in two games and they came back. It just shows how good the Yankees are.</p>
        <p>''The only thing we can do is play our hearts out. Our backs are so far against the wall, we can't back up anymore. They just have so many weapons over there. Brosius just killed us tonight.''</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius, the Yankee third baseman, belted a pair of home runs after the Padres had taken a 3-0 lead. Brosius' first homer came against Sterling Hitchcock leading off the seventh inning, after San Diego had rallied for three runs off David Cone in the bottom of the sixth. Brosius' second homer came off Hoffman in the top of the eighth, turning a 3-2 deficit into a 5-3 Yankee lead.</p>
        <p>''What's so disheartening is that it could very easily be two games to one Padres, and it's not,'' San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said after the 5-4 loss. ''We're kind of in Atlanta's shoes now.''</p>
        <p>Towers was referring to the National League Championship Series, in which the Padres took a 3-0 lead before Atlanta became the first team to rally back from three games down to win more than one. The Braves won two. But no team has ever come all the way back from such a deficit.</p>
        <p>''They beat us twice here, and we had to go back to their place,'' Towers said of the Braves. ''And we started thinking a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Right now, the only positive thing the Padres can be thinking is that they will have Brown on the mound for Wednesday night's Game 4.</p>
        <p>''We've got a pretty good chance going with Kevin tomorrow,'' catcher Jim Leyritz said.</p>
        <p>''It sounds silly,'' Hitchcock, who turned in another fine performance, said when asked just what the Padres have to do to beat the Yankees once, never mind four times. ''But it basically comes down to getting 27 outs and leaving with the lead.''</p>
        <p>The symbol of the Padres' futility has been Ken Caminiti, who two years ago was the National League's most valuable player. Tonight, Caminiti made a crucial error at third base in the seventh, which led to the Yankees' second run. Caminiti also drove in San Diego's third run in the sixth with a sacrifice fly to deep center.</p>
        <p>But Caminiti fell down on a number of swings while striking out against Mariano Rivera with the tying run on in the eighth to finish 0 for 3. He is 1 for 10 in the Series.</p>
        <p>Caminiti slammed the door in the trainer's room to get therapy on his left leg (he had fouled a ball off the back of his knee), an injury that goes along with his sore left quad, sore groin and sore lower back.</p>
        <p>And Caminiti is not the only one struggling. Not by a long shot.</p>
        <p>''There is a way to beat them,'' the San Diego pitching coach, Dave Stewart, said. ''We just haven't put the right combination together. It all comes down to pitching aggressively, getting ahead in the count and not making any mistakes.''</p>
        <p>When the Padres err, the Yankees have made them pay dearly.</p>
        <p>''If we can win tomorrow, there's a Thursday,'' Towers said. ''And if we can win again, we're on a plane back to New York. It means having to beat Pettitte, Wells, El Duque and Cone. But we knocked off Randy Johnson twice, John Smoltz, Tommy Glavine and Greg Maddux. It will be difficult to win four. But it could happen.''</p>
        <p>Right now, the Padres would settle for just one.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>San Diego General Manager KEVIN TOWERS said he had been contacted by teams who would probably request permission to speak with the the Padres' pitching coach, DAVE STEWART, about a front-office job after the season. ''I'd be very surprised if he comes back as our pitching coach,'' Towers said of Stewart, who has been given much of the credit for the turnaround the Padre staff has made this season. . . . Towers also said that even if a new stadium initiative passes, he will probably not have the money to re-sign all of his biggest potential free agents, KEVIN BROWN, KEN CAMINITI, WALLY JOYNER and STEVE FINLEY.</p>
