        <p>IMPROVING the car and the driver -- installing air bags, for example, and cracking down on drunkenness -- have been celebrated in the fight against auto fatalities that has steadily lowered the highway death toll over the years.</p>
        <p>But few people think much about the third part of the safety triad: the work that goes into making the roads themselves safer.</p>
        <p>Some experts call it the next great frontier of safety engineering, an opportunity to cheat death by pouring concrete, building barriers, removing obstacles, installing new technologies and generally outsmarting the forces of physics that make crashes deadly.</p>
        <p>A more cynical view holds that road builders simply want bigger roads carrying more cars faster, if more safely, because that approach uses the most concrete.</p>
        <p>Either way, tens of thousands of lives are at stake.</p>
        <p>Take a motorist who enters Buffalo via  the Canadian border. Traveling east, he will probably take Interstate 90, a road designed to exacting Federal safety standards. But if he heads south, he might elect Route 219, a similarly busy road that is not part of the Interstate system and that experts say is much more dangerous.</p>
        <p>Other examples abound. Going from Washington to the Baltimore-Washington International Airport, for instance, the choice is between Interstate 95, a road of fearsome reputation in the area, with long-distance trucks and hotheaded commuters battling for primacy, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, a tree-lined but older and narrower artery.</p>
        <p>Despite the obvious drawbacks, the prudent alternative is Interstate 95. That is because, when it comes to safety, it is hard to compete with an interstate.</p>
        <p>With a fatality rate of 0.74 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles traveled (in 1994), the 45,583 miles of Interstates were twice as safe as the next safest class of roads, the 159,080 non-Interstate primary highways, where the fatality rate was 1.48, according to data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
        <p>On 743,232 other highways that receive Federal aid, the rate was 1.81; and on the 2,958,649 miles of roads that receive no Federal aid, the rate was 2.31 fatalities per hundred million vehicle miles.</p>
        <p>''The dramatic differences in fatality rates suggest that it is possible to have safer roads'' by adopting stricter engineering guidelines more broadly, said a report by the Roadway Safety Foundation, a Washington consortium of insurance and transportation industry groups that studies how to make safer roads.</p>
        <p>Not that Interstates are problem-free.</p>
        <p>For example, because of an apparent increase in accidents in which a vehicle crosses the grassy strip, officials are studying whether higher speeds on highways mean that Interstate median strips are not wide enough. And Interstate access ramps might also need to be redesigned.</p>
        <p>Changes in American tastes in vehicles are also affecting how engineers look at roads. The increasingly popular high-riding vans, minivans, small trucks and sport utility vehicles are more likely than old-fashioned sedans to roll over, especially when they run off the road. The narrow shoulders and steep side slopes of many roads in the United States, which were designed before these vehicles became vogue, only compound this potentially dangerous situation.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities recently banned the use of two kinds of guardrails on major highways because tests show that full-size pickup trucks tend to roll over when they hit them. Officials said there are thousands of miles of this kind of guardrail already on highways, but that it would be too expensive to remove them. It is not known whether sport utility vehicles and minivans are threatened by these rails.</p>
        <p>Conversely, lighter and smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles may behave differently when they hit guardrails, breakaway poles and other highway structures.</p>
        <p>The new guidelines are part of a program to reduce the number and severity of run-off-the-road crashes through better-designed guardrails, rumble strips on shoulders, improved signs and pavement markings and skid-resistant pavements. Hazardous roadways are a factor in approximately a third of all fatal crashes, said William Fay, the president of the American Highway Users Alliance, which lobbies for road construction.</p>
        <p>The most pressing problems are on the smaller and less traveled highways, which cannot feasibly be brought up to Interstate design standards. Indeed, about three-fourths of all traffic fatalities occur on two-lane roads, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Many of the accidents involve cars hitting trees, utility poles or bridge supports, many of which could be removed or redesigned.</p>
        <p>With their narrower lanes and shoulders, rolls and curves, steep side slopes and railroad crossings, and with safety decisions in the hands of local governments without vast financial resources, these roads have the lowest safety levels, the highest crash rates and the fewest features intended for preventing death and injury when accidents occur.</p>
        <p>THE trick is to find inexpensive, easily built improvements on these roads, experts say.</p>
        <p>Detailed studies by the Federal Highway Administration examining decades of road projects, show that some types of spending are more effective than others when their costs are compared with the resulting cuts in deaths and injuries from crashes.</p>
        <p>Lighting, for example, is one of the most cost-effective road improvements. Median barriers are another. These enhancements are usually three or four times as cost-effective as upgrading traffic signals, the studies found.</p>
        <p>Take the problem of crashes from running off the road -- a type of accident that accounts for more than 11,000 deaths a year, or about 30 percent of driving fatalities. (Twenty years ago, this kind of crash accounted for just 20 pecent of deaths.)</p>
        <p>A research study found that on two-lane rural roads where side slopes were flattened from a 2-to-1 slope to a 6-to-1 slope, the number of single-vehicle accidents could be lowered by 21 percent.</p>
        <p>Other improvements to protect drivers who run off the road are poles that break away on impact, rumble strips to warn drivers that they are straying onto the shoulder and better signs and pavement markings.</p>
        <p>Adding shoulders where there are none and widening narrow shoulders can also yield double-digit reductions in accidents, the report showed. About 86 percent of the rural mileage on the nation's principal non-Interstate highways are too narrow to meet modern standards, according to the Transportation Department.</p>
        <p>Representative Bud Shuster, the Pennsylvania Republican who steered the $217.3 billion, six-year transportation bill through Congress, cited estimates that its road improvements will save about 4,000 lives a year. Mr. Fay said, ''A lot of the roads in the United States are just not safe, either because they aren't in very good condition or because they aren't designed for the kind of traffic that they now are carrying.''</p>
