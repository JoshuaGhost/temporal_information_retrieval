        <p>As is his policy, General Manager Steve Phillips of the Mets would not articulate how he planned to approach an attempt to sign Mike Piazza. But a person with knowledge of Phillips's strategy confirmed yesterday that Phillips would fly to Southern California early next week to make an offer to the All-Star catcher and his representatives.</p>
        <p>I have no comment, Phillips said yesterday.</p>

        <p>As is his policy, General Manager Steve Phillips of the Mets would not articulate how he planned to approach an attempt to sign Mike Piazza. But a person with knowledge of Phillips's strategy confirmed yesterday that Phillips would fly to Southern California early next week to make an offer to the All-Star catcher and his representatives.</p>
        <p>I have no comment, Phillips said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mets ownership has made no secret of its desire to retain Piazza, a sentiment Nelson Doubleday, the team's co-owner, reiterated on Wednesday. Piazza rejected a six-year, $84 million deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers before he was traded to Florida on May 15 and then to the Mets on May 22. He can become a free agent 15 days after the World Series.</p>
        <p>Piazza batted .329 with 32 homers and 111 runs batted in for the Dodgers, Marlins and Mets this season; .348 with 23 homers and 76 r.b.i. in 109 games with the Mets.</p>
        <p>Neither Piazza nor his main representative, Dan Lozano, could be reached for comment yesterday. Both are vacationing and are not scheduled to return to California until Sunday.</p>
