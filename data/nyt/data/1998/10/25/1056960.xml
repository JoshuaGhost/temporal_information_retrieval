        <p>Over the last three and a half months, nearly 1,300 prospective jurors have filed into court here and answered questions about whether they could fairly determine the guilt or innocence of a suspect in a series of murders and then possibly sentence him to death.</p>

        <p>Over the last three and a half months, nearly 1,300 prospective jurors have filed into court here and answered questions about whether they could fairly determine the guilt or innocence of a suspect in a series of murders and then possibly sentence him to death.</p>
        <p>Judge Arthur G. Pitts of Suffolk County Criminal Court announced today that 12 jurors and 11 alternate jurors had finally been chosen to hear the case against Robert Shulman, a former postal worker accused of killing three prostitutes. It is the first death-penalty case on Long Island in 21 years.</p>
        <p>Although there are always problems in finding jurors who are able to serve for many months, there is one additional element that complicates the process in capital cases: moral judgment.</p>
        <p>''The penalty phase involves moral reasoning, which is a much more subjective process and entirely different from the factual determination of guilt or innocence,'' said Kevin M. Doyle, the chief of the state's new Capital Defenders Office. ''That's why it has taken courts months to pick juries in capital murder cases, especially if it's done properly.''</p>
        <p>The potential jurors for the Shulman jury filled out a 61-page questionnaire eliciting their views on everything from lawyers and psychiatrists to the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Under closer questioning from the prosecutor in the case, Georgia Tschiember, and Mr. Shulman's defense lawyers, Paul Gianelli and William Keahon, the questions focused on moral issues to determine, among other things, whether a ''death-qualified'' jury -- people who say they are able to condemn someone to die -- might be inherently conservative in nature. The fear for defense lawyers is that such a jury could be more likely not only to convict Mr. Shulman, but also to sentence him to death, rather than consider the alternative of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that, by itself, could become a matter for the appeals court,'' said Eric M. Freedman, a professor at Hofstra Law School who is an expert on the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman said the state's three-year-old death penalty law was not based on any existing model approved and tested in other states, but was ''written on a blank piece of paper,'' leaving many legal questions unanswered. Eventually, he said, these questions will have to be answered by the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>The first such test of the law was argued before the high court on Oct. 13, when lawyers contended that the statute's plea-bargaining provisions were unconstitutional because they coerced defendants into pleading guilty rather than risking a death sentence.</p>
        <p>Since the law took effect in New York on Sept. 1, 1995, prosecutors in the state have sought the death penalty in 31 murder cases. (For a defendant to be sentenced to death, the jury must reach a unanimous decision on both the matter of guilt and penalty. Should they fail to agree on the penalty, the statute requires that the decision be made by the judge.)</p>
        <p>So far, two of these cases have gone through both the trial and penalty phases, and the defendants have been sentenced. In the first case, in June, a jury in Brooklyn sentenced to death a former jail guard, Darrel K. Harris, 40, for fatally shooting three people during a robbery at a social club. In July, a jury in Dutchess County found Dalkeith McIntosh, a 38-year-old immigrant from Jamaica, guilty of murdering his estranged wife and her daughter, but sentenced him to prison for life, rather than death by lethal injection.</p>
        <p>The results of these two cases have only further confounded some experts who use demographic information -- including sex, age, race and religion -- to study juries in death penalty cases. While these experts expected the Dutchess County jury to be more conservative, it decided against death. The Brooklyn jury, which was expected to be more liberal, voted for the death penalty.</p>
        <p>In Suffolk County, where juries are regarded as generally conservative, lawyers hesitate to pursue a liberal defense, knowing that jurors are less likely, for example, to accept an insanity defense.</p>
        <p>Picking a death-penalty jury can place the defense at an added disadvantage. For example, Mr. Gianelli, one of the defense lawyers, found himself arguing to keep a juror who said he was already convinced of Mr. Shulman's guilt but was willing to consider sentencing him to life in prison without parole rather than to death.</p>
        <p>But Richard C. Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, pointed to difficulties in labeling prospective jurors.</p>
        <p>''People have all sorts of shades of views on the death penalty and many people don't really know what their moral stance is until they actually have to make a real decision,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shulman, 44, a former postal worker in Hicksville, is accused of bludgeoning five women to death and dismembering four of them. He is being tried here for the murder of three of the victims whose bodies he discarded in trash bins in Suffolk County. He also faces trial for murder in Westchester County, where the bodies of the other two women were found. Although he has signed a confession to the murders, he has entered a plea of not guilty.</p>
        <p>Judge Pitts instructed all 23 jurors to be in court on Tuesday morning for opening arguments in a trial that is expected to last at least as long as the protracted jury selection process.</p>
