        <p>As they left Washington this weekend for the election break, Congressional Republicans were either muttering that President Clinton had once again taken them to the cleaners or defending their retreat in the last-minute budget showdown. Democrats heading for the airport were laughing, joking and enjoying the opposition's discomfort.</p>
        <p>This picture of partisan triumph and unity has momentarily obscured the President's odd relationship with his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill. The party's Congressional leaders now stand in front of what looks to be an impressively united phalanx of support for Mr. Clinton against impeachment-minded Republicans.</p>
        <p>Yet there is a softness to their backing; a drop in Mr. Clinton's approval rating or an unexpected election setback might find the Democrats distancing themselves once again from the President. No one has forgotten the deep ideological divisions of the past -- over the North American Free Trade Agreement, welfare reform and other far-reaching changes in American life made possible by the tactical alliance of the White House and Congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>But the mutual distrust between Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats shouldn't surprise us. It is an old story, with a new twist.</p>
        <p>It used to be that liberal Democratic Presidents tangled with Democratic conservatives in Congress. More recently, moderate Democrats in the White House have coexisted uneasily with the liberal core of the party on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>In 1938, Franklin Roosevelt, infuriated by the resistance of many Southern Democratic senators to the New Deal, tried to purge recalcitrants by intervening in selected state primaries. He failed miserably. One of his targets, Walter George of Georgia, reportedly responded to a remark that the President was his own worst enemy by saying, ''Not while I'm alive!'' George stayed alive, and in the Senate, for another 19 years.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt remained much loved in Georgia and throughout the South as a champion of the common people. Senator George, for better or worse, represented an equally strong side of his state and region -- a tradition that included states' rights, suspicion of organized labor and defense of Jim Crow. Roosevelt successfully appealed to voting groups by voicing  political ideas that were anathema to Senator George but had a broad national base. Despite their differences, both men maintained a surface cordiality and participated in all the rituals of party solidarity.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt's successor, Harry Truman, was a Senate man with numerous friendships among Southern legislators. Yet once he became President, his relationship with Southern Democrats deteriorated. Truman's advocacy of civil rights led to the 1948 Dixiecrat insurgency led by Strom Thurmond, then the Governor of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>After his narrow re-election victory, Truman concluded he could not expel the Dixiecrats from the party or even reduce their power in Congress. For the remainder of his Presidency, Southern conservatives blocked most of his Fair Deal program.</p>
        <p>John Kennedy likewise struggled to move a liberal domestic agenda against conservative forces in his own party, again mostly from the South. Lyndon Johnson was in a similar bind until his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in 1964 swept a host of new liberal Democrats into Congress and made his Great Society programs possible.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, Watergate terminated Richard Nixon's attempt at building a Republican majority and produced yet another class of liberal Democrats on Capitol Hill like Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Over time, they became solidly entrenched and increasingly powerful in a manner similar to that of the old conservative Southerners.</p>
        <p>Yet the country moved in another direction, reacting against the excesses of the Great Society and the counterculture of the 1960's. The South itself was transformed by Northern migration and black voters.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, the quest for the Presidency has usually involved an effort to stake a plausible claim to the middle of the road, but liberal Democrats have retained their party dominance in Congress. It is no accident that the last two Democratic Presidents have both been Southern centrists who found themselves frequently at odds with hard-to-handle liberals in their own party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has performed an adroit tightrope act, proclaiming the end of big government, calling for balanced budgets, school uniforms and tougher law enforcement while also advocating national health insurance, bashing the tobacco companies and courting feminists, blacks, gays and organized labor. He has been especially effective in addressing the anxieties of women concerned with education, the environment and the workplace. Rather than appreciating the virtuosity of this performance, however, many Congressional liberals have chafed at Mr. Clinton's incrementalism and his slights.</p>
        <p>In the 1996 Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton even implied that he would be content if the Republicans retained a majority in Congress. His strategy of triangulation -- the rhetorical co-optation of Republican ideas modified only by bits and pieces of the liberal Democratic program -- was the key to his success.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, liberals have been less dismayed than moderates by the Monica Lewinsky mess, with its overtones of 1960's counterculture. Thus, liberal Democrats like Representative Charles Rangel of New York have become Mr. Clinton's strongest defenders, while ''New Democrats'' like Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut have been harshly critical of him.</p>
        <p>Whatever Mr. Clinton's future holds, the differences between Democratic Presidents and their Congressional liberals will probably reassert themselves, sooner rather than later, and President Clinton may find himself acting more like a liberal than he would prefer.</p>
