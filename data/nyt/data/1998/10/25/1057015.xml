        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Though a gay-rights activist, I write to defend the behavior of New York City police officers at last Monday's demonstration against the killing of Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming college student.</p>
        <p>Contrary to the contention of one of the organizers that ''we were doing nothing illegal, wrong or unsafe'' (news article, Oct. 20), the attempt to lead 4,000 people down Fifth Avenue during the end of rush hour was all three. While I participated in the march, it was my observation that the police displayed commendable sensitivity to the marchers, accompanied by a degree of forcefulness necessitated by the leaderless push of the crowd.</p>

        <p>I am a strong believer in the efficacy of civil disobedience, especially in response to public indifference to injustice. But the gay and straight communities would have been better served by a peaceful contemplation of the tragedy.</p>
