        <p>U.C.L.A. 28, CALIFORNIA 16</p>
        <p>For a few moments today, the U.C.L.A. Bruins, who are ranked second in both the New York Times computer rating and the Associated Press poll, appeared vulnerable.</p>
        <p>With U.C.L.A. leading by 21-9 lat ein the third quarter, California quarterback Justin Vedder threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Joel Young to pull the Golden Bears within 5 points and inject the team with new lift. The vaunted Bruin offense, which was averaging 497.6 yards going into the game, was sputtering at 261 yards entering the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>But the moment passed quickly. Quarterback Cade McNown answered California's score with a 5-play, 67-yard drive that was capped by a 30-yard option pass from tailback Jermaine Lewis to Jon Dubravac to extend the advantage and help the Bruins go on to a 28-16 victory in front of 55,000 at Memorial Stadium.</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A. (6-0) survived with both its national title aspirations and its 16-game winning streak intact.</p>
        <p>''We're ranked second in the nation and we've continued the longest win streak in the country,'' U.CL.A. Coach Bob Toledo said. ''There's pressure, sure, but I'd rather have that than the alternative.''</p>
        <p>California had its chances. The Bruins turned the ball over the first two times they touched it, gave up a safety and committed 12 penalties for 112 yards. And while McNown was solidonce again, completing 15 of 27 passes for 182 yards while throwing two first-half touchdown passes to split end Brian Poli-Dixon, it was the Bruins' defense that kept California's upset hopes at bay.</p>
        <p>Free safety Larry Atkins intercepted a pass at U.C.L.A.'s goal line on California's opening possession and then recovered a fumble on U.C.L.A.'s 3-yard line that stopped a Calfornia drive at the end of the first half. The Bruins made a goal-line stand midway through the third quarter as California had four chances at the end zone from inside the 3 and came away empty-handed.</p>
        <p>''That was a real emotional turning point in the game,'' U.C.L.A. inside linebacker Ryan Nece said, referring to the goal-line stand. ''Having goal-line stands like that is what a No. 2 team is supposed to do.''</p>
        <p>After California scored the first touchdown of the game, U.C.L.A. answered on its next two possessions.Sparked by a 40-yard run by fullback Durell Price, the Bruins marched 91 yards in 10 plays. The drive ended when McNown hit Poli-Dixon over the middle with a 17-yard touchdown pass. Following a California punt, McNown found an outstretched Poli-Dixon for a spectacular 35-yard touchdown to put U.C.L.A. up for good with 3 minutes 26 seconds left in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>''There's a reason why we've won 16 straight, and McNown is a big part of it,'' Toledo said.</p>
        <p>California outside linebacker Sekou Sanyika tackled Lewis in the end zone for a safety to cut U.C.L.A.'s lead to 14-9 with 11:49 left in the half. McNown, however, directed an 83-yard drive - 34 yards coming on a third-down run by McNown - that ended in Lewis's 13-yard touchdown run to put U.C.L.A. ahead by 21-9 heading into halftime.</p>
