        <p>MYSTERY fans who normally spend Thursday nights curled up in front of PBS may want to program their VCR's this week and head out for Douglass College in New Brunswick, where 10 writers will drop some clues about how they thicken their plots.</p>
        <p>''Women With an Attitude: The Lady Investigates'' will conclude an all-day symposium sponsored by Sisters in Crime, the national association of female mystery writers. The symposium celebrates the donation of the organization's papers to the Mabel Smith Douglass Library, where an exhibition of books, photographs and other memorabilia from the Sisters' collection, as well as artifacts from crime in real life, is on view through Nov. 3.</p>
        <p>Sisters in Crime, with more than 3,000 members, was founded 10 years ago ''to combat discrimination against women in the mystery field . . . and to raise awareness of their contribution,'' according to its statement of purpose.</p>
        <p>Discrimination against women, in a genre that counts among its luminaries Agatha Christie and P(hyllis) D(orothy) James, Sue Grafton and Sara Paretsky, Patricia Cornwell and Edna Buchanan? Not to mention authors like Antonia Fraser, Joyce Carol Oates and Carolyn G. Heilbrun, who publish mysteries under pseudonyms.</p>
        <p>Too true, said, Annette Meyers, Douglass class of '55, who is a past president of Sisters in Crime. ''The discrimination comes in the way we are reviewed,'' she said. ''About 65 percent of the reviews are for male writers. We have a volunteer goup that monitors newspapers across the country and reports once a year, and actually, we're slipping a little.'' And male writers are still published in hardcover more often than women, she added.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, women buy more books than men do -- a fact that helped Ms. Meyers, who spent 16 years as a Wall Street headhunter, make a career change. ''By 1983, there was this huge surge in interest,'' she said. ''Women got tired of reading about male protagonists, and publishers, who are always anxious to make money, looked around for books with strong female protagonists.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Meyers, who grew up in Toms River and now lives in New York City, writes three series, one of which features a fictional Douglass alumna: Leslie Wetzon of the Smith &amp; Wetzon mysteries, whose heroines happen to be Wall Street headhunters. Three current New Jerseyans are on the ''Women With Attitude'' panel. Lee Harris of Tenafly created Christine Bennett, a 30-year-old ex-nun living in Westchester County, N.Y., who has been known to cross the Hudson in search of clues. Stefanie Matteson of Mendham sent her heroine, Charlotte Graham, a 72-year-old former movie actress, on a tour of Jersey diners and artists' studios in the Great Falls historic district of Paterson in ''Murder at the Falls.'' Nicole St. John of Bergen County, author of three-going-on-four mysteries for adults, has set several of her young-adult novels in Wycoff, Ridgewood and Ocean Grove. Another panelist, Janet Evanovich, a South River native and Douglass alumna who now lives in New Hampshire, sets her Stephanie Plum mysteries in Trenton.</p>
        <p>''I know all the authors,'' said the panel's moderator, Joyce Christmas of New York City. ''They're not full of attitude, but the array of detectives in their books is quite interesting: a former nun, a retired senior citizen actress, a tough black policewoman who's the widow of policeman, a lesbian private eye, a bounty hunter, executive headhunters and a British aristocrat who lives in New York. They're a pretty feisty bunch.''</p>
        <p>The discussion ''will probably deal with how the writers came up with those particular kinds of sleuths,'' Ms. Christmas said. ''They're not particularly aggressive themselves, but it's as if they're working out something in their minds.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Matteson added: ''Mystery writing requires some scientific turn of mind because it's a very structured, architectural type of writing.'' Aspiring perpetrators will have a chance to learn the mechanics at two daytime workshops.</p>
        <p>T HE Sisters in Crime archive was just boxes in the cellars, attics and garages of past presidents when Ms. Meyers joined the board in 1993 and was asked to find a home for it. ''I really think they they thought it would be a dirty job,'' she said. ''But the minute they said it, I knew where it should go.'' Her last official act as president of Sisters in Crime was to sign the agreement transferring the boxes to her alma mater.</p>
        <p>The collection includes ''everything from correspondence to videos of television programs based on books by the member authors,'' said Ferris Olin, the Douglass Library curator who serves as archivist. Now, part of the archive is on view in the exhibition ''Sisters in Crime: Fiction and Fact.''</p>
        <p>The fiction refers to the writers' work, the fact to true crimes involving New Jersey women. Display cases are devoted to famous cases like those of Mary Cole of Newton, who murdered her overbearing, interfering mother in 1812; Fanny Salisbury, an unwed mother from Newark who hanged herself in Newark in 1820, leaving her baby in a basket by her side, and Bridget Durgan, an Irish immigrant to New Brunswick who in 1867 killed her employer's wife after mistaking his politeness to her for love.</p>
        <p>Then there are ''The Great Trunk Mystery,'' in which the body of a Paterson woman, possibly killed by an abortionist, was found in a Chicago-bound trunk in 1871, and the Hall-Mills case in New Brunswick, in which an Episcopal minister and his choir-singing mistress were found shot and slashed to death in 1922.</p>
        <p>''We've been lucky'' in placing the archive, Ms. Meyers said. ''The deans have all been mystery fans.''</p>
        <p>It's a good thing, since Dean Barbara Shailor's official residence at 23 Nichol Avenue was once the home of the wandering Rev. Edward Wheeler Hall. ''And we have the evidence; we have the bullets and one of the knives,'' Ms. Olin said. ''It was quite an experience opening the evidence box. It really did give us the creeps.''</p>
        <p>But then, that's what mysteries are all about.</p>
