        <p>To Sunday Styles:</p>
        <p>Whenever a burned-out 1960's rock star publishes another pathetic memoir, why does The New York Times waste so much print on it (''Still a Rock 'n' Roll Mama,'' Oct. 18)?

        <p>To Sunday Styles:</p>
        <p>Whenever a burned-out 1960's rock star publishes another pathetic memoir, why does The New York Times waste so much print on it (''Still a Rock 'n' Roll Mama,'' Oct. 18)? I mean, here's Grace Slick, a rich girl who had fun as a fake hero of the revolution, pushing the tattered shreds of the ''renegade'' Slick shtick that can no longer conceal her self-absorbed pomposity.</p>
        <p>Like others who pushed drugs as portals to transcendence, she denies any responsibility for helping screw up the fools who took her as seriously as she takes herself, saying ''White Rabbit'' was ''misinterpreted.'' Right.</p>
        <p>Maybe I fail to appreciate the profound impact these music-industry products had, or maybe I overappreciate how those without rich daddies to fall back on permanently crippled their lives, because they took the opinions of synthetic pop-cult sages as seriously as The Times apparently does. But hey, half a page of this boring, predictable drivel? Please!</p>
