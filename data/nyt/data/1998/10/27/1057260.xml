        <p>GARSON-William Donald. 71, former director of corporate communications at Forbes Magazine, died on Sunday, October 25, at the Sarah R. Neumann Home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. due to complications from a stroke. A World War II Navy veteran and a graduate of Temple University, Don Garson was the son of William Roy and Anna Reilly Garson of Drexel Hill, PA. After a brief career as an actor, primarily in summer stock, he entered the newspaper advertising business with the now defunct New York Mirror, moving from there in 1963 to become head of promotion and research at The Saturday Review. In 1966 he joined Forbes Magazine as head of advertising promotion and research. He also handled public relations for both the magazine and its publisher, Malcolm Forbes. During his years at Forbes the magazine rose in prominence to become the number one publication in ad pages. He retired in 1992. Garson has been listed in Who's Who in Advertising, Who's Who in Finance and Industry and Who's Who in the World. A resident of the Edgemont area of Greenburgh, Westchester County, N.Y. since 1967, Garson was active in the Greenburgh Nature Center, serving as president of its Board of Directors in 1994 and 1995. He was also a member of the Greater Westchester Orchid Society and a past council member of the Greater Scarsdale United Way.
