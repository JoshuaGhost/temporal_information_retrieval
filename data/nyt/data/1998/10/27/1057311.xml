        <p>Milestone</p>
        <p>Alice Tully Hall is the answer. The question is: Where will the pianist Byron Janis celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut? Thursday is the night, and 7:30 is the time. But the real story here is one of perseverance. Mr. Janis, who turned 70 in March, has come back from psoriatic arthritis, which struck him in 1973 and eventually forced him to halt his concert career. His program will include works by Mozart, Schumann, Prokofiev, Albeniz, Wagner and Liszt, and the version of Chopin's ''Valse Brillante'' in E flat major that Mr. Janis discovered in 1973 at Yale University.</p>

        <p>Milestone</p>
        <p>Alice Tully Hall is the answer. The question is: Where will the pianist Byron Janis celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut? Thursday is the night, and 7:30 is the time. But the real story here is one of perseverance. Mr. Janis, who turned 70 in March, has come back from psoriatic arthritis, which struck him in 1973 and eventually forced him to halt his concert career. His program will include works by Mozart, Schumann, Prokofiev, Albeniz, Wagner and Liszt, and the version of Chopin's ''Valse Brillante'' in E flat major that Mr. Janis discovered in 1973 at Yale University.</p>
        <p>Flipped Lid</p>
        <p>The music was classical but the piano was contemporary when Martha Argerich appeared as soloist with the Montreal Symphony, led by Charles Dutoit, at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon (reviewed above). The music, just before intermission, was the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 in E flat. The piano, wheeled onstage for this piece, was a Steinway with a difference -- two lids. The second lid, hanging underneath, was intended to throw sound forward, enriching the music. The device, invented by Daniel Revenaugh, was being used for the first time by a Carnegie Hall artist. When Ms. Argerich finished playing, the audience called for more. On this day, there was no encore.</p>
        <p>Souvenirs</p>
        <p>Love's magic (and evanescent) spell is on the auction block this week in Paris. The lovers were Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar, a mistress and muse, who was dropped in 1944 after nine years for a younger woman, Francoise Gilot. Ms. Maar, a Surrealist photographer, died last year at 89, leaving one of the last great Picasso collections outside the hands of his immediate family. It includes 10 paintings, seven of them portraits of Ms. Maar, including the four ''Weeping Woman'' oils for which she modeled and 50 drawings, including the colorful, erotic ''Dora Maar and the Minotaur.'' ''The Picassos of Dora Maar'' auction begins today and continues through Thursday at the Maison de la Chimie in Paris.</p>
        <p>Master of Beauty</p>
        <p>The figures, precisely rendered, have a porcelainlike quality. Draped in shimmering silks, seen in otherworldly nocturnal lighting, they seem in balletic motion, their gestures emphasized dramatically. Welcome to the world of Donato Creti, who descended into obscurity soon after his death in 1749,  perhaps because his conception of idealized beauty set him apart from other artists. Today through Jan. 31, the Metropolitan Museum of Art will pay homage to this major figure of 18th-century Italian painting with an exhibition called ''Donato Creti: Melancholy and Perfection,'' comprising his masterpiece, a cycle of 17 mythological and allegorical paintings created between 1713 and 1721 and seen for the first time outside his native Bologna.</p>
