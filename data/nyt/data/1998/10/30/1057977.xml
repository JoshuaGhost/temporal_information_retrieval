        <p>THE STORY OF AMERICAN FREEDOM  By Eric Foner  Illustrated. 422 pages. W. W. Norton. $27.95.</p>
        <p>In 1792, fearing the emergence of a monarchical Presidency, Congress directed that the new American nation's first coins display not the head of the President but ''an impression emblematic of liberty, with an inscription of the word Liberty'' stamped upon them. A decade later, when Thomas Jefferson effected the Louisiana Purchase, he referred to the enlarged country as ''the Empire of Liberty.'' And three generations after that, at the height of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said of both sides: ''We all declare for Liberty, but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Freedom has always been the American religion, but, as Lincoln said, the concept has meant different things at different times to different groups. The competing definitions are closely described in this new book by Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian. ''The Story of American Freedom'' is a retelling of American history, from the Revolutionary War to the Reagan revolution, organized around the concept of freedom, its meaning and how that meaning has been manipulated, argued and transformed.</p>
        <p>The history of freedom, Mr. Foner writes, is ''a tale of debates, disagreements and struggles rather than a set of timeless categories or an evolutionary narrative toward a preordained goal.''</p>
        <p>That statement is no doubt true and also worth remembering as one reads Mr. Foner's well-informed and scrupulously balanced book. And yet, there is something dutiful rather than inspired about Mr. Foner's writing and his approach, which, despite the author's claim to have taken a fresh look at American history, comes across as a bit familiar. It seems rather obvious, for example, that a history including the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and the denial, until after World War I, of the vote to women, never reflected liberty as an immutable principle. Despite that, and despite a certain blandness in the writing -- freedom as a matter of ''divergent connotations and applications,'' for example -- and despite the abstractness of his approach, Mr. Foner has written an instructive book on the spirit of American political life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foner examines each major period of American history, isolating the concept of freedom that prevailed at the time, demonstrating how the concept was either challenged or reinforced. He treats the Revolutionary War, for example, as a seminal episode that did far more than simply win independence for the colonies and create a nonmonarchical republic. The roots of American freedom lay in the former mother country, but ''its emergence as a new and distinct ideology grew out of the struggle for independence and the creation of a nation-state that defined itself, in James Madison's words, as the 'workshop of liberty to the Civilized World.' ''</p>
        <p>The great national hypocrisy was slavery and, after slavery, the institutionalized racism that persisted until after the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Foner shows what seems extraordinary now, that the debate over slavery was to a degree a contest between alternate concepts of freedom, one stressing the rights of all to be free and the other the supposed normal hierarchy of human society in which some were naturally subordinate to others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foner's examples of the effect that slavery had on American practices and vocabulary are among the book's most fascinating passages. ''The contrast between liberty and slavery provided a rhetoric through which those outside the boundaries of American freedom could challenge their exclusion and, in so doing, transform the meaning of freedom itself.'' Just as, in Mr. Foner's interpretation, the Revolution established freedom as the national ideology, the Union's victory in the Civil War ''consolidated the northern understanding of freedom as the national norm.''</p>
        <p>The Civil War also fostered the image of a powerful Government as the ultimate guarantor of freedom, and this suggests a tension in American history as old as the nation, the tension between governmental power as a threat and as the guardian of the oppressed. Subsequent national debates over the concentration of capital, for example, echoed the earlier competing conceptions of freedom, whether it meant unrestricted economic activity or something close to its opposite, controls on private property to prevent the economic enslavement of labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foner traces the development of the concept of civil liberties to court cases involving free speech early in this century. He argues that the New Deal finally recognized economic security as ''a political condition of personal freedom.'' In the postwar world, Mr. Foner argues, freedom became associated with material prosperity, an association made clear in Richard Nixon's famous ''kitchen debate'' with the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev.  ''In the 1950's,'' Mr. Foner writes, ''freedom became fully identified with consumer capitalism, or, as it was now universally known, 'free enterprise.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foner ends on a note of description rather than analysis. He shows how freedom was, in his view, expanded by the cultural revolution of the 1960's, but also how a different concept of freedom -- based, again, on economic freedom and the fear of big Government -- came to prevail when Ronald Reagan become President. The two final chapters, in which Mr. Foner covers this ground, are rapid-fire summaries of recent American history, from the 60's notion of freedom as an erotically charged challenge to authority to the Reagan-era concept of freedom based on smaller government and free enterprise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foner is nothing if not comprehensive here, as in the rest of his book, but these final chapters, which involve violently contested visions of American freedom, seem strangely bloodless as well as familiar. Reading ''The Story of American Freedom,'' one is grateful for Mr. Foner's clarity and knowledgeability, even while wishing that he had been conceptually bolder and more outspoken about his passions and less dutifully respectful of so many points of view, including those he clearly does not agree with.</p>
