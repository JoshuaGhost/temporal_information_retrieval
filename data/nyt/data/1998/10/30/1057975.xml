        <p>Wednesday night's concert at Alice Tully Hall was given by Jordi Savall and his big band: the players on viols, guitar, percussion, assorted wind instruments and keyboards of his group Hesperion XX together with the six singers of his La Capella Reial de Catalunya. And they kicked up quite a storm.</p>
        <p>Nominally the program was devoted to Spanish music during the time of Philip II, who died 400 years ago, but there were pieces from well before this solemn monarch was born -- from the era when his great-grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabella, were reconquering Granada from the Moors -- and there were others that spilled over well into the 17th century. Historical boundaries were not too important. This was music being made now, music that took off from incomplete sources and was projected with great vim and polish.</p>

        <p>Wednesday night's concert at Alice Tully Hall was given by Jordi Savall and his big band: the players on viols, guitar, percussion, assorted wind instruments and keyboards of his group Hesperion XX together with the six singers of his La Capella Reial de Catalunya. And they kicked up quite a storm.</p>
        <p>Nominally the program was devoted to Spanish music during the time of Philip II, who died 400 years ago, but there were pieces from well before this solemn monarch was born -- from the era when his great-grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabella, were reconquering Granada from the Moors -- and there were others that spilled over well into the 17th century. Historical boundaries were not too important. This was music being made now, music that took off from incomplete sources and was projected with great vim and polish.</p>
        <p>Different blendings of voices and instruments were used with cheerful exuberance. A piece by Bartomeu Carceres became a Christmas rap song, with the singers taking turns at the verses, separated by instrumental solos that suggested that jazz was born in 16th-century Madrid. Probably flamenco started there too, for a couple of numbers had strong syncopations endorsed by Pedro Estevan on castanets.</p>
        <p>Often the players would partly improvise, as it seemed, a segue. In the case of Francisco Correa de Arrauxo's hymn honoring the Immaculate Conception, the instrumental meditation, led by Mr. Savall on a small viol, was considerably longer than the original music, and none the worse for that.</p>
        <p>Other crucial performers included the soprano Montserrat Figueras, whose voice sounds like a sideways seductive smile, and Carlos Mena, a confident countertenor. Performances mattered more than repertory, but a few pieces stood out, notably a suavely somber madrigal by Francisco Guerrero, the major composer who was almost exactly Philip's contemporary, and a song by Juan del Enzina from soon after the victory in Granada.</p>
        <p>This piece could teach us something in terms of its sympathy for an ethnic-religious enemy. It is a lament placed in the mouth of the last King of Granada and pays respect to the Moorish culture, which surely contributed to its haunting melody. It is a small musical equivalent of the tiled courtyards and dribbling fountains of the Real Alcazar in Seville.</p>
