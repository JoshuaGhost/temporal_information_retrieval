        <p>Investigators looking into the crash last month of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ''heat damage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system, prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo jets, Swissair officials said today.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a statement that there was not enough information to determine whether the heat damage was a possible source of the smoke that the pilots reported in the cockpit shortly before the crash, or whether it was ''merely the byproduct of other events.''</p>

        <p>Investigators looking into the crash last month of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ''heat damage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system, prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo jets, Swissair officials said today.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a statement that there was not enough information to determine whether the heat damage was a possible source of the smoke that the pilots reported in the cockpit shortly before the crash, or whether it was ''merely the byproduct of other events.''</p>
        <p>One aviation safety official called it ''a circumstantial clue.''</p>
        <p>The entertainment system installed by Swissair is apparently not used by any other airline, although the Federal Aviation Administration -- which approved the installation for Swissair -- said that if it found an airline using the same equipment, it would ask that the system be turned off.</p>
        <p>The system is installed on the first-class and business-class seats of Swissair's 15 surviving MD-11's and its three 747's. It includes a video screen that unfolds from the armrest like a tray table and can be used by a passenger to watch a variety of movies or play casino-style games.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the airline, Jackie Pash, stressed that investigators had not determine what role, if any, the system played in the crash. ''People are going to immediately think this is a cause of 111, and that has not been determined at all,'' she said. ''Swissair is interested in taking any precautionary measures, as you can imagine.''</p>
        <p>About 70 percent of the plane has been recovered, and work is continuing to find more of it.</p>
        <p>From the parts that have been recovered, investigators have found that much of the heat damage is concentrated in an area above the ceiling, over the wall that divides the cockpit from the first-class cabin.</p>
        <p>Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board, said that the forward area, the area that is of the greatest interest to investigators, is also the most badly shattered, apparently having hit first. The investigators recently identified wiring from the entertainment system as being heat-damaged and coming from that area over the wall.</p>
        <p>The plane crashed on Sept. 2, on a flight from Kennedy International Airport to Switzerland, killing all 229 people aboard. The pilots had reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash. Investigators have avoided using the word ''fire,'' saying instead that components are heat-damaged.</p>
        <p>The system was designed and manufactured by Interactive Flight Technologies of Phoenix, a company that subsequently got out of the business because it could not make additional sales. A spokeswoman, Marsha Malone, said today that she could not give any information about the system installed on the Swissair planes.</p>
        <p>Les Dorr, a spokesman for the F.A.A., said his agency had inspected one Swissair MD-11, concentrating on the wiring in the forward part of the plane, including the entertainment system, and that Swissair itself had inspected three more that were undergoing maintenance. No safety problems were found on any of the planes, he said. He added that the inspections were ''in areas that were readily accessible, where we didn't have to take anything apart.''</p>
        <p>He said that the F.A.A. was re-examining the design and installation of the system on the Swissair planes, but that the agency had not asked any other airlines to inspect their entertainment systems.</p>
        <p>Such systems are a major point of competition among airlines offering first-class or business-class service over long routes. They can require large amounts of electric current, and thus generate substantial heat.</p>
