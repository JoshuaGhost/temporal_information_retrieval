        <p>It being Halloween, let us salute Winnie Judd, trunk murderess. She died the other day in Phoenix, age 93. The Times obituary laid her out in grand style, with a full account of her 15 minutes of grisly fame back in long-ago 1931.</p>
        <p>Arriving in Los Angeles by train from Phoenix, she had two trunks unloaded, one of which, an observant porter told the law, seemed to be bleeding.</p>
        <p>Examination disclosed one trunk packed with the complete body of a 32-year-old woman; the other, with the body of a 24-year-old woman ''neatly cut into three pieces,'' the Times obituary explained, ''to make it easier to pack.''</p>
        <p>You can tell this was back in the Stone Age. Americans not only traveled by train, they also carried heavy luggage with them. Nowadays Mrs. Judd would ship everything by U.P.S.</p>
        <p>The details of the trial are humdrum. Winnie, as the tabloids called her, claimed self-defense; the prosecution called it a cold-blooded act of murderous jealousy.</p>
        <p>Convicted, she was sentenced to be hanged, then excused from the gallows on grounds of insanity. After seven escapes from mental institutions, she was set free in 1971.</p>
        <p>Nobody during her trial seems to have been terribly curious about who had performed the dismembering work, though it was said to be of professional quality beyond Mrs. Judd's skills.</p>
        <p>Crime has declined since Mrs. Judd's day. The murders that fascinated the tabloids, and much of the nation, during the 1930's and 40's had a more amateurish, homespun quality than we are now accustomed to.</p>
        <p>Murder nowadays seems like an industrial production as savage as a corporate downsizing. Killers for international drug cartels wipe out entire families -- men, women, children -- on orders from above.</p>
        <p>Organized mobs use professional hit men who dispose of the results of their skills by having them ground up in industrial machinery and used for highway paving.</p>
        <p>Modern murders rarely rate more than two days in the news before being shrugged off by the public. We are stuffed by a steady diet of murder as both news and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Compared with our industrial-style murderers, killers of the Prohibition and Depression years were mom-and-pop operators. The small-scale human messes they made kept the public fascinated.</p>
        <p>Their murders were rich with the human-interest angles that are catnip for the press.</p>
        <p>The Lindbergh kidnap-murder case of the 1930's may have been the century's most absorbing crime story. The country was absorbed in it from the moment Americans learned that Lindbergh's son had been stolen to the night Bruno Richard Hauptmann went to the electric chair.</p>
        <p>Hauptmann was the quintessential mom-and-pop criminal, a working stiff desperate for money. He still has defenders who argue that he was unfairly convicted.</p>
        <p>Histories of the age between the world wars are full of bungled mom-and-pop murders that made it a golden age for the tabloids.</p>
        <p>One of the juicier was the Hall-Mills case of the 1920's. The dead were a society clergyman and a lady of the choir. The trial featured a female farmer whose work among barnyard animals led the tabloids to christen her ''the pig woman.'' The papers kept the story alive for five years, but no one was ever convicted.</p>
        <p>Despite Prohibition violence, industrial-scale murder was so rare that the entire country was shocked in 1929 when Al Capone's thugs killed seven of ''Bugs'' Moran's men in a Chicago garage.</p>
        <p>It was considered such a prodigiously monstrous act that it became famous across the country as ''the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.'' Seven wouldn't be a very impressive score for today's drug-industry killers.</p>
        <p>Winnie Judd's attempt to pull off a double murder seems ridiculously amateurish today. Americans have no patience with amateurs anymore.</p>
        <p>The day when a weekend athlete put on a cheap pair of U.S. Keds sneakers and some old corduroy pants to play tennis with a Sears Roebuck racket are as gone as train travel with trunks.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the sorriest weekend athlete in the land would rather die than be less correctly dressed, less expensively equipped with sport gear than Tiger Woods or Pete Sampras.</p>
        <p>Winnie, using her silly trunks instead of state-of-the-art road-paving machinery, now seems an amateurish embarrassment to American murder.</p>
