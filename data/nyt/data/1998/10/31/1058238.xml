        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 26 editorial ''Violence Against Abortion Doctors'' assumes, without proof, that Dr. Barnett A. Slepian was killed by an ''anti-choice fanatic.'' Most likely, the crime was indeed committed by a person opposed to abortion, but it is wrong to blame the pro-life movement for the violent act of one person. Is the environmental movement responsible for the acts of the Unabomber?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 26 editorial ''Violence Against Abortion Doctors'' assumes, without proof, that Dr. Barnett A. Slepian was killed by an ''anti-choice fanatic.'' Most likely, the crime was indeed committed by a person opposed to abortion, but it is wrong to blame the pro-life movement for the violent act of one person. Is the environmental movement responsible for the acts of the Unabomber?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the killer was driven to desperation by the rigid refusal of the pro-choice advocates to give an inch on such issues as a ban on partial-birth abortions, waiting periods and parental notification -- despite the fact that these limitations are supported by a wide majority of Americans.</p>
        <p>Those of us who are genuinely pro-life are saddened by Dr. Slepian's death. By all accounts, he was a decent man with whom we disagreed.</p>
        <p>Strategically, his death is a catastrophe for the pro-life movement because it distracts from our message and galvanizes pro-abortion activists. If the killer thought he could stop abortion by stopping Dr. Slepian, he is not only violent, he is stupid.</p>
