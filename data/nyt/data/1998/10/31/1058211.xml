        <p>As the fiercely contested Senate race entered its final weekend, Representative Charles E. Schumer campaigned across Queens and Brooklyn with President Clinton yesterday, appearing before elderly groups, Jewish Democrats and black ministers in communities where a strong Democratic turnout is essential for Mr. Schumer to win.</p>
        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican running for his fourth term, yesterday brought out his own big-name supporter, Jack Kemp, the former Congressman and Vice-Presidential candidate, as he also sought to energize his core Republican supporters in a visit to Buffalo. Later, Mr. D'Amato joined Gov. George E. Pataki in the final leg of their four-day tour of New York, with events in Watertown, Plattsburgh and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>In a series of appearances that were largely devoid of partisan oratory, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Schumer, a nine-term Democrat from Brooklyn, as having ''the ability to turn ideals into action,'' and urged his audiences to go to the polls on Tuesday for what he called ''an extraordinary election.''</p>
        <p>''I can tell you that, especially for New York, to have somebody like Chuck Schumer in the United States Senate, someone who could serve in the tradition of the greatest New York senators, and the greatest senators of this country, would be a great gift to this country,'' Mr. Clinton told a group of Jewish contributors at a fund-raiser near the Flatbush neighborhood where Mr. Schumer grew up.</p>
        <p>This political season, Mr. Clinton has attended mostly fund-raisers and very few rallies for candidates, in part to shield the candidates from any association with the Lewinsky scandal.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Clinton's visit, his second on behalf of Mr. Schumer this year, Mr. D'Amato was shifting gears in his upstate swing yesterday, largely dropping the issue that has been the centerpiece of his campaign for the last month: Mr. Schumer's numerous missed votes in Congress this year.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Kemp returned to a bedrock Republican theme, criticizing Mr. Schumer for voting to increase an array of taxes, including on gasoline and Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>''If you're under-taxed, I invite you to vote for Chuck Schumer,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''If you're under-taxed, don't vote for D'Amato. You'll be disappointed. He is not going to Washington to return to the United States Senate to raise taxes.''</p>
        <p>To those in the Schumer camp, Mr. D'Amato's decision to drop the missed-vote refrain was clear evidence that they had successfully blunted the issue by releasing documents showing that Mr. D'Amato, as Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead Town, on Long Island, missed hundreds of votes in 1980 when he ran for the Senate the first time.</p>
        <p>''It shows that he has finally abandoned the fraudulent issue, having been confronted by the fact that he missed more votes in 12 months than Chuck Schumer did in 18 years,'' said Howard Wolfson, Mr. Schumer's spokesman.</p>
        <p>Asked why he had virtually dropped the subject of missed votes yesterday, Mr. D'Amato replied, ''I think I focused on something that is rather important.''</p>
        <p>But having shifted away from that theme, the D'Amato campaign continued on the new line of attack that it unveiled on Thursday, flooding the airwaves again yesterday with an advertisement that invokes a 1980 investigation into Mr. Schumer. The investigation was dropped, but the D'Amato camp contends that the spot undermines Mr. Schumer's efforts to cast himself as trustworthy and ethical.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's foray into Brooklyn and Queens underscored again the New York race's importance to the White House, which is concerned that the Republicans could gain a 60-vote majority, enough to block Democratic filibusters, on Election Day. The Republicans hold a 55-to-45-seat advantage now.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to campaign with Mr. Schumer on Sunday. Hillary Rodham Clinton has already appeared with the Congressman three times since he won the Democratic primary in September.</p>
        <p>Although there has been a furious debate among political strategists over whether Mr. Clinton will help or hurt Democrats on Election Day, Mr. Schumer's advisers firmly believe that the President -- and particularly the President's policies -- are so popular in New York that his presence can only encourage voters to turn out on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>At each of his appearances, Mr. Clinton focused heavily on policy, promoting his plans to protect the Social Security system at a senior center in Woodside, Queens; his role in bringing about a Middle East peace accord to Jewish contributors in Brooklyn, and his proposal to build 5,000 new schools before black ministers and politicians in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>Although some Democratic strategists contend that public weariness with investigations into the President's life could help Democratic candidates on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton did not directly address his problems stemming from the Lewinsky affair. But at each stop, he made passing reference to his problems with the Republican leadership in Congress.</p>
        <p>''In the last year, I was deeply frustrated at all the things I tried to do that we couldn't do because of the increasing partisanship of the other party in Washington,'' Mr. Clinton said at the Flatbush fund-raiser. ''To have a few more Democrats like Chuck Schumer may mean the difference in whether we save Social Security or forget about our obligations to our parents and our children.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer voted against opening impeachment proceedings against Mr. Clinton, saying the President should suffer some lesser form of punishment, perhaps censure. Mr. D'Amato, whose aides acknowledge that Mr. Clinton continues to have strong approval ratings in the state, has been silent about what should happen to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Schumer was not shy about wrapping himself in the President's mantle. ''I'm happy to tell you I stood with this man on issue after issue after issue,'' he said at the St. Sebastian's Parish Center in Woodside, a heavily Irish, Democratic neighborhood that has supported both Mr. Clinton and Mr. D'Amato in past elections.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's tour with Mr. Clinton was the first time in days that Mr. Schumer had campaigned before sizable crowds -- between 100 and 200 people at each of his events. Throughout the week, when Mr. D'Amato had been repeatedly appearing before groups of 300 or more people, the Senator's supporters had contended that the Democrat was not well known or popular enough to draw a crowd.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Schumer's event in Flatbush, the police closed off roads throughout the area for more than an hour late in the afternoon, clogging traffic just as many Orthodox Jews in the neighborhood were rushing home for the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>''I was stunned he would pick a Friday afternoon to come here,'' said Len Gams, a resident, who said it took him an additional hour and a half to make his commute home. ''Luckily I made it to synagogue 10 minutes before sundown.''</p>
        <p>In his upstate tour with Mr. Pataki and Mary Donohue, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Mr. D'Amato attacked Mr. Schumer for voting in 1993 for Mr. Clinton's plan to close the budget deficit, a plan that included raising taxes.</p>
        <p>''It was the Congressman who said by raising taxes he would help the economy,'' Mr. D'Amato said in a news event at Buffalo International Airport. ''I don't know what economy he's talking about. Did you ever hear of raising taxes to create jobs? It doesn't work.''</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Schumer drew close to the President, Mr. D'Amato tried to draw some warmth from Mr. Pataki's high ratings in the polls. ''Support this great team led by Governor Pataki, and don't forget Al D'Amato,'' he said in Watertown.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato also got an infusion of support from the National Rifle Association, which announced yesterday that it was spending $160,000 to send fliers to more than half a million homes warning that Mr. Schumer, a leading advocate of gun control, would try to outlaw guns if elected.</p>
        <p>The mailing features a fake newspaper article bearing the headline ''Schumer elected to U.S. Senate; gun ban, confiscation law likely to pass.''</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato is a steadfast opponent of gun control, and Mr. Schumer has used the issue to contrast his record with the Senator's, calling it evidence that Mr. D'Amato is beholden to the N.R.A. and is an extreme conservative.</p>
        <p>A consensus of polls have shown that the Senate race is extremely close, and for that reason a State Supreme Court justice took the unusual step yesterday of ordering that paper ballots in Tuesday's election be impounded. The order by the justice, James Yates, was the result of a joint request by the state Republican and Democratic Parties, which are concerned about getting accurate counts from absentee and other paper ballots.</p>
        <p>Although it is typical for paper ballots to be locked away after Election Day, it is unusual for a judge to order them to be impounded days before the election. The paper ballots will not be opened until Nov. 9.</p>
