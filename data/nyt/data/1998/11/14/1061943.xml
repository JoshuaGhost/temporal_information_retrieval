      <abstract>
        <p>Letter by Denis Johnston of American Friends Service Committee says Immigration and Naturalization Service should allow immigrants from hurricane-devastated areas in Central America to return there temporarily without jeopardizing their ability to become permanent US residents (Nov 12 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Many immigrants from the hurricane-affected areas in Central America cannot travel to their native countries because of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's practice of denying permission to temporarily leave the country (front page, Nov. 12). This temporary permission would allow the immigrants to return without jeopardizing their ability to become permanent residents.</p>
        <p>Immigrants who arrived in this country in the mid-1980's have waited an average of 10 to 11 years to have their cases adjudicated by the immigration service.</p>

        <p>''I would tell everyone to stay firm and try to communicate through telephone, letters, Internet, any other means possible until they adjust their status,'' you quote an unnamed I.N.S. official as saying. After a decade of waiting, I wonder how much longer this community should ''stay firm''?</p>
