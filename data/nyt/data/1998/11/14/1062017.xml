        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Diane Nottle's Oct. 12 cover article on sister cities was of special interest to members of the Montclair-Pearl Lagoon Sister City Project. Pearl Lagoon, called Laguna de Perlas in the western, Spanish-speaking regions of Nicaragua, is on the Atlantic-Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, where most people are of African and indigenous ancestry and speak English.</p>
        <p>Montclair is in many ways dissimilar to Pearl Lagoon, where there are no paved streets, electric power is on four or five hours a day and fishing in the lagoon is the main means of survival. However, it is the empathy of sharing human ideals and the sharing of common family concerns that have sustained friendships and enriched the lives of people in both communities.</p>
