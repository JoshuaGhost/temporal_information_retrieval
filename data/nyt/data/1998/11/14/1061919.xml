        <p>The post-election consensus that Republicans need a nicer smile and a softer touch has left Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan feeling a little bit discriminated against in the race against three women for a lower-level House leadership position.</p>

        <p>The post-election consensus that Republicans need a nicer smile and a softer touch has left Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan feeling a little bit discriminated against in the race against three women for a lower-level House leadership position.</p>
        <p>''I do hear it from some members, that you've got to have a certain mix,'' a certain diversity in the lineup, Mr. Hoekstra said, and added that the real question of fitness for the relatively obscure post was ''a performance issue.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans: party of quotas and affirmative action?</p>
        <p>Maybe not, but Congressional Republicans do seem to have got the idea that the many female voters who have been snubbing them at the polls might enjoy seeing more women in prominent positions.</p>
        <p>A record five women are in leadership races in the House, where Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington, who is running for majority leader, is the first woman in either party to pursue a top leadership job.</p>
        <p>All the other women are in races near the bottom of the leadership ladder, running for posts that have been held by women in the past -- in the view of some, as a way to put women in the leadership team photo without giving them much to do.</p>
        <p>But the women competing for leadership positions clearly do see their sex as a selling point. Right after they say that their being women is wholly irrelevant, they talk about why being women makes them better at listening, communicating and working well with others -- all areas in which there is general agreement that their party could use some work.</p>
        <p>Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina, one of three women competing for Ms. Dunn's old job as vice chairwoman of the House Republican conference, essentially a spokesman's position and well down the ladder of leadership posts, put it like this: ''I think there are a lot of us that feel we bring a special -- let's not say special -- a different way of working.''</p>
        <p>Being in Congress, said Ms. Myrick, former Mayor of Charlotte, ''is like raising your kids.''</p>
        <p>''You're always trying to get people to get along. And males don't always . . . '' she said, trailing off for a moment. ''Well, we tend to be less confrontational.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dunn, too, boasts of extra prowess as a result of her sex. ''Just little things that come from listening well and finding out where the soft spots are, women are very good at that. And many men are, too,'' said Ms. Dunn, a former party worker in her home state, nodding to the overwhelming majority of voters in the upcoming House leadership elections who are, after all, male.</p>
        <p>Representative Tillie Fowler of Florida, who is also running for the vice chairwoman's job, said, ''We're better at balancing because we've had to be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fowler, a lawyer elected to Congress after serving on the Jacksonville City Council, called herself a ''good coalition builder.'' And she showed what might be considered a traditionally female sense of collegiality, saying: ''My opponents are good, too. We'll have a good strong team no matter who gets elected.''</p>
        <p>The other female candidate for the vice chairwoman's post, Representative Anne M. Northup of Kentucky, a former state legislator, said nothing about being a woman but talked up her ability to help broaden the party's appeal to minorities. In the recent election, she boasted in a letter to colleagues, she increased her share of black voters to 18 percent, from 11 percent in 1996, and promised to help do the same for the party.</p>
        <p>When asked whether that 18 percent left rather a lot of room for improvement, she showed that non-confrontational consensus builders can be snappish too.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' she said, ''but I doubled it, and 50 percent is half, and for a traditional voting bloc that's so significantly tied to one party, that's a lot of progress in two years.''</p>
        <p>(Ms. Northup does have some relevant experience; two of her six children are black, adopted by her and her husband. ''We've probably had every conversation around our table that you can have,'' she said.)</p>
        <p>Barbara Sinclair, a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles who teaches courses on Congress and women in American politics, notes that women have held various low-level posts since the 60's without ever moving up the ladder.</p>
        <p>Professor Sinclair said the historical record of women in Congressional leadership was so scant that ''it's a good sign just that Jennifer Dunn is running and people aren't laughing at her.''</p>
        <p>Way down the ticket, Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio is keeping her job as conference secretary. And the race between Ms. Myrick, Ms. Fowler, Ms. Northup and Mr. Hoekstra is so eclipsed by other races that simply asking members, ''What do you hear about the vice chair's race?'' is good for a laugh.</p>
        <p>Still, if Ms. Dunn succeeds, the post may come to be considered a good launching pad. And former Representative Susan Molinari of New York, who preceded Ms. Dunn in that job, said any leadership position was important because it came with a seat at the meetings where all the important decisions were made.</p>
        <p>''If you're at the table, you can foresee a problem coming,'' Ms. Molinari said, recalling how, because she was in a leadership meeting, she was able to extract from a pending bill an amendment barring single people from adopting. ''I could throw out there, while Newt's at the table, 'Is this really the message we want to send?' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Molinari said the problem of women climbing the leadership ladder in this particular Congress might have more to do with ideology than sex. ''The women tend to be moderate and pro-choice,'' she said, ''so in a conservative, pro-life conference, that becomes somewhat difficult.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dunn has a mixed voting record on abortion-rights issues and for that reason is regarded with some suspicion by some in the conference. Ms. Northup and Ms. Myrick oppose abortion rights, while Ms. Fowler supports abortion rights but voted to ban certain late-term abortions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Molinari and others said the position of women in the House had changed significantly in recent years. ''It used to be that none of us wanted to be seen as women's candidates'' or as particularly involved in issues considered women's issues, she said. ''But politics has changed so much that now men want to be the women's candidate. They're asking, 'Can I get time to speak about breast cancer?' ''</p>
        <p>One group that is not necessarily ready to applaud diversity in the Republican leadership team is the Democratic caucus. Some feel a little embarrassed that Republican leadership could include several women and a black man, Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, who is running against Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio as conference chairman -- while Democrats seem prepared to choose five white males.</p>
        <p>Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut is considered an underdog in the Democratic race for caucus chairman against Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who raised money for House races as head of the Democratic Congressional Conference Committee and has enjoyed a share of the credit for the November elections.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeLauro, too, was talking up her resume as a legislator, a leader  -- and a woman.</p>
        <p>''Women deal with consensus,'' she said. ''It's important that the Democratic leadership reflect the caucus -- and the people that elected us.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 10, 1998, Thursday  An article Nov. 14 about Representative J. C. Watts Jr. misstated the name of Mr. Watts's Democratic opponent in Oklahoma. He was Ben Odom, not Bruce Ober.</p>
