        <p>News analysis: United States is taking two gambles in providing $5 billion of the nearly $42 billion international bailout package proposed for Brazil; one is that it is a safe investment of US taxpayer money in a country in need of rapid reform; other is that the new US strategy to calm global financial jitters will succeed where others failed; until now, US and International Monetary Fund have stepped in to help countries only after they were in full economic arrest (M)</p>

        <p>With the announcement today of nearly $42 billion in aid to stabilize Brazil, the United States is taking two gambles: that its own part of the aid -- $5 billion in taxpayer money -- is a safe investment in a country in need of rapid reform, and a separate wager that its new strategy to calm the global financial jitters will succeed where others failed.</p>
        <p>Neither one is a sure bet.</p>

        <p>With the announcement today of nearly $42 billion in aid to stabilize Brazil, the United States is taking two gambles: that its own part of the aid -- $5 billion in taxpayer money -- is a safe investment in a country in need of rapid reform, and a separate wager that its new strategy to calm the global financial jitters will succeed where others failed.</p>
        <p>Neither one is a sure bet.</p>
        <p>When the United States committed $12 billion to Mexico in 1995, it compelled the Mexican Government to offer up collateral. Virtually all Mexico's oil revenues were deposited through the New York Federal Reserve Bank, until the loan was paid back. Brazil is offering nothing but its word, and the assurance, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said at the White House today, that it ''still has $40 billion in reserves.''</p>
        <p>The bigger risk, though, is a strategic one. Until now, the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury have stepped in to help countries only after they were in full economic arrest, out of money and on the brink of default.</p>
        <p>Together, the I.M.F. and the Treasury slowly doled out money, one payment at a time, as the South Koreans, the Thais, the Indonesians and finally the Russians imposed austerity measures and met a tough regime of economic goals.</p>
        <p>Now South Korea and Thailand are stable, but trapped in deep recessions. Indonesia and Russia are still falling like stones, their political chaos worsened by economic collapse, which in turn, provokes deeper political troubles.</p>
        <p>Brazil is a totally different case, the Administration says, deserving of the new approach first outlined by President Clinton last month to head off financial crises early, before they overwhelm countries and spread elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Brazil's problems are only partly of its own making. Investors fled after Russia's troubles caused convulsions in emerging markets around the world. The solution offered today was a ''precautionary'' aid program, and the Brazilians will have access to more than half of the $42 billion in the next few months, as long as they are moving toward the reforms they have promised.</p>
        <p>The strategy is to convince private investors around the world that the Brazilian Government has both the will to reform and the cash to fight off speculators and nervous bankers.</p>
        <p>''This is a totally noncomparable situation to what happened in Russia,'' Mr. Rubin insisted today, referring to a country that embraced I.M.F. reforms for all of three weeks in August, until the currency was devalued, Parliament refused to pass an austerity plan, and President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed the reformers who had negotiated the bailout deal.</p>
        <p>''While there are no certainties,'' Mr. Rubin said, ''we believe that this is the right program both for the people of Brazil and for the economic well-being of the American people.''</p>
        <p>If there is a lesson from the last four bailout efforts, though, it is that the best-negotiated plans can run afoul of domestic politics and unpredictable economic winds. And the plan for Brazil is fraught with similar risks.</p>
        <p>The first and smallest risk is that the Brazilians will not be able to pay back its lenders -- the I.M.F., the World Bank, and the 20 countries that have contributed to the bailout, led by the United States.</p>
        <p>The $40 billion in currency reserves still sitting in Brazil's central bank reduce that risk in just the way a bank is more comfortable lending to someone with money in the bank than someone without. But in the last few months Brazil saw $30 billion in reserves washed away, as it tried to defend its currency. If its reserves were a real solution, it would not need to borrow money in the first place.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rubin knows that his best protection is political. The United States is Brazil's biggest trading partner and the architect of the bailout plan. And one of the unspoken rules of the financial markets is that powerful creditors get paid back first -- because the borrower may need them again.</p>
        <p>The second risk is that the plan Brazil agreed to today could stabilize its currency, but worsen its recession. ''The biggest reason why this is a huge gamble is that we are knowingly sending Brazil into recession,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist who has emerged as one of the I.M.F.'s harshest critics.</p>
        <p>The cutbacks in government spending, the high interest rates to defend the currency and Brazil's refusal to devalue that currency -- which would make its exports less expensive -- ''show that the policy has not responded to a year in which we've discovered the downside of I.M.F. bailouts,'' Mr. Sachs insists.</p>
        <p>The fund said today that it had learned plenty. Its plans for Brazil, it insists, include the preservation of crucial programs to help the poor. And it is already pressing private banks to keep open their lines of credit to Brazil, rather than to use the bailout to get their money out of the country.</p>
        <p>''Every effort has been made to spare basic social programs from the expenditure cuts that fiscal discipline requires,'' Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the I.M.F., said today.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest risk is that the plan will take the pressure off the Brazilian Congress to act. For while the United States and the I.M.F. could threaten to hold up their aid money, the fact is that any such move would signal to the markets that Washington had lost confidence in Brazil's commitment to reform. And that, in turn, could easily fuel the panic that Mr. Rubin, Mr. Camdessus and leaders around the world have been trying to quell.</p>
        <p>In short, with the commitment to help Brazil, there is no easy exit if things go bad.</p>
