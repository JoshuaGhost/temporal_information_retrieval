        <p>Hermes orange. Tiffany blue. And now, Pink pink. The new status gift box is from Thomas Pink, the British shirt store, which opened last year on Madison Avenue at 53d Street. The deep azalea-colored box with a black border is nearly as coveted as the shirts, ties, cuff links and pocket squares they hold. Customers collect them. One woman in London who has her Christmas trimmings done by a decorator is having all the gifts under the tree swathed in silver paper, except for the packages from Pink.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, James Mullen, a co-chairman of Pink, realized that the store's formerly white boxes and no-gift-wrap policy were too understated. ''We set about looking for signature packaging that would make the gift recipient magically happy,'' he said. The New York store's Christmas windows (left), with a tree made of pink boxes, might have seemed garish by the staid standards of Thomas Pink, the 18th-century Mayfair tailor for whom the store is named, but customers today don't mind. ''They're like steel -- these are not flimsy boxes,'' said the socialite Blaine Trump, who uses them to store ribbon, tape and other items. ''When you look at these boxes, you feel like you're in the pink.''</p>
