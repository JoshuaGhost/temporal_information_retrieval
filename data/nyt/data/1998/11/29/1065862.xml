        <p>It was a short week. But what a week it was.</p>
        <p>Merger mania, Internet frenzy and a new sense of optimism about the outlook for corporate profits sent stock prices rocketing higher and pushed three important market indexes to new highs.</p>
        <p>At the close of Friday's abbreviated trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, which reached its new high of 9,374.27 on Monday, stood at 9,333.08, up 173.55, or nearly 2 percent, for the week.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index also set a new high on Monday. But on Friday it bettered that mark, closing at 1,192.29, a gain of 28.74, or 2.5 percent, for the week.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index had the best week of all, rising 88.23, or 4.6 percent, to edge past its previous record, set on July 20, and close Friday at 2,016.44. The index is now up 28.4 percent for the year and has jumped nearly 50 percent since early October, when the market began its rebound in earnest.</p>
        <p>The bond market, which has been having quite a nice rally of its own, continued to perform well, largely on signs of further declines in commodity prices. Yields on 30-year Treasuries stood at 5.16 percent on Friday. The dollar gained in value against both the Japanese yen and the German mark.</p>
