        <p>Y the time Howard B. Moss enrolled at the University of Liverpool in 1966, the Beatles had left town, moving out into the big wide world.</p>
        <p>And that's what Mr. Moss, manager of the $1.23 billion Harbor International Growth fund, eventually did too -- alas, without ever seeing the band perform. (His student residence was on Penny Lane, the title of his favorite Beatles tune, and he calls himself ''a huge fan.'') Today, he works from an office in Fort Myers, Fla., for Jennison Capital Associates, a New York money manager that is subadviser of the fund for Harbor Capital Advisors of Toledo, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Still, it's a relatively small world these days for Mr. Moss, 50. About the only place he finds the sort of stocks he likes to buy is in Europe, where about 95 percent of the fund's assets are invested. The fund is also concentrated in its number of stocks -- just 24 in the portfolio.</p>
        <p>Using a bottom-up approach to investing based on corporate fundamentals, he likes well-managed mid-  to large-capitalization companies with long-term annual earnings growth of at least 15 percent and  forward price-to- earnings ratios below that rate. That kind of growth is hard to find in rocky economic landscapes like Asia and Latin America.</p>
        <p>His circumspect view may well have sharpened Mr. Moss's performance this year. It has achieved a return of 14.3 percent through Nov. 20 -- notably north of the 8.4 percent for its better-known, value-oriented sister fund, Harbor International, and the 8.3 percent average for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Over three years, Harbor International Growth has tallied an average annual return of 18.5 percent versus 16.2 for the sister fund and 9.2 percent for the peer group.</p>
        <p>In 1997, as much as 14 percent of the portfolio was in Hong Kong real estate and bank stocks. Mr. Moss reduced those holdings to zero by last summer, though he acknowledged that the Asian crisis still hurt the fund's otherwise stellar returns.</p>
        <p>Asian companies outside Hong Kong don't tempt him. ''With the debacle of currency devaluations and falls in the stock market, the companies we used to follow in places like the Philippines and Thailand, specifically, are no longer viable, in that their market capitalizations are too low for us to become interested,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for Japan, companies like Sony,  Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi ''have unfortunately become cyclical,'' in part because of slowing consumer spending there, he said. ''They are no longer secular growth companies on which one can rely'' for consistent earnings growth, he added.</p>
        <p>So how is Mr. Moss playing Europe? While he doesn't see a recession there, he expects economic growth to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent annually over the next 12 to 18 months, from his estimate of 2.3 to 3 percent for this year. As a result, earnings in cyclical sectors like chemicals, steel and auto-making are likely to slump, while well-managed noncyclicals -- the kind he prefers, in any case -- should do much better. That points to drug, telephone and bank companies as outperformers. He expects European economic growth ''to pick up from the middle of 2000 going forward.''</p>
        <p>For companies that can expand, he said, the elimination of economic borders in the European Union offers huge opportunities.</p>
        <p>''From the individual company point of view, this will become the United States of Europe,'' he said. ''So you will see the growth of new, pan-European companies.''</p>
        <p>HE predicted that many of those companies would be based in southern Europe, where, after decades of high inflation and high interest rates, governments have adopted many of the disciplined economic policies of their northern neighbors. About one-third of his fund's assets are invested in southern Europe, mainly in banks and telephone companies, which often meet his growth criteria.</p>
        <p>The fund's biggest holding, at 6.4 percent of assets, is Unicredito Italiano, a Milan-based bank previously named Credito Italiano. Its chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is expanding the company, trimming costs and making it ''very shareholder-friendly,'' Mr. Moss said.</p>
        <p>He said earnings were likely to compound at more than 20 percent a year, and that the share price, 9,597 lire on Friday, could double by 2001. He started buying the stock last year at 3,400 lire.</p>
        <p>Another big position in southern Europe, at about 5 percent of the fund's assets, is Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone company, which has about 85 percent of the conventional, fixed-line business in Spain and 71 percent of the cellular market. Telefonica also has major stakes in phone companies in Latin America, where stock prices tumbled recently. But Mr. Moss said the growth potential of the Latin American telephone industry made those holdings a good long-term asset. He first bought Telefonica shares in 1994 at about 2,400 pesetas; they closed on Friday at 6,930 pesetas. He predicts  earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next four to five years and said share prices would tend to rise at the same rate.</p>
        <p>One of International Growth's newest holdings is Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical company, which Mr. Moss began buying at about 780 francs a share in late September. Last week, it closed at 1,049 francs. Sanofi has two new cardiovascular drugs -- Plavix, a blood thinner, and Avapro, which treats high blood pressure -- that it is marketing worldwide with Bristol-Myers Squibb. ''The sales have literally exploded,'' Mr. Moss said. He forecasts earnings growth of up to 25 percent annually for the next five years.</p>
