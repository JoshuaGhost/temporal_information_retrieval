        <p>Martha Grimes doesn't write them fast enough for me, so you'll excuse me while I savor for a minute the quirky charms of her new Richard Jury mystery, THE STARGAZEY (Holt, $25). There's the authentic English pub, of course, that gives the novel its title and a hint of its mood. This time, it's a spiffy neighborhood hangout in Fulham, a once seedy area newly gentrified by ''the chattering classes'' where Jury first catches sight of an elegant blond woman in a sable coat who disappears (perhaps to be murdered) on the grounds of Fulham Palace. Then there are the wondrously eccentric characters, including one grand old dame (the former owner of the sable coat) and a supremely self-centered little girl named Pansy. Finally, there are all the witty particulars that surface at the oddest times. ''Most people don't notice little things like this,'' a barmaid says to Jury about a curious postcard of a fish pie. ''You miss a lot in life if you don't notice little things.''</p>

        <p>Martha Grimes doesn't write them fast enough for me, so you'll excuse me while I savor for a minute the quirky charms of her new Richard Jury mystery, THE STARGAZEY (Holt, $25). There's the authentic English pub, of course, that gives the novel its title and a hint of its mood. This time, it's a spiffy neighborhood hangout in Fulham, a once seedy area newly gentrified by ''the chattering classes'' where Jury first catches sight of an elegant blond woman in a sable coat who disappears (perhaps to be murdered) on the grounds of Fulham Palace. Then there are the wondrously eccentric characters, including one grand old dame (the former owner of the sable coat) and a supremely self-centered little girl named Pansy. Finally, there are all the witty particulars that surface at the oddest times. ''Most people don't notice little things like this,'' a barmaid says to Jury about a curious postcard of a fish pie. ''You miss a lot in life if you don't notice little things.''</p>
        <p>Given all this, you want a plot, too? This one is strange beyond belief, strained in the telling (Assassins! Aristocrats! Doppelgangers! Nonsense!) and garbled in its conclusion. But if the big picture is absurd, the details are divine.</p>
        <p>Haunted since childhood by his eyewitness memory of his sister's murder, Paul Graves has the kind of nightmares that would send most of us screaming to a shrink. But instead of exorcising his demons, the protagonist of Thomas H. Cook's eerie suspense story INSTRUMENTS OF NIGHT (Bantam, $23.95) endlessly recycles the trauma in the bleak stories he writes about a police detective and a sadistic master criminal who battle it out in turn-of-the-century New York. Although his novels earn Graves a living, they don't do much for his mental health, and after 15 books, the author is no better off than his hero, whose ''view of life had turned so intensely grim that his character seemed poised on the brink of an absolute despair.'' Salvation (or is it damnation?) presents itself when the wealthy patron of a writers' colony in New York's Hudson Valley asks Graves to train his morbid imagination on the 50-year-old mystery of her best friend's murder. He doesn't have to solve the case, she tells him -- just dream up something credible enough to soften the pain and banish the ghosts.</p>
        <p>Cook does a lot better than that in this psychological horror story. With his fondness for a twisted narrative line and his appreciation of the nuances of terror, he devises a plot that harnesses Graves's gloomy fantasies to a greater evil that should shock him out of his obsessive brooding -- or shove him off his mental cliff. Although it's easy to miss the very real clues that Cook drops so artfully into the story, there's no ignoring his savage imagery, or escaping the airless chambers of his disturbing imagination.</p>
        <p>You're not a real New Yorker if you don't want to kill somebody, sometime: the umpire who blows a call; the crazy guy at the deli; your swine of a husband; even the Mayor when he's on some dumb rant. Mike McAlary, who regularly sounds off in a column for The Daily News, gives raucous voice to that invigorating rage in his first novel, SORE LOSER (Morrow, $24), which he aims and points like a loaded gun at some of our favorite public targets.</p>
        <p>A ladylike tennis pro named Ginny Glade gets to go first, when she takes a tire iron to the umpire whose lousy line call costs her a shot at being seeded at the United States Open. ''Murder was empowering,'' Ginny discovers. ''Murder, like winning, was thrilling stuff.'' And when that thrill wears off, there's more excitement to be had running around with Mickey Donovan, an attractive, if preposterously idealized, supercop who travels in the highest (and lowest) circles of power -- although always within bellowing range of the egomaniacal Mayor, a hilarious caricature of Rudy Giuliani in all his volatile glory.</p>
        <p>In manic overdrive, the hyperkinetic style eventually sends the story swerving off into total fantasy. But even then, McAlary is fun to read. The cops are cute, everybody is a screamer and the energy is pure New York.</p>
        <p>Crime marches on, even in wartime, and in the series of melancholy police procedurals that J. Robert Janes sets in occupied France, it falls to Inspector Jean-Louis St.-Cyr of the Surete Nationale and Hermann Kohler, his softhearted Gestapo colleague, to protect ordinary citizens from themselves. But, ''as always these days,'' Janes reminds us in MANNEQUIN (Soho, $22), ''crime had to be viewed through the occupation's prism, warped though that was.'' In the disjointed Parisian society of 1942, every local crime -- from a daring robbery of the Credit Lyonnais bank to the grisly murders of a dozen or more would-be fashion models -- seems rooted in the deeper moral chaos of these convulsive times. For all their efforts to focus the search for a missing girl from St.-Cyr's neighborhood, the detectives keep turning up sad or sinister associations between the army of occupation and a conquered people desperate to survive. Janes devises a shocking solution to the brutal crimes at hand, but his larger point about the complexities of human guilt isn't so easy to close the book on.</p>
        <p>Life in Toronto in 1895 was no glide across the ice, according to Maureen Jennings in her horridly graphic period mystery UNDER THE DRAGON'S TAIL (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $21.95). Even the high and mighty were plagued by syphilis, birth defects and loathsome skin conditions, and the lower classes were also malnourished and crawling with worms, while any woman, rich or poor, who needed an abortion or had to give up a child for adoption was at the mercy of her midwife. When Dolly Merishaw, an unsavory specimen of the profession, is smothered on her own hearth, the police dispatch William Murdoch to determine which of Dolly's shameful deeds drove one of her clients to murder. Despite certain plot transparencies, the grim story is told in forthright detail and put in a social context that elicits real sympathy for characters bound by class and biology.</p>
