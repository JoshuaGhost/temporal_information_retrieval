        <p>WHILE listening to David Robertson conduct the Juilliard Orchestra recently in Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Atmo spheres'' -- a remarkable performance, by the way -- I started to understand something of the difference between live and recorded music. The orchestra got to that point where the sound becomes a kind of buzzing, and here -- with the piece's dynamic variation projected as strongly as its continuity, and the noise now quite loud -- the effect vividly called to mind the composer's reference of his music to a childhood dream: he was in bed, and his room was filled with a spider's web in which candles, damp cushions and insects were all held. Sometimes in this dream, he recalled, a cushion would tumble, the web would lurch, and some beetles would be set free for a moment, only to get themselves caught up again and emit ''a stifling buzz.''</p>
        <p>But the contact with Mr. Ligeti's dream was not the main point. What struck me, as I tried to make out which instruments were responsible for the whir of coleopterous doom, and why I had not heard it quite like this before, was the immediacy of the sound. It was not just this one passage that sounded new. The entire piece had little connection with my previous experiences of it, nearly all of which had come through recordings.</p>

        <p>WHILE listening to David Robertson conduct the Juilliard Orchestra recently in Gyorgy Ligeti's ''Atmo spheres'' -- a remarkable performance, by the way -- I started to understand something of the difference between live and recorded music. The orchestra got to that point where the sound becomes a kind of buzzing, and here -- with the piece's dynamic variation projected as strongly as its continuity, and the noise now quite loud -- the effect vividly called to mind the composer's reference of his music to a childhood dream: he was in bed, and his room was filled with a spider's web in which candles, damp cushions and insects were all held. Sometimes in this dream, he recalled, a cushion would tumble, the web would lurch, and some beetles would be set free for a moment, only to get themselves caught up again and emit ''a stifling buzz.''</p>
        <p>But the contact with Mr. Ligeti's dream was not the main point. What struck me, as I tried to make out which instruments were responsible for the whir of coleopterous doom, and why I had not heard it quite like this before, was the immediacy of the sound. It was not just this one passage that sounded new. The entire piece had little connection with my previous experiences of it, nearly all of which had come through recordings.</p>
        <p>My intent visual scanning of the orchestra at this point was a clue. As mechanisms of sound reproduction improve, the day may come when one cannot distinguish aurally between sitting in Avery Fisher Hall (where this concert took place) and listening at home with headphones, though that day is a long way off. And with DVD and its future developments, the time may come when the impression of facing an orchestra can be reconstructed. But it is hard to imagine the technology that would allow individual watcher-listeners to use their eyes and ears with the range of choices available in any concert hall: to fix attention on a cellist's bowing, to scrutinize the field.</p>
        <p>Such an advance seems especially unlikely given that the whole effort of people in the film and television industries is to do the fixing of attention, the scrutinizing, for you. Few movies are generous enough with visual information and with pace that one's eyes can wander around and into the screen. This is one of the things that make Andrei Tarkovsky's films so special.</p>
        <p>Still, the freedom to relate ear and eye, while the bassoon, as I decided it principally was, droned with such agonizing intensity, was only part of the issue. Perhaps Mr. Ligeti's dream was the next clue, for it was a dream, as he himself recognized, about ''the hopelessness of elapsing time and of a past that could never be made good again.''</p>
        <p>Here in the concert hall, time was indeed elapsing. But at home, when you are listening to a record, it never is. The past of a recording can always be made good again: all you have to do is rewind the tape, press the start button another time. This is time that has already been experienced, music that has already been heard. In the useful term of Claude Levi-Strauss, recorded time is time ''cooked'': prepared not only by composers and performers, as any music is, but also by producers and the whole apparatus of the record business. Time in the concert hall is time raw.</p>
        <p>The fact of freshness is one thing, but the psychological difference goes deeper. Listening to a recording, one feels oneself to be receiving an object with an almost tangible existence: a length of recorded time. One can even check the precise length on the back of the box. Hence the invitation to try to reconstruct this object in one's head, to create an image of a shape, a form. That was what I thought ''Atmospheres'' was: a length of time that I had more or less copied from one sort of memory (dots in silver plastic) to another (brain cells).</p>
        <p>In the concert hall, though, there is no object being transferred. A performance does not exist until it is happening, and then it is gone again. Everything one hears is in the present, and has to be seized in the present. Perceived time is thin, and forever being renewed. As the brasses and woodwinds came forward with their diatonic chord near the start of the piece, like a rainbow arcing out of cloud, the moment moved into that bubble-thin, shimmering time of perception with an immediacy that cannot be matched when one is listening to a recording, which one knows to be repeatable, already in the past, already a memory.</p>
        <p>If recordings give the effect of music as a sequence of events, one after another, at a concert each event seems to flash on top of the last. Music becomes vertical -- sound on sound on sound -- rather than horizontal.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it needed a piece of relatively recent music to make this clear. After all, the great effort of composers in the classical tradition, from the Renaissance through the early 20th century, was to create a horizontal effect: to suggest, by all the musical means at their disposal, a continuity, to make the piece seem indeed an object in time. Once this could be taken care of by recording, composers were free to do other things with their time. Recordings may, by their difference, have changed how concerts are experienced. If so, they changed music by changing time.</p>
