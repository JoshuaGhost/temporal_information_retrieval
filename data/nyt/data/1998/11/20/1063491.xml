      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With so much postwar abstraction in New York just now -- Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning drawings -- it's a good time to consider some of the genre's contemporary masters. One is the German painter Sigmar Polke, who has a show of two dozen strange, beautiful, sort of abstract new paintings at Michael Werner Gallery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polke, 57, is an of-the-moment master, one for whom the very notion of mastery -- the virtuosic touch, the thrill of self-expression -- seems to hold little intrinsic interest. His painting is a post-epiphany, post-ego art, a hybrid thing, impure, mixing in a wide range of ideas and formal ploys like so many chemical additives. They preserve a tradition, and they also turn it into something else.</p>

        <p>With so much postwar abstraction in New York just now -- Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning drawings -- it's a good time to consider some of the genre's contemporary masters. One is the German painter Sigmar Polke, who has a show of two dozen strange, beautiful, sort of abstract new paintings at Michael Werner Gallery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polke, 57, is an of-the-moment master, one for whom the very notion of mastery -- the virtuosic touch, the thrill of self-expression -- seems to hold little intrinsic interest. His painting is a post-epiphany, post-ego art, a hybrid thing, impure, mixing in a wide range of ideas and formal ploys like so many chemical additives. They preserve a tradition, and they also turn it into something else.</p>
        <p>The very title of his show, ''Sigmar Polke: New Paintings, Printing Mistakes,'' gets the feeling of what he's about. It sounds both celebratory and debunking, formal, but also abject. For years Mr. Polke has been collecting examples of printing errors found in newspapers: the off-register photograph, the passage of smudged or bleached-out type, the strand of hair on the press plate that shows up as a streak on the page.</p>
        <p>Most of the paintings at Werner are based on such errors magnified many times so they became images in themselves, their original contexts unrecognizable. Some of the forms are amorphous and abstract; others take on new identities, as in the painting ''Structural Poetry,'' where a rupture in a field of Ben Day dots looks like a devouring cancer or a burrowing animal.</p>
        <p>In a few cases, Mr. Polke manufactures his own accidents. The elongated figures in ''From 'Learning to Learn Anew' '' are the result of his having dragged a picture through a photocopier. And in ''Break Domination,'' he introduces a literal gremlin in the form of a bizarre composite creature -- part human, part beast, part plant -- lifted from the margins of a medieval manuscript.</p>
        <p>This leering little grotesque -- a mistake of nature, you might say -- evokes the spirit of the myth-enthralled Joseph Beuys, who was once Mr. Polke's teacher. But it is also a metaphor for the mongrel, endlessly layered, decidedly unmythic medium that painting has become in Mr. Polke's hands.</p>
        <p>Everything in his inventive art feels reality-based, and nothing is simple. For years he has painted on printed fabrics, the kind used for curtains and tablecloths, putting images on images. Many of the works in the current show are done on stretched white polyester that turns transparent when moistened, so that whatever is painted on one side shows through as a distant ghost on the other.</p>
        <p>Occasionally he creates a further impression of depth by adding, in front of or behind the transparent ground, a sheet of openwork fabric netting with a diamond-shaped pattern resembling the wire mesh imbedded for security purposes in thick panes of glass.</p>
        <p>Ambiguities of surface and depth are especially pronounced in paintings that have been coated with countless layers of synthetic lacquers. In ''Salamander Stone,'' for example, the painted forms -- big black hand-rendered dots and a glistening, sluglike organic ''mistake'' -- seem to float like holographic images in an illusory three-dimensional space.</p>
        <p>The effect is an optical trick wrought through a careful recipe. Pollock and Rothko, using more traditional means, did somewhat the same thing: the former with overlapping skeins of paint, the other with fields of color that, if looked at in the right way, seem to palpitate with transcendental potential.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Polke is asking something different from painting, maybe something that only a television-generation artist could want, or even envision: an art object that offers transporting possibilities, but that also carries real-world information.</p>
        <p>This may explain why the banal and the visionary enjoy a happy marriage in Mr. Polke's work. His colors are prosaic. Some are pretty, others gross; most, doused in lacquer or resin, are just neutral. A few paintings are executed on a photo-refractive fabric that turns ambient light into a prismatic sheen, a magically tawdry effect.</p>
        <p>At the same time, many of the images in the paintings, the glorified glitches that have been hand painted, reworked, built up and fussed over, have a surprising metaphoric weight. The brainlike bulge that swells from the surface of ''Elementary Building Material'' seems to be packed with molecular forms and hidden meanings; a tabletop still life of a bottle and glasses in an untitled piece appears to atomize into a field of tiny rosebuds, which are actually the pattern of an underlying fabric.</p>
        <p>A painting like this comes from a culture of fragments, of ruins, of things coming apart, as the art of Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning does not. Their paintings were part of a still-romantic moment when abstraction was an intact, horizonless frontier. Mr. Polke's work -- unromantic (not even a little bit), conceptually grounded in defect, heterogeneous, intellectually probing -- is something else and very much of its time.</p>
        <p>It will be fascinating to see where he continues to take all this. But there is no question about his secure, maverick place in an exalted 20th-century lineage.</p>
