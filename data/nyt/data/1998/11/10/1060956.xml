        <p>Ten mothers with babies nearby in strollers jumped up and down in unison on the steps around the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, as their babies slept. Sweat poured off Elizabeth Firestone as she peered into the stroller at her sleeping 3-month-old twins, Henry and Jack. ''This is the only time in my day that they'll sleep at the same time,'' she said, out of breath.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Firestone, a 36-year-old child psychiatrist, has become a regular at Strollercize, a rapidly growing fitness program that started four years ago when one woman in the park tried to coax mothers off park benches to join her workout. It has expanded to include more than 150 classes a month, two indoor facilities and a new national licensing program.</p>

        <p>Ten mothers with babies nearby in strollers jumped up and down in unison on the steps around the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, as their babies slept. Sweat poured off Elizabeth Firestone as she peered into the stroller at her sleeping 3-month-old twins, Henry and Jack. ''This is the only time in my day that they'll sleep at the same time,'' she said, out of breath.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Firestone, a 36-year-old child psychiatrist, has become a regular at Strollercize, a rapidly growing fitness program that started four years ago when one woman in the park tried to coax mothers off park benches to join her workout. It has expanded to include more than 150 classes a month, two indoor facilities and a new national licensing program.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Trindade, the owner and creator of Strollercize and a personal trainer, came up with the idea after her first child was born. ''I would go to the park every day and see all the mothers sitting around. I knew there was a market out there.''</p>
        <p>The workout involves aerobics, toning and strength training. Participants do lunges, leg lifts and crunches as Ms. Trindade coaches and encourages. ''Why do we lunge, everybody?'' Ms. Trindade screamed at the mothers. ''Because we need the strength to pick up those toys!''</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Cotton, the chief exercise physiologist at the American Council on Exercise, praised the program. ''Physically, a workout like this can accelerate the recovery process by helping muscle tone, flexibility and endurance,'' he said. ''And emotionally it can help you overcome the insecurity you feel with the weight gain.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Trindade is constantly expanding the Strollercize program. A Mommy-Daddy program allows parents to work out together, and she recently started a class for pregnant women and soon will add one for mothers and toddlers.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Dakin, with her son Teddy next to her, picked up the pace in the class. ''It's tough to stroll down Madison with all the size 2's, so it's nice to be with other mothers who are going through the same thing,'' she said. ''I wouldn't be caught dead in a gym right now.''</p>
