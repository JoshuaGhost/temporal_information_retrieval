        <p>A 41-year-old woman charged as a juvenile in her mother's slaying in 1971 was ordered held without bail yesterday pending a report on her risk of fleeing prosecution, officials said.</p>
        <p>Patricia A. Hurt, the Essex County Prosecutor, said lawyers from her office told Judge Michael J. Degnan of State Superior Court in Newark that the woman, Susan Marie Watson of Schenectady, N.Y., posed a risk of flight because of the severity of her crime and because she no longer had ties to the community in Newark, where she and her family lived in 1971. Ms. Hurt said a statement was read in court in which Ms. Watson had told Newark police that she had shot her mother, Maylon Johnson, with a .32-caliber handgun she had found in her mother's dresser.</p>
        <p>Bail for Ms. Watson, who was 14 at the time, will probably be set within two weeks, Ms. Hurt said. She is being held in the Essex County Jail annex in Caldwell.</p>
