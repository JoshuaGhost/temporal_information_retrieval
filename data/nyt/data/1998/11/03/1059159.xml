        <p>IT was, Ray Markey admitted, a ''typical librarian thing to do.'' When a long series on the troubling allegations surrounding the municipal labor movement was recently printed in The Village Voice, the staff of the librarians' union, ever the dutiful researchers, snatched it off the Internet, printed it out, and sent it to the union's 1,850 members.</p>
        <p>This, of course, was an act of seriously subversive trouble-stirring within District Council 37, the umbrella group of municipal labor unions, in which dissent is as welcome as it is in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's City Hall. But the librarians have lately become experts at it, clipping dozens of critical news articles, printing fliers and engaging in the same old-fashioned agitating for which D.C. 37 used to be known.</p>
        <p>Over the last year or so, in fact, Mr. Markey and the bookish band of trade unionists he leads have become the loudest voices for change within the labor movement. Last week, at a meeting of presidents of local unions, Mr. Markey formally called for the resignation of Stanley Hill, the executive director of the council, because he had failed to investigate and end corruption at the 56 locals.</p>
        <p>''I think Stanley should resign, because he's responsible, as the leader of this organization, for the mess we're in,'' Mr. Markey said at the meeting, referring to the investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney and the rampant dissatisfaction with the contract Mr. Hill negotiated with the city.</p>
        <p>For this comment, he was immediately vilified by several other union presidents and loyalists, one of whom used a vulgarity to characterize the remark. But Mr. Markey, who has long experience helping readers and keeping order in branch libraries throughout Manhattan and the Bronx, is not the kind of librarian who prefers the orderly silence of the card catalogue. Even his critics say the moment was vintage Markey.</p>
        <p>''Ray can get caught up in the moment,'' said Jim Tucciarelli, president of the Sewage Treatment Workers, whose members, unlike Mr. Markey's, are not required to have master's degrees. ''If he believes in a cause, he'll dive in headfirst, whatever he's got to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Markey, who as president of Local 1930 represents the librarians and clerks of the Manhattan and Bronx library system, sees nothing startling about lovers of the Dewey Decimal System climbing the reference stacks to defend their union.</p>
        <p>''The nature of librarianship has changed,'' he said recently, sitting in the windowless office provided for him by the council at its downtown headquarters. ''They all have computer skills now, so they're a marketable commodity outside the public library system. But they're still being paid coolie wages, thanks to the contract we have. It's no wonder they're getting militant.'' The private law firm libraries and universities pay much better, he said, adding that there's no baby-sitting the neighborhood children whose parents use the branch as a day care center.</p>
        <p>YEARS ago, when Mr. Markey told his father that he wanted to be a librarian, his father, a bartender in the Inwood section of Manhattan, immediately asked, ''What's the starting salary?'' He was appalled to hear it was $4,800 a year. But Mr. Markey loved to read, got his bachelor's degree from Hunter College and his master's from Columbia -- all at night -- and started out as a clerk in the Municipal Archives. He worked his way up, becoming branch librarian in places like the West Farms section of the Bronx, where an organized collection of books is a precious cultural resource but where the troubles of the neighborhood in the 1970's could not be kept outdoors.</p>
        <p>''The fiscal crisis was devastating to the libraries,'' he recalled. ''We lost a third of our staff, and a lot of libraries were just shut down, and vandals broke into the buildings. The primary responsibility for maintaining discipline fell on the librarians, which gave them even more reason to pick up and leave.''</p>
        <p>Having been active in the antiwar and civil rights movements, Mr. Markey, who is now 58, decided to enter the union's leadership a few years later. In the early 1990's, when 50 librarians were about to be laid off, he persuaded the system to use endowment funds to prevent the layoffs. He was elected president in 1992.</p>
        <p>But now, despite a large city surplus, he once again finds himself fighting to prevent librarians from leaving the system. One reason the group is so angry, he says, is that its members are quite underpaid compared with librarians in other systems. In 1968, when the union was formed, local librarians were among the highest paid in the country. But the wage increases have not kept pace, and now the starting salary for a librarian in New York City is $29,007, compared with $39,564 in Los Angeles County, $37,656 in Greenwich, Conn., and $33,496 in Lindenhurst, on Long Island. As a result, experienced librarians are simply leaving the city, creating more than 60 vacancies in branch libraries around Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The librarians, stuck with the same contract as the other municipal unions, have resorted to an unusual tactic: they are relying on the management of the libraries to negotiate with the city for a special wage increase, to keep any more vacancies from devastating the library system. If that doesn't work, book borrowers can expect to see something unusual outside their branches next spring: militant librarians, with properly spelled picket signs.</p>
