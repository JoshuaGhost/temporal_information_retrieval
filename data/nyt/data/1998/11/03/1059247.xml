        <p>California voters to decide whether to return to closed Presidential primaries, in which only registered Democrats and Republicans may cast ballots; two parties refuse to send delgates chosen in open primaries, system now used in California; old system will have to be brought back if state is to be bigger player in Presidential nominating game (S)</p>

        <p>Political contests, by definition, typically have a winner and a loser. But in California, if final polls have it right, one of Tuesday's contests is going to produce two losers: the Democratic and Republican parties and, beyond that, maybe the whole state.</p>

        <p>Political contests, by definition, typically have a winner and a loser. But in California, if final polls have it right, one of Tuesday's contests is going to produce two losers: the Democratic and Republican parties and, beyond that, maybe the whole state.</p>
        <p>On the ballot is an obscure proposal, labeled Proposition 3, that calls for the state to revert to ''closed'' primaries, as opposed to ''open'' primaries, when choosing Presidential candidates.</p>
        <p>The open system, which allows Republicans to vote for Democrats if they wish, and vice versa, was adopted by the state two years ago, and is a relative rarity in Presidential politics. Both national parties refuse to seat delegates chosen in open primaries, arguing that the practice skews the political system.</p>
        <p>So if Proposition 3 fails, and it was behind by a margin of roughly 2 to 1 in the final polls, California's Democratic and Republican parties will have to come up with alternative voting systems, like caucuses or conventions, for Election 2000.</p>
        <p>And that's not the half of it.</p>
        <p>If Proposition 3 fails, the state might as well junk its new plan to become a bigger player in the Presidential nominating game by holding its primaries in early March, rather than in early June. The date was advanced because the national primary system has become so heavily front-loaded these days that any primary held after May is essentially moot.</p>
        <p>But if the proposition fails, even a March primary would be moot. The political parties may then go to court.</p>
