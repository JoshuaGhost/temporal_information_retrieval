        <p>When the young woman stood before the microphones here on Feb. 11, 1994, and accused Bill Clinton of having made sexual advances toward her, not much of the world noticed or cared.</p>
        <p>Paula Corbin Jones said she was the Paula referred to in an article in the American Spectator magazine that asserted that state troopers procured women for Mr. Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. But she had been no compliant conquest as the article had implied, Ms. Jones said, and she wanted to set the record straight.</p>
        <p>Her accusations, made before a conservative political gathering, drew jokes at first. But soon they would form a lawsuit against Mr. Clinton, and eventually they would lie at the heart of an investigation threatening his Presidency.</p>
        <p>Turning points, and especially the wrong turns, are easier to see when the choices become part of the historical record.</p>
        <p>What if the Supreme Court had not ruled that a sitting President could be sued? What if the attitudes of Ms. Jones and her husband, Steve, had not been hardened by cruel remarks attributed, rightly or not, to the President's camp? Perhaps the suit could have been settled quietly. In that case, the name Monica S. Lewinsky might not have become public.</p>
        <p>But the Jones suit took on a life of its own, even an afterlife, considering that it hobbled the President long after it was thrown out of court last spring. Before it was settled on Friday, with Mr. Clinton agreeing to pay Ms. Jones $850,000 to drop her legal claim, a Federal appeals court was weighing whether to reinstate it.</p>
        <p>Whatever the pleadings said, the suit became much more than arguments over what did or did not happen in a Little Rock hotel room on May 8, 1991, when Ms. Jones was a state clerical worker. It became inspiration for serious debate about social values and the relationship between a President's private behavior and public record -- but it also became comic grist for late-night talk shows.</p>
        <p>Following Ms. Jones's press conference, Mr. Clinton denied the charges, saying he did not recall meeting her. ''He was never alone in a hotel with her,'' a spokesman said. (Later, that wording seemed most telling to people who accused the President of relying on nimble semantics as legal defense: of course he and Paula Jones were never the only two people in a big hotel.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton hired a lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, a power in Washington's legal and political circles, who called the case ''tabloid trash with a legal caption.''</p>
        <p>The first week of May 1994 was crucial, said two of Ms. Jones's early lawyers. The lawyers, Gilbert K. Davis and Joseph Cammarata of suburban Virginia, said on Friday that what they had wanted that May was a statement by Mr. Clinton clearing their client's name. A settlement seemed within reach, they said, so they delayed their suit.</p>
        <p>No such statement came from the White House, which, Mr. Davis and Mr. Cammarata said, tried to create the false impression that Ms. Jones had hesitated on filing because she knew she had no case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said on Friday he had known Mr. Bennett for some time and did not fault him for the White House tactics. ''I certainly believe you, Bob,'' Mr. Davis recalled telling the President's lawyer, ''but I don't much trust your client.''</p>
        <p>So on May 6, 1994, just in time to meet a three-year statute of limitations, Ms. Jones sued the President of the United States (and a state trooper who she said had conspired with Mr. Clinton to lure her into a liaison) in Federal District Court in Little Rock. She insisted that her motive was not money, although she sought $700,000. She attracted more legal and financial support from conservative organizations.</p>
        <p>In October 1994, the American Civil Liberties Union urged the Federal courts not to postpone the case until the President left office, as Mr. Clinton's legal team was urging. Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled that the trial could be postponed, but that pretrial questioning could proceed.</p>
        <p>The President was able to joke about the case on March 25, 1995, at the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington. One of the speakers was William J. Bennett, a former official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations and brother of the President's lawyer. ''He does something I can't,'' the President said of William Bennett. ''He can talk to his brother anytime he wants to for free.''</p>
        <p>The jest told a truth: Mr. Clinton's legal bills were mounting into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. A defense fund was created.</p>
        <p>In January 1996, a Federal appeals court disagreed with Judge Wright, ruling that the suit could proceed while the President was in office. Mr. Clinton's legal team said it would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>When the President asserted that his status as Commander in Chief entitled him to immunity, some veterans derisively recalled how he had avoided military service in the Vietnam War, when he studied in Britain. With the election nearing, the Commander in Chief facet of Mr. Clinton's appeal was dropped.</p>
        <p>About a month after Mr. Clinton was re-elected, a cruel remark of murky origin began circulating: ''Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find.''</p>
        <p>The remark, which offended Ms. Jones and hurt prospects of settling the case, was attributed to James Carville, the President's dagger-tongued political strategist. But on Friday, Mr. Carville insisted that his remark, made at a Washington political-discussion breakfast, was directed not at Ms. Jones but at Gennifer Flowers, who had said she had had an affair with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>There was another turning point in November 1996. Stuart Taylor Jr., a lawyer-journalist, analyzed the case and concluded that the evidence against Mr. Clinton was far stronger than many people thought. His article in The American Lawyer carried considerable weight among journalists.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 13, 1997, the case was elevated to constitutional status as it was argued before the Supreme Court, on the question of whether a sitting President could be sued for actions unrelated to his office. On May 27, the Court ruled unanimously that he could. Judge Wright then decreed that the trial would begin a year hence.</p>
        <p>One comment by Justice John Paul Stevens proved stunningly inaccurate. The case, he said, ''appears to us highly unlikely to occupy any substantial amount'' of the President's time.</p>
        <p>Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff, said on Friday the ruling set ''a terrible precedent for future Presidents'' who might be beset by scandal and scandal-mongers while trying to guide the country in peace and war.</p>
        <p>But Louis Michael Seidman, a Georgetown University law professor, said he thought the Court was right, regardless of any disruption in the work of the Oval Office. ''Courts can get rid of frivolous suits very easily,'' he said. ''This one wasn't frivolous.''</p>
        <p>By the late summer of 1997, it may have been too late to settle. Mr. Clinton's legal team was offering $700,000, along with an expression of regret without an admission of wrongdoing. Mr. Davis and Mr. Cammarata urged Ms. Jones to accept, telling her that her position would never be stronger.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jones had a falling-out with her lawyers. Soon she had a new legal team, along with backing from the conservative Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va.</p>
        <p>As he rode in a limousine to give a pretrial deposition in Ms. Jones's lawsuit on the gray Saturday of Jan. 17, 1998, Mr. Clinton knew he would be asked about other women as Ms. Jones's lawyers tried to establish a pattern of behavior.</p>
        <p>Hardly anyone knew then that he had been involved with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Even fewer people knew that Ms. Lewinsky's telephone pinings and yearnings had been tape-recorded by a supposed friend.</p>
        <p>At the pretrial hearing, Mr. Clinton was asked if he had ever had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. No, he answered, under oath.</p>
        <p>Hours later, perhaps even days later, it might not have been too late for the President to change his testimony, lawyers in the case have said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton had chosen a course of denial, one he would hold for seven months. Over that time, one of the few bits of good news for him was Judge Wright's dismissal of Ms. Jones's lawsuit. That happened on April Fools' Day, but the President's troubles were still far from over.</p>
