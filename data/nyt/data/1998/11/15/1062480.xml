        <p>Because the $206 billion tobacco settlement that emerged on Friday was reached by cigarette makers and state attorneys general, rather than Federal officials, it does not deal with the issue that cigarette makers have feared most: regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>But precisely because it only involves state governments, the latest proposal is also likely to shift the focus of the debate over smoking back to where many people believe it belongs, to Congress and the White House. Neither has shown much determination on the issue since the defeat last spring of a Senate bill that would have cost the industry $516 billion.</p>
