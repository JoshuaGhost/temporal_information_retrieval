      <abstract>
        <p>Letter by Greg Germann, writer who plays an imaginary character on the Ally McBeal television program, responding to Maureen Dowd Nov 11 article, questions Dowd's continued complaints about Ally's fitness as feminist spokeswoman and fact that Dowd continues to refer to Ally as if she were a real person</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With the regularity with which Maureen Dowd referred to ''Ally McBeal'' last year, and then most recently in her column of Nov. 11 (''Of Frogs and Newts''), we can happily be assured that Ms. Dowd is one of our most devoted fans. Still, over the past year I've felt a tinge of concern for Ms. Dowd's apparent loneliness. She continues to refer to Ally as if Ally were a real person. Anyone who has watched the show so obsessively knows not only that Ally McBeal is an imaginary character and not an imaginary friend, but also that the show is a comedy and not a political soapbox.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With the regularity with which Maureen Dowd referred to ''Ally McBeal'' last year, and then most recently in her column of Nov. 11 (''Of Frogs and Newts''), we can happily be assured that Ms. Dowd is one of our most devoted fans. Still, over the past year I've felt a tinge of concern for Ms. Dowd's apparent loneliness. She continues to refer to Ally as if Ally were a real person. Anyone who has watched the show so obsessively knows not only that Ally McBeal is an imaginary character and not an imaginary friend, but also that the show is a comedy and not a political soapbox.</p>
        <p>Also, Ms. Dowd's continued complaints about Ally's fitness as a feminist spokeswoman and the length of her skirts certainly don't represent the views of all McBeal devotees, who find our frivolous escapades, well, frivolous.</p>
        <p>That Ms. Dowd appears to be entertained by our political leaders and to be led by our entertainers prompts me to say, paraphrasing what the great feminist icon and sometimes-imaginary character Gypsy Rose Lee once sang:</p>
        <p>''Ms. Dowd, let us entertain you!''</p>
        <p>GREG GERMANN  Los Angeles, Nov. 13, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer plays the imaginary character Richard Fish, the head of Ally's imaginary law firm.</p>
