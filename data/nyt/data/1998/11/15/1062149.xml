        <p>Artists may spend their days staring into the heart of darkness, but they are hardly indifferent to the bright trappings of success. A museum retrospective, a teaching stint at Yale, the news that your painting has fetched some ridiculous sum at auction -- these are not distinctions to sneeze at. Status is often big and noisy. But there is also the status of small, silent things. And I know of no prize quite as lovely as the one that measures just 4 by 6 inches and grants a work of art a new 60-cent life as a museum postcard.</p>
        <p>Postcards? Already I can hear the protests: How common and plebeian and absurdly cheap! But that's exactly what makes them so great. Unlike original works of art, which remain sequestered in Park Avenue living rooms or bolted to museum walls, postcards can go anywhere and be owned by anyone. And when people stand in a museum gift shop in front of a postcard rack, their faces tense with concentration as they try to decide whether they want the Watteau or the Warhol, they aren't thinking about price or investment value. (Nor are they wondering whether their purchase will match the sofa.) Rather, they're genuine fans. There is no purer gauge of an artist's popularity than a postcard rack.</p>

        <p>Artists may spend their days staring into the heart of darkness, but they are hardly indifferent to the bright trappings of success. A museum retrospective, a teaching stint at Yale, the news that your painting has fetched some ridiculous sum at auction -- these are not distinctions to sneeze at. Status is often big and noisy. But there is also the status of small, silent things. And I know of no prize quite as lovely as the one that measures just 4 by 6 inches and grants a work of art a new 60-cent life as a museum postcard.</p>
        <p>Postcards? Already I can hear the protests: How common and plebeian and absurdly cheap! But that's exactly what makes them so great. Unlike original works of art, which remain sequestered in Park Avenue living rooms or bolted to museum walls, postcards can go anywhere and be owned by anyone. And when people stand in a museum gift shop in front of a postcard rack, their faces tense with concentration as they try to decide whether they want the Watteau or the Warhol, they aren't thinking about price or investment value. (Nor are they wondering whether their purchase will match the sofa.) Rather, they're genuine fans. There is no purer gauge of an artist's popularity than a postcard rack.</p>
        <p>R.B. Kitaj, 66, a painter of moody figurative dramas, is one of the few living artists whose work has been tapped for the rack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''It's very satisfying,'' he says. ''I like to imagine a perfect stranger picking out my postcard and sending it to someone in another city, who will look at it and think, 'Oh, so that's how that guy spent his life.'''</p>
        <p>Joel Shapiro, 57, the esteemed sculptor of angular, sometimes anxious-looking stick figures, says that he finds it ''confirming'' to see his work on a postcard; it's nice to think that your vision ''has some communicative power.'' But then he adds in a worried voice, ''The only museum that has put my work on a postcard is the Haus der Kunst in Munich -- which was Hitler's favorite museum.''</p>
        <p>Only the tiniest percentage of artists will ever know the heady satisfactions of postcard fame. ''Oh, yeah, it's a big deal,'' Alex Katz says gruffly. His ''Red Coat'' can be found on the postcard rack at MOMA, where the images of a handful of living artists (Chuck Close and Ed Ruscha among them) face stiff competition from such sentimental favorites as Van Gogh's ''Starry Night,'' of which 24,800 cards were sold in a year, making it the museum's top seller.</p>
        <p>Some postcards are sent, but the best ones are kept, and whether they end up taped to the refrigerator door or buried deep in a sock drawer, they are mementoes, reminders not only of shining masterpieces but also of the teaspoons of time you spent in front of them. Perhaps you paused before ''A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,'' an emblem, among other things, of Seurat's supreme posthumous status, generating 13,316 postcard sales last year at the Art Institute of Chicago. Monet's ''Japanese Footbridge'' heads the list at the National Gallery of Art in Washington (with sales of about 10,000). But enough about feel-good Impressionists. The public also pledges allegiance to Jasper Johns's ''Three Flags,'' of which a record 4,889 postcards were sold in 1997 at the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
        <p>Such numbers matter, because the postcard business is a savage wilderness with no room for duds or losers. The single worst-selling postcard at the Met last year was ''Plaque in the Form of a Recumbent Deer Attacked by an Eagle,'' an ancient ivory from the Near East that sold only 15 copies. Need I add that it has been discontinued?</p>
