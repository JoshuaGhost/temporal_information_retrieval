        <p>After three robust weeks, the market was taking a breather last week. Then favorable international developments sent it off and running again. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 89.85 points on Friday, to close at 8,919.59 -- still down 55.87 points for the week.</p>
        <p>Giving rise to the optimism was the International Monetary Fund's $41.5 billion bailout package for Brazil. The announcement buoyed financial stocks like J.P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan and American Express, as well as those of companies like General Electric and Gillette that do a lot of business overseas.</p>
        <p>The general optimism, however, did not extend to Nasdaq prices. The index closed at 1,847.99, down 3.07 on Friday and 8.57 for the week. The main reason was weakness in technology shares. Dell Computer, a favorite of investors all year, reached a 52-week high of $73.375 on Wednesday, but it was hammered on Thursday and Friday, losing nearly 10 points. Dell reported 55 percent growth in earnings, slightly exceeding estimates, but traders wanted more. Also, Compaq announced a new direct-sales plan, prompting fears of heightened competition.</p>
