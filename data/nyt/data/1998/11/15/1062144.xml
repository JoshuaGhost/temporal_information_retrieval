        <p>In retirement communities, everyone starts over. Where you went to school, what job you held, the community and professional recognition you may have acquired -- these are the things you can't take with you. So when my 77-year-old father, Irving Rimer, and my mother, Joan, moved from Pennsylvania to a retirement community in North Carolina six years ago, he started cramming for the most important test of his new life: his driver's exam. He was more scared of failing, he confided in me, than he was when he was 16 and took it for the first time.</p>
        <p>Among older people, a valid driver's license is the ultimate status symbol. Driving means vitality, independence and the American way of life. In nursing homes in Florida, residents display their driver's licenses, like trophies, on their bureaus. In California, the highest status is conferred on those who can navigate the freeways. In older people's personal ads, single men have been known to boast, ''Will drive anywhere, anytime.'' As my father puts it, ''Your license is the sign 'I'm here, I'm there, I'm still myself.''' (He aced the test.)</p>

        <p>Among older people, a valid driver's license is the ultimate status symbol. Driving means vitality, independence and the American way of life.

        <p>Herb Corwin is typical. At 74, he likes to tool around Sun City Center, Fla., near Tampa, in a new Cadillac, which replaced his cherry red Grand Am. His first wife died, and he remarried last year. At the wedding, his cousin offered a toast in which he observed that the bride, Lucille, had landed the most eligible bachelor in Florida. Why was that? ''Herb,'' he explained, ''drives at night.''</p>
        <p>To give up your license -- because of illness or disability -- is a painful rite of regression. In one sense, it's like returning to adolescence. You can't go to the movies, the mall or a concert unless someone takes you. ''I don't want to be driven -- I want to be in control,'' my father says. But in another sense, it's worse: there's no 16th birthday to look forward to.</p>
        <p>Those who can't drive are loath to give up their cars. At a retirement community not far from St. Petersburg, one 86-year-old man, who asked not to be identified, admitted that he had to stop driving because of a devastating stroke. He did so, however, only under duress and pressure from his daughter, who confiscated his keys out of fear for his safety. A former star traveling salesman, he still keeps his 1996 white Mercury Marquis washed and parked out in front of his condominium: he wants it to seem as if he's ready for the open road.</p>
