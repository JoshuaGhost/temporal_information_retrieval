        <p>SOME day there may be Jeremy's Law, the way there is Megan's Law and Jenna's Law, laws enacted in the aftermath of tragic deaths of children and meant to prevent repeat occurrences of similar events. For now, there is Jeremy's Camp Safety Guide for Parents, written by Jodi B. and Robert C. Scheinfeld of New Rochelle, whose 10-year-old son Jeremy drowned last summer while at sleep-away camp.</p>
        <p>Jeremy was attending Camp Scatico in Columbia County, where Mrs. Scheinfeld worked as the tennis director at the girls' camp. According to a lawsuit filed by his parents, Jeremy drowned off camp grounds on July 1 at Roeliff Jansen Kill, during a game that required him to jump into the rapids with full hiking clothing and footwear; the activity was supervised by counselors who had no water-safety or communication equipment. Jeremy's body was found entangled in branches at the bottom of the kill after an 18-hour search.</p>

        <p>SOME day there may be Jeremy's Law, the way there is Megan's Law and Jenna's Law, laws enacted in the aftermath of tragic deaths of children and meant to prevent repeat occurrences of similar events. For now, there is Jeremy's Camp Safety Guide for Parents, written by Jodi B. and Robert C. Scheinfeld of New Rochelle, whose 10-year-old son Jeremy drowned last summer while at sleep-away camp.</p>
        <p>Jeremy was attending Camp Scatico in Columbia County, where Mrs. Scheinfeld worked as the tennis director at the girls' camp. According to a lawsuit filed by his parents, Jeremy drowned off camp grounds on July 1 at Roeliff Jansen Kill, during a game that required him to jump into the rapids with full hiking clothing and footwear; the activity was supervised by counselors who had no water-safety or communication equipment. Jeremy's body was found entangled in branches at the bottom of the kill after an 18-hour search.</p>
        <p>David Fleischner, a director of Camp Scatico, said he could not comment on the lawsuit but said in a written statement, ''As a camp director and a parent, I support measures promoting safety awareness in camping.''</p>
        <p>The Scheinfelds's safety guide is available on the Internet at: www.campsafetyguide.com. Among its recommendations are how parents can investigate a camp's safety plans, staff training practices and water-safety policies. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mrs. Scheinfeld:</p>
        <p>Q. Before you sent Jeremy to camp, did you take for granted the camp's safety?</p>
        <p>A. I wouldn't say we didn't think about safety. I would say that we didn't look deeply enough into the details of safety. This was his third summer at this camp, and I was very at ease with the type of child he was. I felt very confident that he would thrive in sleep-away camp. He had very good judgment. So, I guess each year I did have more and more confidence about his ability to handle camp. I viewed camp as a place where kids could grow in an environment that would take care of them.</p>
        <p>Q. What are you trying to accomplish with your safety guide?</p>
        <p>A. We are hoping to raise parental awareness about the role -- the very active role -- that parents should play in evaluating a camp's safety before entrusting the life of the child to that camp. The very process of making an informed decision where there is a lot of dialogue with the camp director about the particulars of safety is a process that in itself will raise awareness of camp directors and improve the safety environment.</p>
        <p>I also believe that this is not a job that the parents can take for granted that any other organization will do. You can't rely on what the health department regulations are. You can't rely on the fact that the camp is accredited. The only thing you can rely on is your own inquiry and whether you feel comfortable with how a camp operates. Often when families look for a sleep-away camp, the process focuses on program emphasis, the cousin or the neighbor who loved it there, the positive feeling that the family perceived when they visited the camp. Certainly these factors are important, but our goal is to encourage parents to think safety first.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there information to be found in the written plans of camps?</p>
        <p>A. There is solid information which will give parents a sense of how things are run. You can get a good sense of the exact level of supervision during an activity or during free play. These are questions that can also be asked of directors; and if parents feel they are not getting enough information, then it's always good to see it in writing. During the school year, there are so many different advisory boards that parents can be involved with for school, in sports, in religious school.</p>
        <p>In contrast, during the summer, parents are very uninvolved; there is no parents association for the summer season. You can hardly speak on the phone to your child during the summer; camps have phone limitations. You get an occasional letter.  We're saying it's time for parents to be more involved in the summer.</p>
        <p>Q. What does it mean to be an accredited camp? Is accreditation meaningful in terms of safety?</p>
        <p>A. The American Camping Association is a very valuable association. It is certainly making its best effort to hold a standard in the camping industry. But you should know it is run by camps, camps trying to be their best. But when parents look at the word accreditation they assume many things, and they should look very carefully at what accreditation means.</p>
        <p>What it means is that the camp has been evaluated against up to 300 industry standards. Only 14 standards are mandatory. To be accredited, a camp must comply with 80 percent of the standards that apply to that camp. Parents should review what the mandatory 14 standards are and realize that 14 is not enough to assure safety. And I would tell you that the American Camping Association keeps confidential the 20 percent that the camp may not comply with.</p>
        <p>There was not one mandatory standard of the 14 that could have changed the course of events that led to my son's death. There was not one mandatory standard for the type of hike that he went on.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you know he would be taken off camp grounds?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. We knew it was part of the program. We knew they went on hikes. I assumed safe protocol, and I shouldn't have assumed it.</p>
        <p>Q. Do we need some new laws?</p>
        <p>A. State regulations are only as effective as their implementation, down to the weakest link of the camp staff. You may have regulations in place that people who are working at the camp may not be aware of. There must be effective communication and training so that these regulations are made known. And the regulations often have very little bite to the camp. If you violate a regulation, you pay a small fine, maybe $250. I don't believe that the state regulations are clear as to which bodies of water the camp can take a group.</p>
        <p>Q. What changes in the law could perhaps prevent another tragedy like this?</p>
        <p>A. One thing that we would like to see clarified in a law is that camps need to make sure that if they are taking children to a body of water outside the premises that that body of water has a permit. If it has a permit it insures that there are safety requirements that would be complied with by the operator of that body of water, including things like life-saving equipment, float lines and qualified life guards. Camps should be prohibited from sending their children outside their camp to a body of water for which there is no permit.</p>
        <p>We hope that the government will require standardized training and testing for counselors, so that everyone who works in a summer camp has achieved a minimum level in proficiency. The American Red Cross has a certification course for baby sitters. But they don't have one for camp counselors. If you're lucky, somebody in the group took first aid. You don't know what the qualifications are going to be for the people who are entrusted with the 24-hour care of your child because there is no standardized training.</p>
        <p>Q. What about other changes in the law?</p>
        <p>A. We would also like to require local health departments to monitor local water conditions and warn the public and the camp of hazardous water conditions and dangerous water levels. There are many bodies of water that are unmonitored. This could save many lives -- not just those of the children attending camp but whoever wants to go fishing that day. We would like to prevent swimming or entry into a body of water by campers who are wearing clothing or footwear because this event took place with sneakers. We want to require communications devices for all trips and hikes that leave camp premises. And we want to require the health department to grant access to all records, including safety plans, prior violations and prior complaints.</p>
        <p>We would also like to see a higher penalty level for code violations. Safety should be enough of an incentive, but if that is not enough of an incentive there should be threatening ramifications for injury and death.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you see your lawsuit as a way to send a message?</p>
        <p>A. Absolutely. This has been extremely difficult for us to come forward and share our pain. But we feel that out of love for our child and out of love for human beings we will come forward and will take on a public mission to try to make the camping experience safer. Our lawsuit is a deterrent that creates a loud message to camps.</p>
