        <p>Judy Spier letter responds to Wendy Lamb's October 4 essay on renovation of Grand Central Terminal (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>WENDY LAMB, a Manhattan book editor, wrote the Oct. 4 Soapbox essay, chronicling milestones of her life that occurred in Grand Central Terminal. She suggested that others record their memories of the place. The City section solicited ''most memorable moments'' and here are a few:</p>
        <p>It was the late 1960's at the height of the protests against the Vietnam War. I was a teen-aged hippie in New York. It was a time of protests, love-ins and be-ins. There were hippies, but there were also yippies. And a yip-in was scheduled to be held at Grand Central Terminal. I remember the entire terminal being filled with all sorts of people, doing all sorts of hippie, yippie things. It was an amazing sight. The police were not too happy about any of it and proceeded to lock arms and charge at us until they had pushed us up against the glass exit doors. I was frightened. But somehow we all got out of there, shaken up but not discouraged.</p>
