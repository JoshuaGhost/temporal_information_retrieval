        <p>Paul Newman, founder of Newman's Own Inc., told a group of Harvard Business School students that he planned a hostile takeover of the H. J. Heinz Company, according to The Harbus, the student newspaper. The actor-entrepreneur also gloated about putting a rival food venture started by Frank Sinatra out of business. He was kidding on both counts, of course. Mr. Newman, whose company has contributed more than $90 million to charity since its founding in 1982, enthralled his audience with his unorthodox musings about business. He started his venture as ''a joke,'' he said, and decided to give its profits away after putting his face on bottles and realizing how tacky it looked. But James Austin, chairman of the school's Initiative on Social Enterprise, saw an important business principle at work. Newman's Own, he said, enjoys a competitive edge because its do-goodism attracts customers, inspires loyalty among suppliers and employees and gets favorable press. ''Newman's Own reveals the synergistic relationship between the social purpose and the commercial operations,'' he said.</p>
