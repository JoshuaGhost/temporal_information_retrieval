        <p>IN 1994, when the Mashantucket Pequots announced plans to put $18 million into downtown Norwich, it seemed the dawn of a new age for the longtime down-on-its-luck river community. But recent tribal announcements have raised questions about whether the city will ever actually see much benefit from the Pequot wealth.</p>
        <p>The tribe, which runs the hugely successful Foxwoods Resort Casino near Norwich, first announced in 1994 that it would build an upscale apartment building that would incorporate the city's ornate architecture and would harken to the city's golden age at the turn of the last century when wealthy whaling ship captains lived there. The tribe changed its plans in 1996 and proposed building an upscale hotel in cooperation with a major international hotel chain.</p>

        <p>IN 1994, when the Mashantucket Pequots announced plans to put $18 million into downtown Norwich, it seemed the dawn of a new age for the longtime down-on-its-luck river community. But recent tribal announcements have raised questions about whether the city will ever actually see much benefit from the Pequot wealth.</p>
        <p>The tribe, which runs the hugely successful Foxwoods Resort Casino near Norwich, first announced in 1994 that it would build an upscale apartment building that would incorporate the city's ornate architecture and would harken to the city's golden age at the turn of the last century when wealthy whaling ship captains lived there. The tribe changed its plans in 1996 and proposed building an upscale hotel in cooperation with a major international hotel chain.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the tribe revealed plans for a more modest, unadorned hotel building that some residents said resembled a dormitory or a nursing home.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's announcement was the latest of a series of disappointments for Norwich residents. In October, the tribe had announced that construction of the downtown hotel would not start until a new study was made of the changing market for hotel rooms in southeastern Connecticut. At that time, an official of the tribal council complained that the state and the city were not doing their part financially to support the hotel project while putting substantial amounts of money into commercial projects nearby.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Reels, who was recently elected chairman of the tribal council, said the hotel project was not getting its fair share of state grants and needed more such support. As part of a state effort to spur  development in urban areas, the state has put up $500,000 of grant money for Norwich, and that is for  construction of a parking garage.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Reels said, millions of state dollars have gone to encourage development at  Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical giant that operates a large research center in the nearby city of Groton, and the state put $3.65 million into the construction of a parking garage for the Konover Hotel Group's planned $10 million restoration of the Wauregan  Hotel, near the site of the tribe's planned hotel in Norwich.</p>
        <p>The Norwich City Manager, William G. Tallman, disputed Mr. Reels' figures. The tribe's proposed project has received more than $2.4 million in state and city support, he says. Mr. Tallman said in a letter to Mr. Reels that the tribe was getting more state grant money than the Konover Hotel Group would get for the Wauregan project. The $3.65 million is for a parking garage that will provide 150 parking spaces specifically for the Wauregan Hotel,  and about 200 other spaces to relieve downtown parking pressure. A centerpiece for the downtown development project, called the Mercantile Exchange Block, was bought by for $750,000 by the city, which spent an additional $70,000 in an eminent domain settlement for a property that is also being used for the tribe's hotel project.</p>
        <p>''The city extended themselves in good faith,'' said Bill Stanley, a former State Senator and local newspaper columnist. ''The Mashantucket  Pequot have not yet reciprocated.''  The tribe's hotel project site is 8  miles from the tribe's Foxwoods casino and just 3 miles from the Mohegan Sun Casino, said Mr. Stanley. He said it seemed as if the Mashantucket Pequot may not want to build a hotel that would probably benefit the Mohegan Sun Casino far more than Foxwoods.</p>
        <p>The Mashantucket Pequot are committed to assisting in Norwich's redevelopment efforts, says Susan Viafora, a tribal spokeswoman. She said the tribe has spent millions of dollars for demolition and an archeological survey. But she added that given how dramatically market conditions for hotel rooms are changing it was still reasonable to study the hotel market before beginning construction. ''The tribe wants to do  what is best for the city of Norwich and the tribal constituency,'' Ms.  Viafora said .</p>
        <p>The more modest hotel plan announced last week was a result of the study, which showed that Norwich could not support a luxury four-star hotel with rooms going for about $180 a night, said Robert Birmingham, the tribal planner.</p>
        <p>Despite the disappointment expressed by some city residents the  hotel was approved by the city's planning commission and construction is scheduled to begin on July 1.</p>
        <p>But there were continuing doubts by some Norwich residents. Dale  Plummer, the Norwich City Historian, called the latest hotel plan ''an insult to the city.'' Arthur Lathrop, president of the Norwich Heritage Trust, said the ''boxlike'' structure was not appropriate for downtown.</p>
        <p>Another resident, Thomas Bjorg questioned whether the tribe was ever serious about aiding the city's  downtown redevelopment. ''A question people should be asking,'' he said, ''is why would the Mashantucket Pequot want to do anything  that would take people away from the slot machines and bring them to  Norwich?' ''</p>
        <p>Ron D. Aliano, a local businessman who is involved in another project  with the Pequots, offered this reply to the doubters: ''If you look at Las  Vegas you can see the new thinking in the casino industry is that there must be other things beside gambling to attract the most people. Museums, historic districts, a wide range of available activities and entertainment doesn't compete with, but complements casinos.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aliano is the owner of the American Wharf development on the city's waterfront, where the tribe planned to base its high-speed passenger boat, the Sassacus. To accommodate the Sassacus, which had been built by the tribal-owned Pequot River Shipworks in Norwich, the city put up about $280,000 and Mr.  Aliano spent another $170,000 to build a 186-foot-long floating concrete pier. But the Sassacus has never used the pier to bring passengers to Norwich from New York City and other locations. During a test run on the Thames River, bystanders observed that at normal operating speed the Sassacus raised a potentially destructive wake.</p>
        <p>The main problem the Sassacus has, says Mr. Aliano, is that it burns 800 gallons of fuel an hour. The extra hour of operation needed to get to  and from Norwich is just not practical, he said. The tribe is considering  the construction of boats with a different kind of engine that would make runs to Norwich more feasible, he said.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter if the Sassacus uses the dock or doesn't use the  dock,'' Mr. Aliano said. ''It will be used.'' A 70-foot yacht built in 1929 is using the new pier, and Mr. Aliano  and Mr. Tallman say cruise lines have expressed interest.</p>
        <p>City officials and residents say they're much more hopeful about the  completion of a development project involving the Mohegans. In 1995 the city was given a $250,000 state grant to start the development of a communication and technology instruction center in the Masonic Temple. But during a 1997 archeological survey, remnants of Mohegan burials were found.</p>
        <p>According to municipal histories, the Masonic Temple and its grounds are on an ancient burial site, where the tribe's leaders, including the  Great Sachem Uncas were buried. The cemetery, the Royal Mohegan Burial Ground, covered 26 acres between the falls of the Yantic River and Chelsea Parade.</p>
        <p>The area is now a thickly populated residential neighborhood. The city  had an understanding with the Mohegans that the burial ground was to  remain consecrated ground. But in 1842, with the complicity of the  tribe's state-appointed overseer, the agreement was violated and the land was used for agriculture and residential development.</p>
        <p>When the remains were found last year, the Mohegans asked that all  excavation plans be halted. But in February the city, the Mohegans and the state came to an agreement on proceeding with the project.</p>
        <p>It was agreed no further excavations would be made. In addition to a  technology and communication education center -- which would offer  instruction in state of the art television, computer and communication  technology -- the theater in the building would be renovated and expanded into a performing arts center. A museum/memorial was to be established for Uncas, and for the other tribal leaders and ancestors buried in the Royal Mohegan Burial Ground. The city agreed to donate the Masonic Temple building, and the state agreed to contribute $5 million if a study concluded it was a feasible development project and the tribe would contribute another $5  million. In addition, the tribe is searching for an alternate meeting  place for the Masonic Lodge.</p>
        <p>The state has completed the feasibility study on the costs and uses of  the project and submitted it to Peter Ellef, Gov. John G. Rowland's chief  of staff. A final decision regarding the study has not yet been made, said  Nuala Ford, a spokeswoman for Governor Rowland.</p>
        <p>The Mohegan Tribe's leaders say the wealth generated by the Mohegan Sun Casino will not be hoarded,  but used to benefit the community at large, said Mr. Stanley, the newspaper columnist, and there was no reason not to believe them at this point.</p>
