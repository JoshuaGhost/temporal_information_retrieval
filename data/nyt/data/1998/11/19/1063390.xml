        <p>Talk shows are undeniably successful staples of television and radio. So it's not surprising that Talkspot is attempting to adapt the format for the Web. Talkspot (www.talkspot.com), following the lead of Web-based audio services offering music, has four channels aimed at different tastes that are delivered using Real Audio.</p>
        <p>The topics are familiar to even a casual talk show listener: astrology, politics (mostly conservative), parenting advice, weight loss and, on Channel Z, off-color shock-jock humor, ''where everything is politically incorrect and proud of it!'' James Golden, Talkspot's vice president for programming and host of two shows, acknowledged that one potential attraction of Web talk was that it could not be curbed by the Federal Communications Commission. ''Much of Channel Z pushes the borders,'' said Mr. Golden, a former producer of Rush Limbaugh's radio show who appeared on the air under the name Bo Snerdly. ''However, we have standards here too.''</p>
        <p>As in conventional broadcasting, listeners can also pitch their views or question guests through toll-free phone lines.</p>
