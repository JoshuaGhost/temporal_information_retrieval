        <p>THE wellness biz is in strapping good health and growing like a weed -- or rather, a ginkgo tree. These days, invoking the word ''spa,'' with all of its Rorschach associations -- pampering, cleansing, oases, antitoxins and the leaf of that stinky tree -- can rejuvenate everything from shampoos and sheets to forks and furniture. And now the much-anticipated W, a business hotel and spa, is set to open on Dec. 1 within the shell of the modestly drab Doral Inn after an $80 million face lift.</p>
        <p>Beauty salons and gyms have already discovered the potency of the S-word. When the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon -- a Manhattan pilgrimage for women of a certain age since 1910 -- reopened last year after a $5 million renovation, it was rechristened the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon and Spa. The idea was to attract a hipper, more health-conscious clientele with offerings like the Sea Spa Pedicure (described as ''a facial for the feet'') and the forthcoming wellness lecture series. In early November, the Avon lady hit the ground running with the 20,000-square-foot Avon Centre Spa, Salon and Store in the Trump Tower, where it is possible to partake of exotic ablutions like the Aromatherapy Salt Glow Escape. Not to be outpaced, Helena Rubinstein plans to open a $6 million spa and shop in SoHo next April.</p>

        <p>THE wellness biz is in strapping good health and growing like a weed -- or rather, a ginkgo tree. These days, invoking the word ''spa,'' with all of its Rorschach associations -- pampering, cleansing, oases, antitoxins and the leaf of that stinky tree -- can rejuvenate everything from shampoos and sheets to forks and furniture. And now the much-anticipated W, a business hotel and spa, is set to open on Dec. 1 within the shell of the modestly drab Doral Inn after an $80 million face lift.</p>
        <p>Beauty salons and gyms have already discovered the potency of the S-word. When the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon -- a Manhattan pilgrimage for women of a certain age since 1910 -- reopened last year after a $5 million renovation, it was rechristened the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon and Spa. The idea was to attract a hipper, more health-conscious clientele with offerings like the Sea Spa Pedicure (described as ''a facial for the feet'') and the forthcoming wellness lecture series. In early November, the Avon lady hit the ground running with the 20,000-square-foot Avon Centre Spa, Salon and Store in the Trump Tower, where it is possible to partake of exotic ablutions like the Aromatherapy Salt Glow Escape. Not to be outpaced, Helena Rubinstein plans to open a $6 million spa and shop in SoHo next April.</p>
        <p>But increasingly, the wellness theme is showing up in products and projects well beyond the water's spray. Source Perrier, purveyors of the elixir water, has unleashed a torrent of home furnishings, from hurricane lamps to napkins embroidered with, yes, ginkgo leaves. Last month, Wamsutta brought out sheets in what it described as ''therapeutic colors'' (crystal, spa, aloe, oasis), ''healing fabrics'' (cotton, chenille) and patterns inspired by nature (again, that leaf). In case you forgot, extract from the 300-million-year-old ginkgo is thought to enhance the memory.</p>
        <p>Ralph Lauren's spring collection of sea-grass tables and woven rattan and blond wood beds (described as a ''therapeutic environment'') was named Spa until his lawyers advised a switch to something more generically holistic: Naturals. Even J. Peterman, the mail-order outfit, has designated six ''spa'' pages in its new catalogue for selling diverse items like ''spa storage boxes,'' cashmere sweater sets, chrome shower heads and a limited-run reprint of a 1920's poster of a Belgian spa.</p>
        <p>''The spa concept is traveling at an incredible rate,'' said Barbara Caplan, a partner in Yankelovich Partners, the research and consulting company. ''We've been watching it like a hawk. It used to mean just losing weight -- my mother went to milk farms -- but it moved on to pampering in the most general sense. We're expecting it to be marketed to a fare-thee-well.''</p>
        <p>ENTER W, the boutique hotel at Lexington Avenue and 50th Street, with a 10,000-square-foot spa and health club. The hotel, by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, is the most ambitious extension yet of this all-purpose feel-good brand -- although spending the night there last week, in the final stages of its renovation, turned out to be anything but relaxing as jackhammers serenaded guests from dawn to dusk. While the hotel never closed during construction, it certainly won't be able to offer its spa services full tilt until the grand opening.</p>
        <p>''One of the first things we talked about in brainstorming was designing the hotel from the spa outward,'' said David Rockwell, the Manhattan architect, known more for zeal than Zen. ''It permeates every part of the project.'' For starters, visitors will be offered a glass of juice on checking in at a front desk decorated with potted herbs.</p>
        <p>Until now, the standard personality of the boutique hotel has been mercilessly chic and darkly atmospheric. W takes the opposite tack with a double-height lobby with enough pale wood to camouflage a snow dog.</p>
        <p>''The hotel as evening spot and club has been explored to death, but the idea of leaving a light and airy hotel feeling better than when you came -- that's entirely unique in New York,'' Mr. Rockwell said, adding, ''I mean, where do all of us who don't look like models go?''</p>
        <p>Yes, but will ''We met over juice'' resonate in the business crowd that is meant to be the core clientele? If the answer is no, there's also a whisky bar.</p>
        <p>If anything, W goes overboard in the pursuit of spa-ness. Fruits and vegetables not only will be available at the juice bar, but are also printed on upholstery, photographically transferred onto plaster walls, submerged in gigantic aqua bottles and amassed in Joseph Cornell-like boxes on the lobby wall and in each room (asthmatics, beware). The ubiquitous ginkgo appears in a two-story window wall, a balcony, bathroom transoms and elevator ceilings.</p>
        <p>The lobby hits geological overdrive with its loaded array of natural materials. The front desk is quarried schist; the wall dividing the lobby and restaurant (offering healthful fare from Drew Nieporent) is of limestone. The floors are slabs of Kota stone; in the bar, sheets of mica are lighted from behind. The lobby columns are sheathed in billowing silk. Some cocktail tables look like tree stumps; others have tops of crushed sunflower seeds.</p>
        <p>Everything in the hotel was custom-designed by the Rockwell Group or made by artisans. ''In today's society, we overdesign everything,'' said Barry S. Sternlicht, the chairman of Starwood Hotels and Resorts. ''I kept steering Rockwell to less is more, but I'm not sure I succeeded.''</p>
        <p>If the public spaces offer an extreme-sport version of calm, the bedrooms are an abstinence diet. The rooms -- there are 720, about 70 more than in the Doral; rates range from $279 to $425 a night -- are generally tiny: the width of a queen-size bed and a television set. There are no bureaus, no bedside tables, no drawers in the desk. There is a patch of grass on the windowsill and a watering can.</p>
        <p>The bedding is amply plush: a feather bed with a goose-down comforter whose border is etched with phrases that might have been penned by an Iron John blissed out after a too-tight seaweed wrap: ''Dance With Abandon,'' ''Sleep With Angels,'' ''Dream With Lucidity,'' to recite a few.</p>
        <p>''We spent the money on the bed -- it's where we started,'' Mr. Sternlicht said. ''I interviewed John Pawson, the minimalist, but I didn't want people sleeping on rocks. A quiet, clean room with a great bed and great water pressure -- that's all people really want. Oh, and good movies on the TV. There's nothing worse than it's 9:55 and four movies to pick from -- there'll be a little spice in the collection.'' That is, if the New York scene weren't racey enough.</p>
        <p>The spa fills a double-height space on the fourth floor but is not yet finished. Besides saunas and massage rooms, more esoteric treatments will be on order, including shirodhara, a treatment involving hot herbal oil dripping on ''the third eye''; Javanese lulu, a cleansing rub meant for Javanese brides on their wedding day, and aura-photographic imaging and analysis: ''Gain a new persective about your emotions and well-being,'' the brochure says. How about a new perspective on sagging sales figures?</p>
        <p>''We've bastardized the spa concept,'' said Monica Tuma Brown, a spa consultant. ''Americans take relaxation too seriously, and we constantly filter everything through work. So now if you attach the word 'spa' and spend some money, it's O.K. to relax.''</p>
        <p>As the number of companies offering yoga classes and masseuses increases (at Rockwell Group, there is a part-time ''health and wellness director'') and as the lines between work and leisure continue to dissolve, hotels like W, bent on delivering facials as well as faxes, may become more of a norm. It makes sense to Paul Wilmot, a publicity agent for the new Rubinstein spa. ''We've all become students of spas,'' he said. ''I'm 52, and I work a lot harder than my 52-year-old ancestors. I've got to go out to dinner three times a week. I fly to Europe five times a year. I need to feel better! For me, going to a spa is a near-religious experience.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Caplan, of Yankelovich, has come to believe that the trips she takes twice a year with her husband to spa country are an essential luxury. ''It just fits so many needs,'' she said. ''We won't be seeing the end of this one for quite some while.''</p>
        <p>If the ginkgo can survive the Ice Age, it can surely survive all this.</p>
