        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Contrary to Floyd Norris's assertions (Editorial Observer, Nov. 13), Salomon Brothers is neither dead nor sick. Rather, the company is changing to reflect today's realities. As we build Citigroup, we are working hard to respect the old as we build the new.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Contrary to Floyd Norris's assertions (Editorial Observer, Nov. 13), Salomon Brothers is neither dead nor sick. Rather, the company is changing to reflect today's realities. As we build Citigroup, we are working hard to respect the old as we build the new.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Norris ignores that Salomon Brothers' global reach, strength in underwriting and world leadership in fixed income and trading strategically meshed with Smith Barney's retail distribution network, asset management business and strength in equities and municipal finance. The two firms' prominent investment banking and research franchises complemented each other well. The two firms are much stronger together.</p>
        <p>With the formation of Citigroup, Salomon Smith Barney has an even stronger platform from which to grow. Have we had a rocky start? Yes. But we have already demonstrated that together, Salomon Smith Barney and Citicorp bankers can make a real difference in  meeting our clients' financial  needs.</p>
        <p>SANDY WEILL  JOHN REED  New York, Nov. 16, 1998</p>
        <p>The writers are co-chief executives of Citigroup.</p>
