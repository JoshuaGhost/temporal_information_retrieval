        <p>Gov. John G. Rowland strode triumphantly among Republicans twirling New Year's-style noisemakers at rallies in three packed halls today, while his challenger, United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, motored across the state to thank her supporters for their loyalty.</p>
        <p>In the final public splash by the two campaigns, Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat, worked to buck up her own team, while Mr. Rowland focused on spreading his luster to other Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kennelly had rented a 40-foot bus outfitted with leather sofas and swivel chairs for today's 11-stop, 14-hour schedule, and campaign workers had painted a big banner for the side of the bus that proclaimed her ''Better for Connecticut,'' and showed a donkey doing a jig.</p>
        <p>Then she woke up this morning and found that the front page of The Hartford Courant carried a poll showing that respondents favored Mr. Rowland over her by 57 percent to 19 percent.</p>
        <p>The news, which mirrored previous polls, did not seem to dampen the upbeat mood of the 20 aides and relatives who packed the bus. They clapped as patriotic marches thrummed on the compact disk system, and savored the memories of a much happier time as they watched a videotape from the state Democratic Convention in July.</p>
        <p>At a Democratic breakfast in Derby, Mrs. Kennelly's voice broke as she said: ''We have good times and we have bad times. But we know who we are. We're good, and we care about our community. And I thank you for being so nice to me this morning.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland, on the other hand, got a few days' jump on the calendar with what his campaign promoted as ''The John Rowland Victory '98 Tour.'' He was driven from stop to stop in a behemoth motor home.</p>
        <p>In Manchester, Mr. Rowland warned of the consequences for other candidates if his voters were so overconfident they stayed home. ''People say, 'I wish you good luck, but you don't need it,' '' Mr. Rowland said. ''You know what I say to that? Give me all the good luck you have and I'll be glad to spread it around and share it with others, or save it for another day.''</p>
