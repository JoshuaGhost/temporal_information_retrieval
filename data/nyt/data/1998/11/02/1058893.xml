        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Shahn's World</p>
        <p>Out of leading museums and private collections from Japan to the Vatican come more than 50 paintings assembled by the Jewish Museum in what is described as the first major museum exhibition in 22 years of the works of Ben Shahn. Commemorating the centennial of the artist (1898-1969), ''Common Man, Mythic Vision: The Paintings of Ben Shahn,'' opening on Sunday and running through March 7, covers works from 1936 to 1965, focusing primarily on Shahn's mature style as it evolved toward allegorical, mythological and biblical imagery after World War II. Information: (212) 423-3200.</p>
        <p>Warm-Up</p>
        <p>Two years before the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Australia is not only beating the drums, it's also tinkling the piano keys, blowing the brasses, puffing the woodwinds and bowing the violins. All of which is to say that on Saturday at the Center for the Arts of the University of California at Los Angeles, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, led by Edo de Waart, begins a tour of the United States, its first in a decade. It will visit 9 cities for 11 concerts through Nov. 22. Besides Beethoven and Strauss, the orchestra will present the United States premiere of the Australian composer Graeme Koehne's ''Elevator Music,'' an attempt to bridge the gap between classical and popular music. The tour reaches Carnegie Hall on Nov. 17. Information: (212) 315-1300.</p>
        <p>Song and Dance</p>
        <p>Accolades, music, dinner and dancing will fill Avery Fisher Hall at 7:30 tonight when Jazz at Lincoln Center pays tribute to the saxophonist, composer and band leader Benny Carter at its third annual benefit concert. Titled ''With a Song in My Heart,'' the event, with Ed Bradley, the ''60 Minutes'' correspondent, as host, will feature the singers Bobby Short and Diana Krall and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis. Mr. Carter will receive the Jazz at Lincoln Center award for artistic excellence. The benefit supports the educational activities and programs of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Information: (212) 721-6500.</p>
        <p>Time Remembered</p>
        <p>How do you compress 30 years of accomplishment into a single night? That question will be answered tonight at 7 at City Center, the site of an anniversary gala celebrating the career and choreographic imagination of Lar Lubovitch. Besides selections from Mr. Lubovitch's greatest hits, performed by past and present members of his company, there will be Lubovitch ballets by members of American Ballet Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. A retrospective montage will alternate between film and live performances of excerpts from three decades of dance: modern, ballet, film, theater, television and ice. Information: (212) 581-1212.</p>
