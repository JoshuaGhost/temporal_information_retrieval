        <p>Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who has recommended that Congress impeach President Clinton, has acknowledged that his investigators should have kept closer watch on Linda R.

        <p>Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who has recommended that Congress impeach President Clinton, has acknowledged that his investigators should have kept closer watch on Linda R. Tripp, the Government employee whose furtive tape recordings precipitated the criminal investigation of the President.</p>
        <p>''I think we could have had better control of her,'' Mr. Starr said in an interview with ABC News to be broadcast on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>While yielding to second-guessing over his control of Mrs. Tripp, his main witness, Mr. Starr repeated his insistence, made before Congress, that his office ''had no indication whatsoever'' that Mrs. Tripp, after her interview with prosecutors, would immediately brief lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones about Monica S. Lewinsky's taped accounts of a sexual affair with the President.</p>
        <p>The President's flat denial of misconduct with Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones suit triggered Mr. Starr's investigation and eventual recommendation that the President be impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. Mr. Clinton's defenders suspect collusion between the Jones lawyers in the civil case and the independent counsel's office.</p>
        <p>In denying this, Mr. Starr, his impeachment recommendation against the President aside, said he found Mr. Clinton to be ''extraordinarily talented, wonderfully empathetic.''</p>
        <p>''I think he inspires just tremendous affection and loyalty by, you know, a wide range of people,'' said Mr. Starr, whose investigators have spent 10 months vetting many of Mr. Clinton's loyalists in trying to build a case against the President.</p>
        <p>ABC News released excerpts from what it said was an ''exclusive in-depth'' interview with Diane Sawyer on ''20/20 Wednesday.'' The full transcript was not released, just enough to encourage viewership for the interview with Mr. Starr, who told Congress last week, ''We go to court and not on the talk show circuit.'' ABC said Mr. Starr was not paid for the interview.</p>
        <p>In response to a question, Mr. Starr's spokesman, Charles G. Bakaly 3d, said Mr. Starr felt that, having testified publicly before Congress, it was appropriate for him to conduct selective news interviews. ''But we're not going to do a road show,'' Mr. Bakaly said.</p>
        <p>Unlike his Congressional appearance, Mr. Starr made no observations about whether the questions he fielded were fair, even when he was asked about his own sex life and criticism that he was ''self-righteous, sanctimonious.'' He denied any wrongdoing as flatly as any other Washington denizen has this year.</p>
        <p>''The answer to the big question is,  No, I have not been unfaithful to my spouse,'' Mr. Starr declared. ''I'm not trying to pat myself on the back, but I've tried to live by what I believe is my, my obligation and my responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sawyer followed up with, ''People wonder if you understand human frailty.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr responded, ''I've got plenty of frailties.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Sawyer asked what would happen ''if Bill Clinton is allowed to get away with this,'' Mr. Starr said, ''Lying under oath, and encouraging lies under oath, does go to the very heart and soul of what courts do.''</p>
        <p>Perjury must not be tolerated in the courts, he said. ''We do not want junior high students and high school students to in any way say there is anything other than zero tolerance for knowing untruthfulness in court.''</p>
