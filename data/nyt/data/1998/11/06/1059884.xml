        <p>Charles G. La Bella, the former head of the Justice Department's Campaign Finance Task Force, has been ordered by aides to Attorney General Janet Reno not to speak at two conferences on campaign finance law.</p>
        <p>Mr. La Bella has urged Ms. Reno to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate accusations of campaign finance abuses in the 1996 election. The Attorney General has resisted naming an outside counsel for more than a year, although she is considering whether to seek independent prosecutors in three 1996 fund-raising controversies. She is expected to decide late this month or early December.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's aides said their insistence that Mr. La Bella refrain from public appearances reflected nothing more than the routine application of a rule that prohibits prosecutors from speaking publicly about prominent cases. Mr. La Bella's allies maintained that the rule was not applied in all cases and complained that he had been muzzled because his views were strikingly at odds with the conventional thinking in the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>In July Mr. La Bella sent Ms. Reno a memorandum advising her that the department should refer the entire campaign finance matter to an outside prosecutor. He then returned to the United States Attorney's office in San Diego.</p>
        <p>In mid-October, the department told Mr. La Bella to withdraw from two speaking engagements at campaign finance conferences he had accepted months earlier -- one in Washington, sponsored by Congressional Quarterly, and another in New York City, sponsored by the New York City Campaign Finance Board and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York.</p>
        <p>''I regret having spent a year doing this and not being able to speak publicly,'' Mr. La Bella said in a telephone interview. In letters to the  sponsoring organizations, he said he had planned careful remarks on campaign finance that were limited to the law and published court decisions. But he also said he ''understood'' the logic of the decision.</p>
