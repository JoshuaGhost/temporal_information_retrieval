        <p>Eleven men who prosecutors contend are members of the New Jersey branch of the Latin Kings were charged yesterday in the killings of two gang members.</p>
        <p>Patricia A. Hurt, the Essex County Prosecutor, said each of the men was charged with murder, attempted murder and kidnapping, among other counts. The charges were brought more than six months after the victims -- Jimmy Cabrera, 28, and Omar D.

        <p>Eleven men who prosecutors contend are members of the New Jersey branch of the Latin Kings were charged yesterday in the killings of two gang members.</p>
        <p>Patricia A. Hurt, the Essex County Prosecutor, said each of the men was charged with murder, attempted murder and kidnapping, among other counts. The charges were brought more than six months after the victims -- Jimmy Cabrera, 28, and Omar D. Morante, 19, brothers from Jersey City -- were kidnapped and then strangled in retaliation for committing a drive-by shooting that was not authorized by gang leaders.</p>
        <p>Their bodies were found in June in Branch Brook Park in Newark.</p>
        <p>A third brother, Omar W. Morante, 19, was kidnapped with them but escaped while he and his brothers were being taken from Jersey City to Newark in a caravan of cars driven by gang members, said Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's office. Mr. Weiss said he did not know the whereabouts of the surviving brother.</p>
        <p>Among those indicted was Charles Byrd, 31, of Elizabeth, who prosecutors described as the leader of the Latin Kings in New Jersey.</p>
