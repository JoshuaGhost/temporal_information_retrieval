        <p>The nation is in a state of decay. The old moral code has broken down. Corruption is rampant. Crime is rising. The underpinnings of civil society are collapsing, and gloom is filling the void.</p>
        <p>He Qinglian, a writer whose hot-selling book, ''China's Pitfalls,'' outlines this apocalyptic view of contemporary China, is taking on the nation. She attacks wherever she sees darkness, and that is almost everywhere.</p>
        <p>''No one dares say the emperor has no clothes,'' Ms. He said in a long conversation in this southern Chinese city on a recent afternoon. ''They are all afraid. But I am not afraid.''</p>
        <p>Ms. He, 42, laments the terrible problems racking her nation today, in her writing and her conversation: officials abusing power, the widening chasm between rich and poor; and the wholesale robbery of state property that is one result of China's efforts to shift from a state-run to a market economy.</p>
        <p>A quixotic warrior, fighting hopelessly against a tide of relentless commercial fervor sweeping China: so Ms. He would paint herself. She certainly is unusual. Most Chinese writers are hemmed in, not just by publishers afraid of stepping over the line of what is permissible, but also by the pressure of a society that demands conformity and attacks individual thinking like a disease. Ms. He is proud to be different.</p>
        <p>''Most accounts of current history are too glowing, too positive,'' she said, donning a modesty that hides and reappears over the course of conversation. ''I felt there was a need for something more realistic.''</p>
        <p>Ms. He's unblinking look at the stunning scale of official malfeasance and corruption rings true with ordinary Chinese because they are so commonplace: the factory head who walks off with a company's property; the provincial official who determines a fixed price for each appointment he makes, based on the opportunity for payoffs; the monopolization of business by the well connected.</p>
        <p>Ms. He makes much of what she calls the ''marketization of power,'' an academic-sounding way of saying that people in positions of authority are increasingly making money. She also devotes a large section of her book to the growing gap between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. He's notions are so littered with exaggeration and pessimism that her punch loses its full force. Not all of the nation's billions in bank deposits are being squandered, as she asserts. Not every Chinese official is a crook; nor is moneymaking limited to officialdom. And not all Chinese people are immoral.</p>
        <p>In her voice, beneath the heavy disillusionment with everything she sees, lurks a hint of a disappointed idealist.</p>
        <p>''This is not what reform was supposed to bring,'' Ms. He said, her voice rising in indignation. ''Deng Xiaoping promised that some people would get rich first, not that they would get richer and richer, while the poor get poorer and poorer.''</p>
        <p>It may seem silly for anyone, especially an experienced journalist and trained economist like Ms. He, to have ever believed the Communist Party line that market capitalism would equally reward all Chinese.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it is hard not to sympathize with her despair over how the evaporation of Communist beliefs has allowed the party apparatus to turn into a network of opportunism. ''I see no way out,'' Ms. He said simply.</p>
        <p>She recalls the idealistic reformers who emerged in China 100 years ago, revolted by the decaying rule of incompetent emperors. Deflecting the suggestion, she chooses instead to point out that Chinese thinkers are still stuck where they were in 1898, proposing the adoption of Western science while preserving Chinese morals.</p>
        <p>''What morals?'' she asked indignantly. ''Chinese people have few morals. That is the most basic problem.''</p>
        <p>Ms. He's assessment of China's recent history seems to ignore the vast improvements in personal freedom and living standards of Chinese in all social strata, including writers like herself. But she brushes away the suggestion that she is being too pessimistic.</p>
        <p>Or that her view is colored by her location. Criticizing China's reform program from Shenzhen, a freewheeling frontier town bordering Hong Kong, is like relishing life in Las Vegas while harping on the excesses of American capitalism.</p>
        <p>Little more than a village 20 years ago, Shenzhen has since boomed as a model economic zone. Now a living exhibit of the extremes of China's economic reform, Shenzhen is overflowing with banks, private enterprise, prostitutes and con men.</p>
        <p>Ms. He moved here 10 years ago from Shanghai, where she completed a degree in economics. She has worked as a reporter at The Shenzhen Legal News for the last five years. ''I don't particularly like Shenzhen, but it is where I ended up,'' Ms. He said. ''I feel very much like an observer, an outsider here.''</p>
        <p>Lamenting the decline of morality and the flowering of adultery, Ms. He believes that China's basic problems are rooted in immorality and a lack of family structure. Like many urban Chinese, she and her husband put their only child, a 6-year-old son, in a sleepaway school, and see him one night a week.</p>
        <p>Nine publishers shied away from Ms. He's manuscript in 1996 when she first presented it, saying it was too critical. It was finally published last January after a version of the book appeared in Hong Kong and then won the direct endorsement of Liu Ji, a professor and one of President Jiang Zemin's closest advisers.</p>
        <p>The leadership's approval of this book is interesting, too. Mr. Jiang and his advisers want to portray him as opposing the corruption in China. They want to use a limited amount of criticism of real problems, as long as it does not blame the leadership.</p>
        <p>''I'm not criticizing leaders, I'm criticizing the system,'' Ms. He said.  ''Even the best leader can't thrive in a bad system.''</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' she added after a pause, ''criticizing leaders would limit my ability to speak freely.''</p>
        <p>Although her book has attracted attention in a relatively small corner of the intelligentsia, it sold out its initial print run of 30,000 in the first month. Another 20,000 copies were printed.</p>
        <p>''Then the pirating began,'' she said. ''Several times more have been printed that way.''</p>
        <p>Ms. He said she is uncomfortable with the attention her book -- not yet translated into English -- has attracted in the West. After an essay about it by Liu Binyan and Perry Link appeared in The New York Review of Books, she feared that it would be misrepresented by others.</p>
        <p>''People are going to take what they want out of your book,'' she said, adding wearily, ''There's nothing you can do about it.''</p>
        <p>Yet people are not welcome to take her name; Ms. He is suing a publisher who used her name on a book she did not write.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I feel I don't understand China at all,'' Ms. He summed up. ''The more I look at it, the less I understand.''</p>
