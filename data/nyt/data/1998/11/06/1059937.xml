        <p>Fresh from the election victory of his referendum creating new campaign finance restrictions, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is waging a new battle over the issue, once again pitting himself against the City Council, the city's Campaign Finance Board and a civic coalition.</p>
        <p>City voters on Tuesday adopted the Mayor's new financing rules, which are aimed at discouraging corporate donations to candidates for city office. Based on their passage, Mr. Giuliani contends that they supersede a different set of campaign rules, also intended to discourage corporate donations, that the City Council enacted two weeks ago after overriding the Mayor's veto.</p>
        <p>Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone says the Council's version of the law still holds. And the Campaign Finance Board -- the city agency that enforces the laws -- has ruled that the mayoral referendum is compatible with the Council law and has said it will apply both.</p>
        <p>The Mayor is demanding that the campaign board reverse itself and ignore the Council law. ''Even the Campaign Finance Board is not above the law,'' he said on Wednesday. ''You've got to accept the rule of the electorate.''</p>
        <p>The board has refused to budge, though. Its conflict with the Mayor could come to a head as candidates apply for public funds for special elections expected in February.</p>
        <p>The core difference between the two plans is that the Council's law would give candidates who refuse  corporate donations $4 in matching public funds for every $1 in contributions from noncorporate sources, while the Mayor would give such candidates a dollar-for-dollar match.  The Mayor says his plan would cost much less.</p>
        <p>But critics of the Mayor say that without the extra incentive in the Council's rules, candidates are likely to reject public financing. Before the election, the campaign board issued a formal legal opinion saying it would still apply the fourfold match if the Mayor's proposal passed.</p>
        <p>Attacking the board as ''rather arrogant,'' the Mayor said: ''So the people have spoken, and they do not want corporate contributions. They also don't want to be giving millions and millions of dollars to politicians. The Campaign Finance Board may want to, but the people of New York City don't want that.''</p>
        <p>But the board reiterated its stand, saying, ''It continues to be the board's opinion that the four-for-one matching rate by law applies to all program participants.'' The board also quoted the Mayor's own charter revision panel, which drafted the referendum, as saying in August that it deferred to the Council in modifying the matching formula and other provisions.</p>
        <p>Supporting the Council law and the campaign board's interpretation is a coalition of longtime advocates of public financing of campaigns: the Citizens Union, City Bar Association, City Club, City Project, Common Cause, League of Women Voters, New York Public Interest Research Group and Women's City Club.</p>
        <p>Those groups argue that if the Mayor tampers with the fourfold match, he will undermine the effort to curb the role of corporate money. They also contend that nothing in the charter panel's sessions or in the Mayor's veto message on the Council plan suggested that his proposal would negate the fourfold match.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely a cheap shot and a very distorted misinterpretation of the election,'' said Gene Russianoff, a senior lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''I don't think the charter commission intended to knock out the four-to-one match, and I don't think the Council will sit idly by while the Mayor tries to kill the centerpiece of its reform. Peter Vallone, who has always been an advocate of campaign finance reform, just finished an election where he was outspent 20 to 1, and now it's a passion.''</p>
        <p>Speaker Vallone said he was willing to discuss the issue with the Mayor.</p>
