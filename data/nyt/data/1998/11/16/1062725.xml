        <p>Taking a cue from Duke, which it is expected to rival for supremacy in men's college basketball this season, UConn today also posted an opening-game rout over a school from the state of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Duke, which was ranked first in the preseason Associated Press poll, among others, dominated Fairfield, 98-66, in Durham, N.C. This afternoon, Connecticut, ranked second in the A.P. poll but first in several others, trounced Quinnipiac, 102-60, before a capacity crowd of 10,027 at the Gampel Pavilion.</p>
        <p>Quinnipiac -- a school of 3,500 undergraduate students in Hamden, Conn., near New Haven -- was making its debut in Division I with only two returning starters from a team that finished 4-23 last season in Division II.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the game was not a good gauge of a Connecticut team that returns all five starters and a strong nucleus of reserves, along with a heralded freshman, Edmund Saunders from Waterbury, Conn. Led by the preseason all-America forward Richard Hamilton and the Big East freshman of the year, point guard Khalid El-Amin, who scored 25 and 28 points respectively, the Huskies led by as many as 25 points in the opening half.</p>
        <p>Hamilton, recently recovered from a broken right foot that kept him from playing with the United States national team in the world basketball championships this past summer, hit 8 of 16 shots, including 3 of 6 3-pointers. El-Amin was 3 of 4 from 3-point range on 9-of-12 shooting. The 6-foot-8-inch Saunders, who sat out last year for academic reasons, was impressive in his UConn debut. Playing only 17 minutes, the smooth freshman connected on 6 of 8 shots, mostly from inside, for 12 points and had a game-high 11 rebounds.</p>
        <p>The Huskies outrebounded the visitors, 57-29, and outshot them 46.3 percent to 39 percent.</p>
        <p>Quinnipiac, which is coached by Joe DeSantis, a onetime star player at Tolentine High School in the Bronx and at Fairfield, hurt itself with 27 turnovers, many of them at the outset, when Connecticut employed a fullcourt press. The Braves got off 21 fewer shots than the home team.</p>
        <p>Jim Calhoun, beginning his 13th season as the UConn coach, was generous in his praise of Quinnipiac, which was led by Nate Pondexter's 21 points. ''I was very impressed with Quinnipiac,'' Calhoun said. ''We had the superior size and they were running up against a team that is 10-deep. But they handled the ball well and they attacked our pressure.''</p>
        <p>As for his own team, which went 32-5 last season and reached the round of eight of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, Calhoun had no complaints. ''We played in spurts,'' he said. ''It was a choppy kind of performance. But I'm not disappointed.''</p>
        <p>Arkansas 83, Jackson St. 72</p>
        <p>Derek Hood scored 4 straight points and grabbed a couple of big rebounds in the final three minutes as No. 19 Arkansas opened the season with a victory at Fayetteville, Ark. Jackson State (0-2) closed to 71-67 with 2:43 to play and had a chance to make it closer. But Vincent Jones missed a free throw and Hood rebounded. At the other end, Hood backed in and turned to his right for a basket. Hood then rebounded another Tiger miss and made two free throws. Hood finished with 18 points and 15 rebounds.</p>

        <p>Tennessee 91, Tenn. St. 69</p>
        <p>Isiah Victor scored 17 points and No. 9 Tennessee rebounded from a 1-point loss two nights earlier to down Tennessee State in Knoxville. Charles Hathaway scored 15 points, C. J. Black 14, Brandon Wharton 13, and Vincent Yarbrough and Rashard Lee each had 11 for the Volunteers (1-1). The Tigers (0-1) were led by Jamie Roberts with 22 points and Demario Jones with 21.</p>
        <p>Tennessee lost to No. 18 Arizona on Friday night in Albuquerque, N.M., in the Black Coaches Association Classic when it shot 36 percent from the floor and allowed Arizona to shoot 53 percent.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Vols hit 30 of 61 from the floor (49 percent), including 17 of 28 (61 percent) in the second half.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>Ohio St. 78, Alabama 70</p>
        <p>Michael Redd scored all but 2 of his 17 points in the second half and had 4 points and a steal in the final 1:06 as Ohio State beat Alabama in the dedication game of its Value City Arena.</p>
