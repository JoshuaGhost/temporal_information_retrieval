        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met the wife of a jailed Malaysian political leader here today in a gesture of solidarity that angered her hosts and suggested that politics could swamp economics at a meeting of Asian and Pacific Rim countries.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Albright talked briefly with Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the wife of Anwar Ibrahim, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, who was imprisoned in September and is on trial for corruption and sex-related charges.</p>
        <p>Shortly afterward, she had a caustic public exchange with Malaysia's Minister of Trade, Rafidah Aziz, about Mr. Anwar's treatment. ''The reporting on the trial of Anwar Ibrahim has given us great concern,'' Mrs. Albright said at a news conference with other ministers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rafidah responded that Mr. Anwar would get a fair trial, adding, ''Maybe when I go to the States, I would like to meet Ken Starr,'' referring to the independent prosecutor who is investigating President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''He's not in jail,'' Mrs. Albright replied brusquely, to the surprise of hundreds of reporters who had turned up to hear an announcement of a new trade agreement involving the 21 countries at the meeting.</p>
        <p>The ministers did announce a trade deal, though it fell far short of the sweeping agreement to lower tariffs that many countries were seeking. Stymied by opposition from Japan, the countries agreed to reconsider the proposals, which would lower tariffs in nine major industries, at the World Trade Organization. That basically puts off the drive for free trade in Asia until 1999.</p>
        <p>Today's compromise was a fitting conclusion to a chaotic opening weekend at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which ends Wednesday. With restive crowds outside, rancorous exchanges inside and a conspicuously absent guest from the United States, the gathering seemed anything but cooperative.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said on Saturday that he would skip the meeting to monitor the Iraq crisis from Washington. While Mrs. Albright participated in the talks today, she cut short her visit to return to Washington on Monday.</p>
        <p>Malaysia's political turmoil flared up on the streets, too, as 200 demonstrators marched at the base of the Petronas Towers, the twin skyscrapers that are the world's tallest buildings. The crowd chanted slogans against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until riot police dispersed them with tear gas and a water cannon.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Dr. Mahathir criticized foreign visitors for using the APEC meeting as an excuse to meddle in Malaysia's internal affairs. His comments came after Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, met with Mr. Anwar's wife.</p>
        <p>Officials were more diplomatic in their assessment of the trade agreement. But it was clear that many were deflated by the outcome. ''I wouldn't say the talks collapsed, but we're disappointed,'' said Sergio Marchi, Canada's Minister for International Trade.</p>
        <p>Japan steadfastly refused to lower tariffs in its fishing and forestry industries. Japan's Trade and Industry Minister, Kaoru Yosano, said Japan had not been able to mobilize domestic support for the cuts in fishing and forestry tariffs. But he held open the chance of doing so.</p>
        <p>''Don't confuse what is happening at APEC with what will happen at the W.T.O.,'' Mr. Yosano told reporters.</p>
