        <p>At the request of President Clinton, the ethical implications of creating hybrid human-cow cells were discussed by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission at its meeting yesterday in Miami, but at least in the public portion of their discussion, none of the commissioners voiced concern about the creation of the hybrid cells.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton requested the discussion last week in a letter to the commission's chairman, Dr. Harold Shapiro of Princeton University. Mr. Clinton said he was ''deeply troubled'' by news that Advanced Cell Technology, a small biotechnology company in Worcester, Mass., had created the hybrid cells. The company proposes to use the technique to take any body cell from a patient, return it to its embryonic form and use it to grow any of a variety of body tissues for possible transplant back into the patient.</p>

        <p>At the request of President Clinton, the ethical implications of creating hybrid human-cow cells were discussed by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission at its meeting yesterday in Miami, but at least in the public portion of their discussion, none of the commissioners voiced concern about the creation of the hybrid cells.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton requested the discussion last week in a letter to the commission's chairman, Dr. Harold Shapiro of Princeton University. Mr. Clinton said he was ''deeply troubled'' by news that Advanced Cell Technology, a small biotechnology company in Worcester, Mass., had created the hybrid cells. The company proposes to use the technique to take any body cell from a patient, return it to its embryonic form and use it to grow any of a variety of body tissues for possible transplant back into the patient.</p>
        <p>One advantage of the technique is that the patient would receive tissues made from his own cells. Another is that no cells would be taken from human embryos or fetuses.</p>
        <p>Noting that scientists had been fusing together cells of different origin for years, Dr. David R. Cox of Stanford University, a member of the commission, said, ''We should tell the President there is nothing new in cells fused from different eggs.''</p>
        <p>The hybrid cow-human cells consist of the nucleus of a human cell inserted into a cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed. Factors in the cow egg are thought to make the human cell nucleus revert to its embryonic form. Because the proteins of a cell turn over rapidly, the cow proteins are expected to be rapidly replaced by human proteins. The mitochondria of the cell, however, are likely to remain cowlike, giving rise at least initially to cells that are not wholly human.</p>
        <p>An outside expert who spoke to the commission by telephone, Ralph Brinster, a physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said of the cow-human hybrid cell, ''Most scientists would not regard it as a chimera.'' Chimeras are animals made from the cells of two different individuals by injecting the embryonic cells of one into the embryo of another.</p>
        <p>Making human chimeras is widely regarded as unethical.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael West, the president of Advanced Cell Technology, attended the commission's meeting and was invited speak. In response to questions, he said he did not believe the cells formed in his procedure, called embryonic stem cells, were capable of forming a fetus if transferred to a uterus, something he said he had no intention of doing.</p>
        <p>Asked how he would prevent the technique from being misused, such as in cloning a person, he suggested that the cloning of humans should be made a crime.</p>
        <p>The commission members said they would draft a reply to Mr. Clinton.</p>
