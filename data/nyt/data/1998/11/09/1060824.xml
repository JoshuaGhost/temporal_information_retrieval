        <p>The arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying on a military installation in Cyprus had a comic caper element that immediately raised questions here about whether it was the latest in a series of bungles by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.</p>
        <p>On a more serious level the arrest of two Israeli men in a small fishing village near Larnaca, Cyprus, spotlighted increased regional tensions about the growing security cooperation between Israel and Turkey.</p>
        <p>The two men, Udi Hargov, 27, and Yigal Damary, 49, who claimed to be teachers, were held on suspicion of espionage after the Cypriots said they had been found with a complement of electronic equipment while recording police or military conversations off a sophisticated scanner.</p>
        <p>According to the Cypriots, the men had visited the coastal village, Zygi, which abuts a military camp, twice before in the previous month. The proprietor of a local tavern, Panikos Cristoldo, had been alerted to notify the authorities if they returned. When they did, Mr. Cristodolo turned them in.</p>
        <p>''Something in my heart told me these were spies who had come to hurt my country,'' Mr. Cristoldo told the Israeli daily Maariv. ''Since my intuition never disappoints me, I knew that when the police turned up, they would not go away empty-handed. Everyone in our small village suspected them.''</p>
        <p>Israel's President, Ezer Weizman, traveled to Nicosia just last week to smooth tensions with Cyprus, where the Government is wary of the growing closeness between Israel and Turkey. Cyprus has been in a tense dispute with Turkey since 1974, when Turkish forces seized control of the northern third of the island. Tensions have been aggravated by the Greek Cypriots' recent purchase of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
        <p>''Naturally we are not happy that holders of Israeli passports were involved in something like this,'' said Euripides Euriviades, the Cypriot Ambassador to Israel. ''There is a lot of anxiety back home with what is happening with the ongoing strategic, military relationship between Israel and Turkey. We had the assurances of President Weizman last week that no harm could come to us from this relationship. So the timing of the incident is not great, although we have due process back home and everyone is innocent until proved guilty.''</p>
        <p>Through the 1990's, Turkey and Israel have forged a close strategic relationship. The Israelis have sold military equipment and provided training to the Turks, and the Turks have allowed Israeli military planes to fly over Turkish air space. Before the Turkish Prime Minister visited Israel in early September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel created a political storm by saying the relationship constituted a ''new axis'' in the Middle East. He later retracted that description, saying he had not expressed himself well.</p>
        <p>Writing for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Ron Ben Yishai, a security expert, said the highly publicized arrests were meant to send ''a warning to Israel lest it decide to provide Turkey with any intelligence or military assistance in its fight against Greek Cyprus.''</p>
        <p>Ambassador Euriviades said the Cypriots would probably charge the two with espionage within the week. Spying is punishable by a maximum sentence of 10 years.</p>
        <p>But it remained unclear today whom -- if anyone -- the two Israelis represented. Some intelligence experts theorized that they were working directly for the Turks, who have vowed to block the imminent delivery of the new surface-to-air missiles. The Cypriots fear that the Israelis have trained Turkish pilots in sophisticated interception techniques.</p>
        <p>The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions, and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such a mission.</p>
        <p>The previous visit had coincided with a Greek-Cypriot military exercise off the coast, the Cypriot authorities said. The Israelis' activities raised suspicions, and when they returned, Cypriot officials obtained a search warrant for their temporary apartment, and said they had found cameras, maps, two scanners and tapes of Greek conversations between police or military officials.</p>
        <p>''There is no doubt that based on the information that we have, they came for the purpose of spying on the Republic of Cyprus and specifically the National Guard,'' Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for the Larnaca district, told a court.</p>
        <p>The Israeli press today used the occasion to recount all Mossad's most recent blunders. They included an incident earlier this year, when five Mossad agents were caught trying to bug a house in Bern, Switzerland. That same week, the Mossad director resigned over a bungled attempt to assassinate a Hamas official in Jordan last fall.</p>
