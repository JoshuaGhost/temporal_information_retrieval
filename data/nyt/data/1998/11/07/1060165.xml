        <p>Valery Gradow, violinist, and students  Weill Recital Hall</p>
        <p>It was an odd little occasion. Valery Gradow, violin professor at the Manneim-Heidelberg Conservatory in Germany, had arrived with a group of past and present students to offer a tiny audience some glimpses of prowess achieved and in the making.</p>
        <p>Much the best playing on Monday night, inevitably, came from the past student, Christian Ostertag. He and his regular accompanist, Fritz Schwinghammer, performed with liveliness and presence. Messiaen's early Theme and Variations was beautifully done: sweet, strong and sure. Schubert's C Major Fantasy was excellent too. Mr. Schwinghammer provided a magical and tantalizing introduction to this glorious piece, and Mr. Ostertag entered with a fine feeling for the scale of the work and of the auditorium. They were both graceful and musical, involved and involving.</p>
        <p>Of the younger players, Birgit Erz was a bit stiff and cold in Beethoven's Sonata (Op. 12, No. 3), again with Mr. Schwinghammer accompanying. She needs to realize she can possess her music. Henja Frauke Semmler, with her brother Tido at the piano, gave a lucid account of Schoenberg's late Fantasy, scurrying from one mood to another clearly and directly. She also showed her virtuoso potential in Efrem Zimbalist's Fantasy on themes from Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Golden Cockerel.''</p>
        <p>Kaoru Minamiguchi, a slightly older and musically more mature student, gave a completely confident performance of Ysaye's Sixth Sonata for solo violin and also led Ms. Erz through the high jinks of Sarasate's ''Navarra'' for two violins and piano.</p>
