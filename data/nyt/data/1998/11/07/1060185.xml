        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Israeli Diplomat Urges Vatican to Delay Beatification of Pius XII'' (news article, Nov. 5): In my judgment, Ambassador Aharon Lopez's proposal was benign and urged only greater sensitivity for the feelings of victims of German terror during World War II. While some Roman Catholics might conceivably see this as interference in church matters, it was the response of the Rev. Peter Gumpel, who is directing the beatification effort, that was troubling. You quote him as saying ''these attacks and insults by some groups are counterproductive. I would not be surprised if it led to a rise of anti-Semitic feeling.''</p>

        <p>If anti-Semitism was not already a factor, statements like the Israeli Ambassador's would not give rise to it. A vigorous debate need not result in expressions of hatred, only differences of opinion.</p>
