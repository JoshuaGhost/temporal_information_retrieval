        <p>Many will recall the complaint of Lewis Carroll's young man: ''You are old, Father William . . . and yet you incessantly stand on your head. Do you think, at your age, it is right?''</p>
        <p>Bridge experts frequently stand on their heads, in a technical way, if they are convinced that a normal vertical posture offers no hope. An example is the diagramed deal, with Roger Stern in the South position. Like Father William he is old, but only in the sense of bridge seniority: his major bridge accomplishments were in the 1960's and 70's, and he is now retired from serious play.</p>

        <p>Many will recall the complaint of Lewis Carroll's young man: ''You are old, Father William . . . and yet you incessantly stand on your head. Do you think, at your age, it is right?''</p>
        <p>Bridge experts frequently stand on their heads, in a technical way, if they are convinced that a normal vertical posture offers no hope. An example is the diagramed deal, with Roger Stern in the South position. Like Father William he is old, but only in the sense of bridge seniority: his major bridge accomplishments were in the 1960's and 70's, and he is now retired from serious play.</p>
        <p>The deal was played Thursday night during the annual expert-member night of the Harmonie Club, 4 East 60th Street. Stern and his wife, Sandy, finished second in the expert category, behind Gail Greenberg and this writer. Member-guest winners were Mickey Greenbaum and Richard Ferrelli.</p>
        <p>The normal contract for North-South is four spades, which is doomed by the location of the missing trump honors. Three no-trump is an inferior alternative, which was reached when North failed to insist on spades after the fit in that suit had been uncovered.</p>
        <p>A heart was led, and South inspected the dummy in some gloom. The chance of making nine tricks was poor, and success was likely to be a failure: 400 for making three no-trump would be useless in match-point terms if other North-South pairs were collecting 420 in four spades.</p>
        <p>The heart lead was ducked, and East won with the king and returned the four. West's queen was taken with the ace, and South thought it over. He then decided to stand on his head and make a totally abnormal play: a club from dummy to the queen.</p>
        <p>This was obviously against the odds and risked a heavy defeat, but South recognized that his cause was hopeless if West held a top club honor. The defense would surely be able to take three heart tricks and at least two club tricks. Dummy's heart ten was a stopper if East was on lead.</p>
        <p>When East played low and the queen won, South was in business. He ran four diamond winners reaching this ending:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>On the last diamond a heart was thrown from the dummy and East gave up the club six. Now a club was led, forcing East to win and give dummy two spade tricks at the finish. The game was made for a top score, since the normal result was down one in four spades.</p>
        <p>East missed two chances. Taking the top clubs when the suit was led, with a third round of clubs to follow, would have been effective. So would a discard of a top club in the diagramed position. But even those defenses would have allowed South to make eight tricks for an average score.</p>
        <p>Standing on one's head can impress the gallery, but most of the time the result will be painful. Be warned.</p>
