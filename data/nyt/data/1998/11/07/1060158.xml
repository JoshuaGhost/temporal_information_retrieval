        <p>What is Henry J. Hyde up to?</p>
        <p>On the one hand, the Illinois Republican who heads the House Judiciary Committee moved on Thursday to wrap up the impeachment inquiry quickly by naming only one witness, the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Hyde fired off a pointed letter asking President Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath, tampered with witnesses or obstructed justice. If Mr. Clinton objects to any of the 81 findings drawn from Mr. Starr's 445-page report, as surely he will, the investigation could drag into next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hyde's letter was clearly a  maneuver to shift the onus to the President and set him up as uncooperative, one Republican aide said.</p>
        <p>''It was for political gain,'' the aide said. ''It's a gamble, a calculated risk. It makes it look like the White House is obstructing.''</p>
        <p>The combative missive might have made political sense for Mr. Hyde before the midterm elections, when House Republicans expected to pad their majority in the next Congress by at least 10 to 15 seats. But after Tuesday's stunning gains for Democrats, and the prospect of a slimmer Republican majority voting on impeachment next year, the tactic seemed confrontational.</p>
        <p>The disjointed approach stemmed in part from bad timing. Mr. Hyde had intended for weeks to seek confirmation of selected facts in the Starr report from Mr. Clinton to spare the committee the time-consuming process of deposing witnesses and holding hearings.</p>
        <p>The White House, for its part, is content to watch the apparent confusion at the committee quietly from the sidelines. Gregory B. Craig, the White House's coordinator of impeachment strategy, said the President's lawyers would respond quickly to the requests for information.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Craig and other top White House officials had little else to say about the matter this week. They have settled on a strategy of portraying the President as hard at work on substantive issues like Social Security and health care while professing equanimity about the impeachment process on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''I have nothing to say about it,'' Mr. Clinton said on Thursday. ''I want these hearings to be constitutionally fair and expeditious. And at the appropriate time, we will say whatever we intend to say.''</p>
        <p>Privately, however, some White House officials are now expressing confidence that the President will emerge from the impeachment proceedings with a largely symbolic vote of censure -- at the most.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, Mr. Hyde's inquiry, led by a former Chicago prosecutor, David P. Schippers, has tried to make the best legal case it can against Mr. Clinton. Investigators have insulated themselves from the political maelstrom swirling around them.</p>
        <p>But impeachment is not playing in a courtroom. It is playing in Congress, where the lawmakers who will ultimately decide President Clinton's fate are sensitive to the shifting political ground in a way that Mr. Hyde's prosecutors are not.</p>
        <p>And the conventional wisdom among Democrats and a growing number of Republicans, who now believe the polls they dismissed before the elections, is that impeachment is a political loser.</p>
        <p>''The outcome is all but certain: this thing ain't going anywhere,'' said Representative Mark Sanford, a conservative Republican from South Carolina.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Hyde is in a box. He wants to end the inquiry as soon as possible.  ''If it goes down, it goes down,'' said one of Mr. Hyde's closest aides. ''Henry has no vested interest in any particular outcome.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hyde feels deeply bound to follow the constitutional process to its end, to insure the proceedings have some shred of public credibility and to satisfy the Republican Party's conservative base .</p>
        <p>Mr. Hyde has also dismissed the idea of short-circuiting the process and censuring Mr. Clinton, and aides say he intends to bring articles of impeachment to a vote in the committee and the full House. But a group of 10 moderate Democrats and Republicans on the committee will meet as early as Sunday to discuss alternative punishments.</p>
        <p>Calling Mr. Starr to testify on Nov. 19 is a gamble for both parties. A Republican aide familiar with the proceedings said the reason for summoning Mr. Starr as a witness, despite the Republican's reluctance two weeks ago, was twofold. Some members believe that Mr. Starr will help their case.</p>
        <p>''Hyde feels Starr is a very credible person and much maligned,'' said another Republican aide. ''He thinks when the American people see he doesn't have horns and a tail, he'll be credible. But it's no slam dunk for either side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr's popularity rating is so low it can only go up, and that should take some of the heat off Republicans on the committee. Besides, many Republicans thought there was no way around calling Mr. Starr since he was the one person many Democrats seemed intent on calling.</p>
        <p>Democrats are torn over whether to call for additional witnesses. Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts says it is unthinkable to make a judgment without calling major witnesses.</p>
        <p>But other Democrats, who believe impeachment is dead, are advising against it. Why aggravate the process? they ask. ''If this is what gets us to closure, then why intrude?'' a Democratic aide familiar with the proceedings said.</p>
        <p>Representative Zoe Lofgren of California said she saw business as usual. Ms. Lofgren is one Democrat who believed that calling Mr. Starr was a waste of time since he had not been a witness to anything. And if Republicans wind up dragging the whole thing into next year, they will be shooting themselves in the foot again, she argued.</p>
        <p>''The elections have not changed the majority's approach at all,'' Ms. Lofgren said. ''The President said it should be fair, constitutional and expeditious. Well, all I see is expeditious. I don't see fair and constitutional. There are a lot of things that are quick. A lynching is quick.''</p>
        <p>Many Democrats are convinced that Mr. Hyde is trying to find a graceful exit.</p>
        <p>''They are trying to figure out how to fold their tent as quickly as they can without looking like they are folding tent,'' a Democratic official said.</p>
