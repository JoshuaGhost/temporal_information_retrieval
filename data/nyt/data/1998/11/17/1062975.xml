        <p>In Iraq's capitulation the burden of finding the arms sites and proving the existence of weapons remains with the United Nations Special Commission (''Iraq Offers Steps to Avoid Attack; U.S. Rejects Plan,'' front page, Nov. 15).</p>
        <p>What was lost in this agreement was the opportunity to get Iraq to agree to shift the burden of proof back onto Iraq by demanding that it supply a complete list of weapons sites, locations and what was in every site, including exact quantities of biological, lethal gases and other weapons.</p>

        <p>Further, Iraq should have been required to disclose all manufacturing locations and supplies in Iraq and to disclose all foreign sources of such supplies and equipment. Under these conditions Iraq's agreement and credibility could be readily tested with existing intelligence and further verified on the ground in an ongoing manner.</p>
