        <p>THREE years ago, the same pro basketbll superstars who are currently negotiating a luxury tax with David Stern tried to decertify their union after learning their representatives were negotiating a luxury tax with David Stern.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing subverted Simon Gourdine's and Buck Williams's leadership while contesting the very collective bargaining agreement they wish they could now preserve. Now Jordan and Ewing are discovering how much harder it is to run the government than to stage a revolution.</p>
        <p>''It's become obvious now that, except for not raising the minimum salary more, the 1995 deal was an excellent one for the players,'' Williams said from his Greenwich, Conn., home. ''I'm not looking to say, 'I told you so.' I'm not that kind of person. But it's gratifying to hear some of them say, 'Let's get back to the status quo.' ''</p>
        <p>Mostly, what Williams wants to hear is that the locked-out players are getting closer to an equitable deal that would allow him to proceed with the final season of an 18-year National Basketball Association career, possibly not with the Knicks. He roots for an agreement before too many games are lost and too many players are desperate and Billy Hunter, a tough, earnest man he admires, finds himself back on defense, trying to cover his players, not to mention the owners and Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner.</p>
        <p>This would be most unfortunate, said Williams, in a league that is 80 percent black and more than ever needs a strong players' advocate, a voice and ego equal in stature to Stern's. ''Billy was hired because he is competent and intelligent,'' Williams said. ''He also happens to be black, and I think, even if you just look at the history of our own union, black leadership is held to a higher standard. You see it all the time; blacks don't believe that another black man can do for them what a white man can. Race is an issue, a subtext, in this fight.''</p>
        <p>Winning the fight is one thing; losing perspective is another. This is the fine line Hunter walks. Three years ago, Williams couldn't collect dues, much less get players like Jordan and Ewing to stop counting their money and shoot for the union. Now Jordan engages in shouting matches with owners, and only he knows how much of this has been inspired by his ubiquitous agent, David Falk.</p>
        <p>''Michael and Patrick didn't care until Falk told them to get involved,'' Williams said. ''But Billy has done a great job insulating himself with some really big megastars.''</p>
        <p>Hunter won't be immune to what befell Williams, Gourdine and Charles Grantham before them if this goes on much longer. The modern pro basketball player has never ridden fume-filled buses in the minor leagues, or plugged his way through the frozen tundra of junior hockey. He holds poolside news conferences and doesn't recognize the public-relations folly of holding a rank-and-file meeting in Las Vegas. Hunter has to play his cards so that he doesn't put his less-leveraged players in the cash-strapped position to panic, while Stern pontificates and the N.B.A. continues to be perceived as a one-genius league.</p>
        <p>It has been this way since Larry Fleisher ran a tight union ship, in no small part because he doubled as the agent for the league's activist players. Isiah Thomas emerged a decade ago to contest this arrangement, and the union has since been a mix of apathy and anarchy, which only inspires Falk to, as he says, ''roll up his sleeves'' for players at the top end.</p>
        <p>''It's all perception,'' said Williams, remembering how easy it was for Falk to ridicule the 1995 deal that drove the players' percentage of the pie from 52 percent to 57 percent. ''But the result has always been all these white attorneys on both sides, and in the middle you have black players questioning the intelligence of their black union leaders.''</p>
        <p>Even after Jordan and Ewing stepped in to block the first version of the 1995 deal until the luxury tax was removed, Falk and other agents promoted decertifying the union, ultimately losing a vote that was more lopsided than the worst N.B.A. blowout. When Stern locked the players out last July, everyone knew the owners hadn't exercised their contractual right to reopen negotiations over pennies. This union had all summer to explore what it preached last time -- decertification -- and didn't. Hunter knows his constituency is less interested in chasing lawyer-driven dreams in court, more determined to cut a deal and get paid.</p>
        <p>So a milder version of the luxury tax that supposedly meant Armageddon in 1995 went on the table. Hunter said on the radio the other day that he has offered to roll back unrestricted free agency for rookies, following their first contracts, to right-of-first-refusal free agency. Owners would get leverage they should have when dealing with players who demand $100 million for potential, not production.</p>
        <p>''That's a tough one to give back,'' Williams said. Again, three years ago, he was hammered by Falk for simply allowing a rookie wage scale. Ask Kevin Garnett how that agreement worked out. Ask Alonzo Mourning and Allan Houston and, of course, Ewing if Buck Williams's deal was so bad. As Williams said, this is always about point of view, about power, about who gets the biggest payday. Billy Hunter has a chance to alter the perception of who represents all the players, who drives the N.B.A. with Stern. Hunter's window of opportunity is now, or maybe never.</p>
