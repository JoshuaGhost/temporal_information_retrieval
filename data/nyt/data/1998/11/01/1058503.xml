        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I share some of Frank Rich's concerns about the growing clout of corporate America in the theater [''A Detour in the Theater That No One Predicted,'' Oct. 18], his main concern is an old and tired one: that that which is popular (i.e., that which makes money) is of necessity suspect and, most likely, bad; that the only ''important'' work in American theater is being done in underfinanced nonprofit theaters. His main objection to shows like ''Ragtime,'' ''The Lion King,'' and ''Beauty and the Beast'' seems to be simply that they make money while shows that he might admire do not.</p>

        <p>While I share some of Frank Rich's concerns about the growing clout of corporate America in the theater [''A Detour in the Theater That No One Predicted,'' Oct. 18], his main concern is an old and tired one: that that which is popular (i.e., that which makes money) is of necessity suspect and, most likely, bad; that the only ''important'' work in American theater is being done in underfinanced nonprofit theaters. His main objection to shows like ''Ragtime,'' ''The Lion King,'' and ''Beauty and the Beast'' seems to be simply that they make money while shows that he might admire do not.</p>
        <p>The real problem with the American theater lies not with the corporate heavyweights now invading it (who will likely discover the thin bottom lines compared with what they're used to and retreat in short order). The real problem lies with the very people whom Mr. Rich is at such pains to praise. The American theater, to a large extent, has simply forgotten how to work for a living. It has forgotten that its main goal is to entertain. Indeed, it seems to me that many theater ''artists'' are contemptuous of their audiences, as if the thought that some poor slob who works for a living might understand their ''important'' work is anathema to them. Perhaps that's how they justify their failures to themselves.</p>
