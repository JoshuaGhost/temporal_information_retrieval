        <p>It is curious that the same issue in which Andrew Sullivan is allowed 10 pages for fear-mongering about the dangers of moral authoritarianism, Sarah Kerr fills three pages waxing rhapsodic over Barbara Kingsolver (Oct. 11).</p>
        <p>Kingsolver, we learn, is an admirer of Karl Marx who says that ''the scales fell from my eyes'' when she first read his works. Kingsolver further claims that the war in Vietnam ''was rich people somehow protecting their interests'' and that when the war ended, ''I felt very empowered.''</p>

        <p>It is curious that the same issue in which Andrew Sullivan is allowed 10 pages for fear-mongering about the dangers of moral authoritarianism, Sarah Kerr fills three pages waxing rhapsodic over Barbara Kingsolver (Oct. 11).</p>
        <p>Kingsolver, we learn, is an admirer of Karl Marx who says that ''the scales fell from my eyes'' when she first read his works. Kingsolver further claims that the war in Vietnam ''was rich people somehow protecting their interests'' and that when the war ended, ''I felt very empowered.''</p>
        <p>American withdrawal from Vietnam did not end the war there. Within two years, the Hanoi Government violated the Paris treaty and invaded and conquered South Vietnam. While Kingsolver was feeling ''empowered,'' thousands of Vietnamese fled their homeland in rickety boats rather than live under Communist rule.</p>
        <p>And so, while Andrew Sullivan frightens New Yorkers by decrying the speculative evils of moral authoritarianism, readers can turn the page and be comforted to read about an author who embraces authoritarianism of the more familiar amoral variety.</p>
