        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission accused 44 stock promoters of fraudulently promoting more than 235 tiny companies on the Internet. It was the first nationwide sweep of stock fraud on the Web.</p>
        <p>The promoters, mostly little-known individuals working from their homes or for small public relations companies, often touted stocks on Web sites and bulletin boards, and in Internet newsletters. They made recommendations but often failed to disclose that the companies had paid for the promotions, a violation of anti-fraud regulations, the S.E.C. said.</p>
