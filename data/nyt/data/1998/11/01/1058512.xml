        <p>LIKE students who frantically wave their hands so their teachers will notice them, candidates for the General Assembly are vying for voter attention in the closing days of the campaign.</p>
        <p>In any gubernatorial election year, legislative candidates have to work hard to compete for attention with the more widely known candidates for governor, senator and representative.</p>
        <p>But in this unusual year, with projections that the races for governor and senator are all but over, they worry that large numbers of voters may not take notice of any of the other contests on the ballot and simply stay home on Tuesday instead of going to the polls.</p>
        <p>''The tricky thing is to get voters attentive to the fact that next Tuesday there is an election,'' said Donald P. Green, a professor of political science at Yale.</p>
        <p>Not only are Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, seen as winning easy victories, but also none of the candidates in the two races have raised issues that have generated excitement, he said. ''Around these parts, it's very, very drab,'' Mr. Green concluded.</p>
        <p>The polls will be open from 6 A.M. through 8 P.M. in all 169 towns on Tuesday as voters will choose between Mr. Rowland and his Democratic challenger, Barbara B. Kennelly, for Governor, and between Mr. Dodd and his Republican challenger, Gary A. Franks, for United States Senator.</p>
        <p>They will also choose the constitutional officers in the state, commonly referred to as the underticket -- 6 United States Representatives, 36 State Senators, 151 State Representatives, Registrars of Voters in 120 towns, 130 Judges of Probate and county sheriffs, the last vestiges of county government in the state.</p>
        <p>There are no statewide ballot questions, but there are local questions in 40 municipalities, ranging from extending the mayor's term in Bridgeport to four years from two, to approval of a golf course in Bloomfield.</p>
        <p>The latest Quinnipiac College Poll, an independent survey taken Oct. 13 to 19, showed Mr. Rowland with a 48-point lead and Mr. Dodd with a 32-point lead. Howard L. Reiter, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut, said, ''Certainly, if Rowland does any better, he'll carry Rhode Island, too.''</p>
        <p>In the last days of the campaign, candidates are trying to get out the vote with mailings, telephone calls, advertisements and broadcasting commercials, if they can afford them, filling lawns with cardboard signs if they cannot. Following are some of the contests that voters will decide on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>General Assembly</p>
        <p>State Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen, a Stamford Democrat, predicted that neither the impeachment investigation of President Clinton in Washington nor Governor Rowland's projected landslide will have a trickle-down effect on legislative races. Mr. Jepsen added: ''For all the talk about Lewinsky and Clinton, and Rowland winning by a lot, and all the kind of big picture noise, it's settling down, I believe, into a year where the voters are satisfied with the direction of the state and satisfied with the performance of the legislature.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Jepsen's projection, Democrats would retain the majority in  the General Assembly. They currently have a 96-55 majority in the House, and a less lopsided 19-17 majority in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The Deputy Senate Minority Leader William H. Nickerson, a Greenwich Republican, said that Republicans are hoping to add at least one Senate seat, equalizing representation and giving the Republicans an advantage in tie votes, assuming that Mr. Rowland wins. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate and votes in the event of a tie.</p>
        <p>M. Jodi Rell, of Ridgefield, is seeking re-election as Lieutenant Governor and former State Representative Joseph Courtney, of Vernon, is the Democrat running for the post. Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run as a team, with their names in the same slot on the ballot.</p>
        <p>The State Senate race in the 22d District, which includes Trumbull and sections of Bridgeport and Monroe, is being closely watched by both parties. A Democrat, William Finch, a Bridgeport alderman, is waging an aggressive campaign against the incumbent Republican, Angelina Lee Scarpetti, of Trumbull. Two years ago, Mr. Finch ran an unsuccessful, but competitive, campaign against United States Representative Christopher Shays, the Fourth District Republican. Mrs. Scarpetti attracted attention as a senator when she challenged the renomination of Superior Court Judge Leander Gray for not imposing a stricter penalty than a small fine on a man who was convicted of molesting a 4-year-old girl. Mr. Gray ultimately withdrew from consideration for the judgeship. A Libertarian candidate, Carl E. Vassar, is also running for the Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Family connections are attracting attention in the race in the 28th Senate District, which is based in Fairfield. The Republican incumbent, Fred Lovegrove, did not seek re-election. The Democratic candidate, Thomas G. Ganim, a brother of Mayor Joseph Ganim of Bridgeport, is running against John McKinney, son of the deceased Congressman Stewart B. McKinney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ganim, of Easton, who unsuccessfully sought the seat in 1996, criticized Mr. McKinney for his law firm's representation of United States Tobacco in Greenwich and contended that the Republican altered his resume to hide that.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinney, of Fairfield, said that he had done work on behalf of the tobacco company, but denied changing his resume. He also  charged that Mr. Ganim would be more interested in representing Bridgeport, his brother's city, than the suburban senatorial district, which takes in Fairfield, Easton and Newtown. Mr. McKinney has made sure that voters know he is the son of the popular Congressman, who died in 1987. Even his campaign logo closely resembles his father's.</p>
        <p>Another State Senate candidate unintentionally made the same connection when a party letter went to voters mistakenly stating that the Republican, Robert Pero, running in the 20th District in six eastern Connecticut towns is the son of the the elder Mr. McKinney. Timothy A. Longino, legislative director of the Senate Republicans, said that 26,000 people in the New London area received the letter.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, a former Republican State Chairman, Robert S. Poliner, of Durham, has received major labor union endorsements, unusual for a Republican, in his challenge to the incumbent Democratic Senator, Eileen M. Daily, of Westbrook, in the 33d District, which includes 14 towns.</p>
        <p>Underticket</p>
        <p>In the races for the non-gubernatorial statewide offices, widely known as the underticket, there will be a new Secretary of the State.</p>
        <p>The incumbent Democrat, Miles S. Rapoport, opted against seeking re-election, and ran unsuccessfully in a Democratic primary in the First Congressional District.</p>
        <p>State Representative Susan Bysiewicz of Middletown, became the Democratic candidate for Secretary of the State after defeating State Representative Ellen Scalleter of Woodbridge in a primary. Ben Andrews, of Simsbury, former president of the state's N.A.A.C.P. chapter is the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Silvester, the West Hartford Republican who was named treasurer after Christopher B. Burnham resigned, is being challenged by Denise Nappier, a Democrat and the Hartford city treas urer.</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, a Stamford Democrat, is seeking his third term as State Attorney General. His Republican opponent is Santa Mendoza, a lawyer with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.</p>
        <p>In the race for State Comptroller, the Democratic incumbent, Nancy S. Wyman, of Tolland, is being challenged by Christopher Scalzo, a Republican State Representative from Ridgefield.</p>
        <p>There are minor party candidates in all of the underticket races and in many of the other statewide and district contests.</p>
        <p>Senate and Governor</p>
        <p>The United States Senate and gubernatorial races have not been competitive from the start, according to most polls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, the Yale political science professor, said that ''the complete collapse of the Kennelly campaign has removed that campaign from view and the complete collapse of the Franks campaign has removed that campaign from view. So, the two most prominent elections are as dull as they can possibly be.''</p>
        <p>In the latest Quinnipiac poll, just 27 percent of respondents said they were ''paying a lot of attention'' to the campaigns while 68 percent found them ''dull.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, of Waterbury, a former Congressman in the Fifth District, has criticized Mr. Dodd's attendance record in Congress and his travels out of state while serving as general chairman of the national Democratic party. Mr. Franks supports a flat tax to replace the Federal income tax, as well as a Constitutional amendment banning flag burning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodd, who is seeking a fourth six-year-term, has said that health, education, the economy and crime are the issues, not him. One of his major successes was the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new baby or ailing relative.</p>
        <p>He has far outspent Mr. Franks, who, in 1996, lost his bid for a fourth term in Congress to James Maloney, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>In the gubernatorial race, Mr. Rowland said he has cut taxes more than any governor in state history, and cited welfare changes, four budget surpluses and increased aid to cities as other accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kennelly's campaign theme has stressed that there are two Connecticuts -- the prosperous and the  needy, particularly the elderly residents being deserted by health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>She has been the United States Representative from the First District in the Hartford area since 1982 and previously served as Secretary of the State on the Hartford City Council.</p>
        <p>Congress</p>
        <p>The campaign to succeed Mrs. Kennelly in the First Congressional District, is the only House race in Connecticut in which an incumbent is not running. The Democratic candidate, John B. Larson of East Hartford, a former leader of the State Senate, is facing Kevin J. O'Connor of Wethersfield, a Republican.</p>
        <p>In other Congressional races drawing interest from national campaign organizations of both parties, Mr. Maloney, a Danbury Democrat, is facing State Senator Mark Nielsen, a Danbury Republican, in the Fifth District, which includes Danbury, Waterbury and Meriden.</p>
        <p>In the Sixth District in the northwestern section of the state, Nancy L. Johnson, a New Britain Republican, is being challenged by Charlotte G. Koskoff of Plainville, who narrowly lost a race with Mrs. Johnson two years ago.</p>
