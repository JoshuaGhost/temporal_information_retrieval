        <p>TIMPSON-Eleanor Rosemary of Essex Fells, N.J. and Chatham, MA. With great sadness her family mourns her death on October 22, 1998. Rosemary was born in Orange, N.J. on May 16th, 1911. She attended Vassar College, where she was involved with the Vassar Experimental Theatre. After graduation, she studied landscape design at Radcliffe College, and continued her interest in Theatre as a lighting specialist. Rosemary was married in 1940 to her husband, James Timpson, a Montclair architect, with whom she had two children, Anne Timpson Fuglestad and James L. Timpson. She is survived by her three brothers, Roger B. Charlesworth, Robert E. Charlesworth, Richard L. Charlesworth, two grandchildren, one nephew and many nieces. Her professional life of fifty years as an interior designer leaves behind a rich visual tribute to her talents. For fifteen years she opened a seasonal museum and shop in Chatham, MA, called the ''Ten O'clock Scholar''. During World War II, Rosemary served as canteen chairman in the Red Cross caring for wounded soldiers. Her generous contributions of time and service to Vassar Club of Essex County, Essex Fells School, Essex Fells Garden Club and St. Peter's Opportunity Shop, where she volunteered for forty-three years, will not be forgotten. She gave generous gifts, her time, and her creativity to many museums, sharing a great love and knowledge of social history. These include the Montclair Art Museum, where she curated and designed three exhibitions, The Crane House, where she restored the Revere room, The Toy and Miniature Museum of Kansas City, The New Jersey Historical Society, S.P.N.E.A. and The Peabody Museum, where resides her gift of a 12 ft. riggers model, the U.S.S. Pennsylvania. She was loving and compassionate to her family and friends and will be remembered for her warmth, humor and grace.</p>
