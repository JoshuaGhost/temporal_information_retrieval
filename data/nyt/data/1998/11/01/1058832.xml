        <p>Every so often, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin comes right out and says it. No subtlety. No beating around the bush.</p>
        <p>He wants to be President. Or Vice President. Either one.</p>
        <p>Speaking the other day to the Madison Rotary Club, Mr. Thompson, a Republican and champion talker, toyed with the possibility of running for higher office as a cat would toy with a ball of yarn.</p>
        <p>Yes, he said, he would like to run for President in 2000. But no, he added, he would not.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>It would take at least $25 million just to get started, he said, and that was more than he could raise. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the oft-mentioned possible Republican Presidential candidate, could easily raise that much, Mr. Thompson went on, and the pity of that, he lamented, was that Tommy Thompson would be ''as good, if not better'' a candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson's appearance before the Rotarians was ostensibly to campaign for votes for a record fourth term. But his political heart and ego were in his talk of higher office and he apparently figured he could get away with it, since polls have him running ahead of his Democratic challenger, Ed Garvey.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' he said, ''if somebody asked me to be their running mate, I think everybody in this room would say I'd be crazy not to consider it. I will consider it. I think it absolutely is a compliment to the State of Wisconsin that somebody has the opportunity to be considered to run for President of the United States, or be considered as the candidate for Vice President.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garvey later said that all he could think about, let alone consider, was Tuesday's gubernatorial race.</p>
