        <p>Romanesca  Weill Recital Hall</p>
        <p>Andrew Manze must have seemed like some exotic weed when he sprouted a few years ago in the impeccably tended garden of early music in London. By now, Mr. Manze seems to be carrying much of the London early-music scene with him into adventure, as associate director of the Academy of Ancient Music and violinist in the crack chamber group Romanesca, which made its New York debut on Wednesday evening under the auspices of the increasingly valuable Gotham Early Music Foundation.</p>
        <p>Noting in extended remarks from the stage that a sonata by Biaggio Marini from 1629 carried the first example of double-stopping in print, Mr. Manze voiced his suspicion that since publishers would have been slow to adopt a technique difficult to print as well as to play, double-stopping had probably been in use for some time. So double-stopping, the obvious implication was, should be fair game in earlier music as well, a typically imaginative reading of the evidence that little more than a decade ago might have been branded as heresy in a London scene replete with literalistic note spinners.</p>

        <p>Romanesca  Weill Recital Hall</p>
        <p>Andrew Manze must have seemed like some exotic weed when he sprouted a few years ago in the impeccably tended garden of early music in London. By now, Mr. Manze seems to be carrying much of the London early-music scene with him into adventure, as associate director of the Academy of Ancient Music and violinist in the crack chamber group Romanesca, which made its New York debut on Wednesday evening under the auspices of the increasingly valuable Gotham Early Music Foundation.</p>
        <p>Noting in extended remarks from the stage that a sonata by Biaggio Marini from 1629 carried the first example of double-stopping in print, Mr. Manze voiced his suspicion that since publishers would have been slow to adopt a technique difficult to print as well as to play, double-stopping had probably been in use for some time. So double-stopping, the obvious implication was, should be fair game in earlier music as well, a typically imaginative reading of the evidence that little more than a decade ago might have been branded as heresy in a London scene replete with literalistic note spinners.</p>
        <p>The performances here, with Nigel North, Romanesca's founder, on theorbo and John Toll on harpsichord, were gritty and compelling. Mr. Manze himself was a marvel, at times turning a halting ornamentation into exalted speech, as in a sonata by Giovanni Paolo Cima; at others using his bow virtually as a paintbrush, as in a sonata by Biber.</p>
        <p>Mr. North and Mr. Toll each played eloquent solo numbers, the only way to get out from the shadow of Mr. Manze's blinding virtuosity.</p>
