        <p>Early in ''The Story Goes On,'' a sadly undernourished little show surveying the music of David Shire and his lyric collaborator, Richard Maltby Jr., the singer Loni Ackerman, who performs most of the material with Mr. Shire accompanying her on the piano, speaks of ''honing my craft.'' This sort of thudding cliche, alas, is what passes for patter in the revue, which opened a three-week engagement at the Kaufman Theater, 534 West 42d Street in Clinton, on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>There is certainly a story to be told of the Maltby-Shire collaboration, which reached an artistic peak in the 1980's with the Broadway musical ''Baby'' and the Off Broadway revue ''Closer Than Ever.'' But you won't find it here. Ms. Ackerman and Mr. Shire also happen to share a history, the singer having appeared in the original cast of the 1977 Maltby-Shire revue ''Starting Here, Starting Now.'' But that history remains unexplored.</p>

        <p>Early in ''The Story Goes On,'' a sadly undernourished little show surveying the music of David Shire and his lyric collaborator, Richard Maltby Jr., the singer Loni Ackerman, who performs most of the material with Mr. Shire accompanying her on the piano, speaks of ''honing my craft.'' This sort of thudding cliche, alas, is what passes for patter in the revue, which opened a three-week engagement at the Kaufman Theater, 534 West 42d Street in Clinton, on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>There is certainly a story to be told of the Maltby-Shire collaboration, which reached an artistic peak in the 1980's with the Broadway musical ''Baby'' and the Off Broadway revue ''Closer Than Ever.'' But you won't find it here. Ms. Ackerman and Mr. Shire also happen to share a history, the singer having appeared in the original cast of the 1977 Maltby-Shire revue ''Starting Here, Starting Now.'' But that history remains unexplored.</p>
        <p>Comic topical songs of the sort the Maltby-Shire team have always specialized in require a light touch and the invention of characters to make them come fully alive. But at Tuesday's opening night performance, Mr. Shire's ponderous, overbearing piano accompaniments threatened to drown out Ms. Ackerman's singing. His songs may be many things, but they're not Beethoven sonatas.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Ackerman has a bright, chirpy voice well suited to the show's lighter material, she failed to invest it with much personality. On ballads, like the revue's gorgeous title song describing the joyous side of pregnancy, her voice was too shrill and strained to convey the song's mysticism. When Mr. Shire, who can hardly sing at all, joined her for a duet on ''It Goes Like It Goes,'' his lovely Academy Award-winning hit from the movie ''Norma Rae,'' the discrepancy between the voices and the material was almost painful.</p>
