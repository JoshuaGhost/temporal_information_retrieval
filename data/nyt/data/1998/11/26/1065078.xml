        <p>TELEPHONES used to be more predictable. They were generally tethered securely to a wall, and when they rang, well, they rang. Today, telephones are adrift, floating like dandelion seeds throughout the environment, and they don't ring. They warble.</p>
        <p>Lately, the cunning little mobile phones that people like to carry -- the ones that also send E-mail and receive stock market quotations -- have been emitting more elaborate sounds. During a recent lunch in a Berlin restaurant, for instance, one of my companions suddenly had what sounded like an especially squeaky Brandenburg Concerto emanating from his pocket. It was his mobile phone.</p>

        <p>TELEPHONES used to be more predictable. They were generally tethered securely to a wall, and when they rang, well, they rang. Today, telephones are adrift, floating like dandelion seeds throughout the environment, and they don't ring. They warble.</p>
        <p>Lately, the cunning little mobile phones that people like to carry -- the ones that also send E-mail and receive stock market quotations -- have been emitting more elaborate sounds. During a recent lunch in a Berlin restaurant, for instance, one of my companions suddenly had what sounded like an especially squeaky Brandenburg Concerto emanating from his pocket. It was his mobile phone.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Finnish company Nokia and the Swedish company Ericsson sell phones that offer a wide selection of programmed musical rings -- from a Scott Joplin rag to ''Auld Lang Syne'' -- but you don't hear these melodic snippets very often in the United States. Not yet, anyway. In some European countries, where upward of 40 percent of the population is equipped with a mobile phone (compared with 23 percent here), there is greater need for a distinctive ring. At least, that's the simple explanation.</p>
        <p>The very newest mobile phones allow owners to program favorite tunes or original compositions. The brightly colored Ericsson CF 768 is packaged with a chart that assigns musical notes to each button on the key pad, and explains how to produce sharps, flats and rests.</p>
        <p>Following instructions found on an independent Web site run by a 21-year-old Australian computer programmer (www.nogi.net), a repository of hundreds of songs specially arranged to be played on the Ericsson, I punched in a tinsely version of Herb Alpert's ''Tijuana Taxi.'' It's an arduous process, and at the end, I felt strangely satisfied, as if I had mastered a piano etude.</p>
        <p>Beyond helping mobile-phone owners to pick out their ring in a crowd, the individualized, anthemic sound is a way of humanizing a technological device. ''A cellular phone is a personal product,'' reasoned Gary Dorfner, a senior product line manager for Ericsson. ''You want to create an affinity with the users, so they say, 'Hey, this is my phone.' ''</p>
        <p>Ben Rubin, who teaches a course called Sonic Design at New York University's interactive telecommunications program and who has designed a system that would replace the electronic bleeps of the New York subway's turnstiles with more pleasing musical sounds, doesn't think the music played by mobile phones is any kind of improvement.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to hear the 'William Tell' Overture when my phone is ringing,'' he said. Mr. Rubin does, however, concur with the Ericsson marketers about the significance of distinctive rings. ''I want my ring to be short, quiet, complex and uniquely mine,'' he declared, ''an expression of my taste.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin believes that the existing sounds are ''too primitive to fulfill my desires.'' But then, he hasn't heard the latest from Finland.</p>
        <p>''The annoyance of ringing mobile phones in public places has been discussed a lot in Finland,'' said two Nokia technologists, Seppo Helle, a user-interface software designer, and Outi Kortevaara, an audio specialist, who replied jointly to questions I sent to them by E-mail. ''The issue may be here more acute since Finland currently has the largest mobile phone penetration in the world -- over 50 percent.''</p>
        <p>Nokia is about to introduce a mobile phone, the 9110, with rings that Mr. Helle and Ms. Kortevaara say are ''softer and cleaner,'' thanks to improved speaker technology. It will, they add, produce natural sounds, not cheap electronic imitations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Helle sent along a file of two dozen surprising new ringer noises. Some are musical: a classical guitar piece, played on a real guitar that retains much of its natural resonance, and an intentionally fuzzy rock guitar solo. Some are funny: a human voice imitating the b-r-r-ring of a telephone ring. Undoubtedly these sounds, refreshing on the first listen, will quickly become a form of noise pollution. But all of them -- with the possible exception of a long, horsy laugh -- are far less irritating than any existing ring.</p>
        <p>One more thing: Mr. Dorfner spoke to me from his own cellular phone. He told me he had adjusted his phone to emit ''a quiet little beep,'' because he was attending a gathering of Ericsson executives. If everyone in the room had their ringer programmed to play ''Stairway to Heaven'' or the theme from ''Star Wars,'' well, you can imagine.</p>
