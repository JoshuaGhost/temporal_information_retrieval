        <p>Stanley Tucci delivers a high-energy charge as Walter Winchell in tonight's fast-breathing account of the sensational rise and abrupt decline of America's pioneering gossip columnist. And in sharp glimpses along the way, Paul Mazursky's movie digs into the connection between popular-front patriotism of the 1930's and 40's and the right-wing populism of the brief-lived but powerfully disruptive McCarthy era.</p>
        <p>There's smoky atmosphere in abundance here, from the Stork Club, where Winchell lorded over press agents and sycophants, to the barber shop where his cadre of ghostwriters sweated to come up with Winchell-type cracks (intellectual smart alecks were written off as ''brain pains''), to the Manhattan hotel room where Winchell disported while his wife raised the family back home in Westchester. Glenne Headly, as his favorite chanteuse, drops by frequently for a quickie until her name shows up on some sort of left-wing petition.</p>

        <p>Stanley Tucci delivers a high-energy charge as Walter Winchell in tonight's fast-breathing account of the sensational rise and abrupt decline of America's pioneering gossip columnist. And in sharp glimpses along the way, Paul Mazursky's movie digs into the connection between popular-front patriotism of the 1930's and 40's and the right-wing populism of the brief-lived but powerfully disruptive McCarthy era.</p>
        <p>There's smoky atmosphere in abundance here, from the Stork Club, where Winchell lorded over press agents and sycophants, to the barber shop where his cadre of ghostwriters sweated to come up with Winchell-type cracks (intellectual smart alecks were written off as ''brain pains''), to the Manhattan hotel room where Winchell disported while his wife raised the family back home in Westchester. Glenne Headly, as his favorite chanteuse, drops by frequently for a quickie until her name shows up on some sort of left-wing petition.</p>
        <p>Based on ''Walter Winchell: His Life and Times,'' by Herman Klurfeld (played earnestly by Paul Giamatti), for 30 years Winchell's main wordsmith, pardon the expression, the two-hour biography speeds along from young Walter's hustling beginnings as a tabloid gossip merchant (''I'm not writing for the major leagues,'' he announces. ''I'm writing for the minor leagues.'') to his ascendance as the nation's most powerful propagandist.</p>
        <p>It's a busy show, and Mr. Tucci carries it along at a vigorous pace. Off with the jacket, on with the hat, and his collection of titillating tidbits, snappy put-downs, uninhibited opinions and random claptrap went clicketing out to Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.</p>
        <p>In his heyday Winchell was the perfect representative of what had not yet been elevated to ''the media.'' He was streetwise and unfastidious, made for the bottom feeders at the Hearst chain; fast-talking and secret-baring, made for the new growth industry of radio. Mr. Tucci understands that this sentimental tough guy won his fans' trust not by pretending to be superior to them but by making sure they recognized him as one of their own, a guy who was on their side against the big shots whom he mocked and exposed even as he slavered over them.</p>
        <p>With the approach of World War II, Winchell was a premature anti-Nazi. As a Jew, that came naturally, even though it meant defying his isolationist Hearst bosses. And he was also susceptible to the charms of Franklin D. Roosevelt, shrewdly interpreted here by Christopher Plummer. Winchell, the people's tribune, loved to be on intimate terms with the movers and shakers of a smoother class.</p>
        <p>After Roosevelt's death and Hitler's defeat, Winchell's patriotism took a paranoid turn. His hour had run out, along with the sort of tabloids and radio shows that had nurtured him. Yet in today's cable and Internet rant, one can still detect the influence of the prototypical ranter.</p>
        <p>The farewell glimpse of him tonight is post-journalism, when he returned to his early vaudeville days and did a turn as a Las Vegas hoofer. Mr. Tucci goes gamely, even stylishly, through the routine; it's a big change from his decades of influence but not out of character.</p>
        <p>WINCHELL  HBO, tonight at 8</p>
        <p>Written by Scott Abbott, based on the book ''Walter Winchell: His Life and Times'' by Herman Klurfeld; Paul Mazursky, director; Rich Zinman, co-executive producer; Rob Fried, executive producer. An HBO Pictures Presentation of a Paul Mazursky Film; a Fried Films Production.</p>

Roosevelt), Glenne Headly (Dallas Wayne), Xander Berkeley (Gavreau), Mary Portser (Janet Winchell), Jeremy Blackman (Walter Winchell, age 8), Raffi Di Blascio (Walter Winchell, age 20), John O'Donohue (Harry, the doorman), Michael Greene (Bellamy) and Megan Mullally (June Winchell).</p>
