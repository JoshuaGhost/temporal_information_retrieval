        <p>Allan Kozinn reviews recital by pianist Maurizio Pollini at Carnegie Hall; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At his recital at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening, the pianist Maurizio Pollini gave his enthusiastic audience what it had come for: the high-powered, stunningly polished Apollonian readings that have long been his artistic signature, tempered by the earthy, almost theatrical emotionalism that has become part of his sound in recent seasons. His program, split evenly between Schumann and Chopin, supported that amalgam.</p>
        <p>Recent moves to show these composers, particularly Chopin, as extensions of Classicism rather than full-blooded Romantics clearly don't faze Mr. Pollini. He sent the music thundering into the hall, and availed himself fully of all the weapons Romanticism affords its interpreters. Not the least of these is a completely fluid rubato. In the Schumann Phantasie in C (Op. 17), Mr. Pollini used this flexibility of tempo to heighten the work's sense of impetuousness and characterize its torrent of anxieties. In the Chopin Sonata in B minor (Op. 35), he used it to lend a sense of ferocity at the end of the first movement, and to end the rushing figuration of the closing Presto with a surprisingly regal tone.</p>

        <p>At his recital at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening, the pianist Maurizio Pollini gave his enthusiastic audience what it had come for: the high-powered, stunningly polished Apollonian readings that have long been his artistic signature, tempered by the earthy, almost theatrical emotionalism that has become part of his sound in recent seasons. His program, split evenly between Schumann and Chopin, supported that amalgam.</p>
        <p>Recent moves to show these composers, particularly Chopin, as extensions of Classicism rather than full-blooded Romantics clearly don't faze Mr. Pollini. He sent the music thundering into the hall, and availed himself fully of all the weapons Romanticism affords its interpreters. Not the least of these is a completely fluid rubato. In the Schumann Phantasie in C (Op. 17), Mr. Pollini used this flexibility of tempo to heighten the work's sense of impetuousness and characterize its torrent of anxieties. In the Chopin Sonata in B minor (Op. 35), he used it to lend a sense of ferocity at the end of the first movement, and to end the rushing figuration of the closing Presto with a surprisingly regal tone.</p>
        <p>Also central to Mr. Pollini's performance was a broad palette of colors and dynamics, and the flexibility to move easily among the gradations. The coloristic extremes ran from the steely brightness that is typical of the Hamburg Steinway piano that he used, to a lush, rounded and uncommonly warm tone that, interpretive matters aside, shows how the instrument can sound in the right hands. For beauty of tone, Mr. Pollini's gentle, poetic readings of two Chopin Nocturnes (Op. 27, Nos. 1 and 2) were matchless.</p>
        <p>More tellingly, Mr. Pollini used clarity of line as an interpretive tool rather than a purely technical one: in Schumann's Allegro in B minor (Op. 8), which opened the program, the way Mr. Pollini carried Schumann's melody line through an increasingly dense texture made this orphaned movement from an unfinished sonata seem a grand statement in its own right. And in the Funeral March movement of Chopin's B minor Sonata, the alternation of haziness and complete transparency created a persuasive, otherworldly effect.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pollini also set one thinking about the delicate balance between the objective and the subjective in the way we hear music. There was ample beauty, power and thought in these performances, and that Mr. Pollini's gifts go well beyond the mechanics of piano technique. There was also the kind of electricity in the hall that one feels when a great interpretive presence is on the stage.</p>
        <p>Yet there was a deficit on the subjective side, a distance between Mr. Pollini and the listener that the facts of the performance were not enough to bridge. The most satisfying musical experiences are those in which the listener is a participant in an emotional transaction. Here, one had the sense of being a dispassionate observer of an apparently passionate act.</p>
