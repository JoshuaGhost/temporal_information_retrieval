        <p>Nonreactive Pots  Q. I've never been sure what a 'nonreactive'' pan is, and so many recipes call for them. Could you explain?  A. As the name implies, a nonreactive pan is one that will not interact with any of the substances it holds. Technically, it means anything that is not made of metal, since all metals react to some degree with heated liquids. But some metals are much more reactive than others, and when a recipe calls for a nonreactive pan or bowl, it basically means to avoid one made from unlined aluminum, copper or cast iron.</p>

        <p>Nonreactive Pots  Q. I've never been sure what a 'nonreactive'' pan is, and so many recipes call for them. Could you explain?  A. As the name implies, a nonreactive pan is one that will not interact with any of the substances it holds. Technically, it means anything that is not made of metal, since all metals react to some degree with heated liquids. But some metals are much more reactive than others, and when a recipe calls for a nonreactive pan or bowl, it basically means to avoid one made from unlined aluminum, copper or cast iron.</p>
        <p>This is because these three metals react quickly and noticeably with foods, especially those high in acid. In the case of aluminum and cast iron, light-colored ingredients can turn dingy and gray; in the case of copper, they can turn green. In fact,  Harold McGee, in his book ''The Curious Cook'' (North Point Press, 1990), says that at one time cooks were advised to boil vegetables in copper pots for the lovely green color it imparted.</p>
        <p>In the past there had been some concern about possible health risks associated with copper and aluminum pots and pans. But current research seems to show that while ingesting huge amounts of copper and aluminum can cause illness, cooking in unlined reactive pots does not appear to be a problem.</p>
        <p>In any case, nowadays most pots and pans are manufactured to be nonreactive. Copper and aluminum pans are routinely lined with stainless steel, which is virtually inert, and stainless steel can be used all by itself (although it doesn't conduct heat as well as when combined with copper or aluminum). Anodized aluminum (a hardened aluminum alloy), heat-resistant glass, and enameled stainless steel are some other nonreactive options.</p>
        <p>All this said, there is one thing to keep in mind: occasionally, a reaction is desirable. Such is the case with cast iron, since the iron leached into the food cooked in the pan is a beneficial dietary supplement.</p>
        <p>It is also the case with beating egg whites in a copper bowl, as pastry chefs discovered hundreds of years ago. This makes them much more stable, lessening the chance that they will break down. This is because the proteins in the egg whites bond with some of the acids in the copper and create a stronger, more flexible egg-white foam.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a copper bowl, you can achieve a similar effect by beating an acid into the whites: a pinch of cream of tartar or a drop of vinegar or citrus juice will do nicely.</p>
        <p>Confectioners' Sugar  Q. I know that confectioners' sugar normally contains a small amount of cornstarch -- 2 to 3 percent. I have used confectioners' sugar in several situations when I thought the cornstarch added an undesirable taste or texture. Is it possible to buy (or make) powdered sugar without the cornstarch?  A. Unfortunately, it isn't. The cornstarch is added to confectioners' sugar to keep it from caking; without it, the fine sugar crystals would meld into a solid block, making the sugar nearly impossible to use.</p>
        <p>While there is some pure powdered sugar made for pharmaceutical use, it is never sold for cooking since it requires special equipment to uncake it.</p>
        <p>Nor is it possible to make confectioners' sugar at home. While you can whirl granulated sugar in a blender until it's powdery, it will never have that melting, floury texture of true confectioners' sugar, and it will not thoroughly dissolve in butter creams and glazes. (It can, however, be used as a garnish in a pinch if no confectioners' sugar is at hand.)</p>
        <p>One thing to keep in mind about the cornstarch in confectioners' sugar is that it sometimes helps the recipe: it can make some types of cookies (shortbread, for example) and meringues crisper and some butter cakes melt-in-the-mouth tender.</p>
        <p>Large and Extra-Large Eggs  Q. I have been told that extra-large eggs are what you should use in recipes because today's large eggs are smaller than they used to be. Is this true?  A. According to the American Egg Board, it's not. Egg sizes have been standardized since the 1940's, and eggs are measured according to their average weight per dozen.</p>
        <p>People who have been around long enough might have noticed that eggs  look smaller in the skillet than they did before the widespread use of refrigerated trucks and before eggs were commonly refrigerated in supermarkets and kitchens. Because eggs stay fresher longer than they did a generation ago, the whites are firmer and more coagulated. Thus, when a fresh egg is broken into a frying pan, its white spreads less than whites used to, and therefore the egg looks smaller.</p>
        <p>So when a recipe calls for using large eggs, which most of them do, that's what you should use. But if you already have extra-large eggs on hand, you can use five of them for every six large eggs called for in the recipe.</p>
        <p>Clumpy, Heavy Risotto  Q. Why does my risotto always seem denser and clumpier than it does in restaurants, where every grain of rice seems distinct? I use arborio rice and stock, and follow directions, but I always have this problem.  A. Making a perfect creamy risotto -- in which individual grains of rice are soft enough and the consistency is somewhere between oatmeal and a cloud -- definitely takes practice. There are several things that can go wrong along the way, producing the results you describe: a heavy, sticky dish.</p>
        <p>The heaviness that plagues you probably comes from adding either too much liquid overall or from adding the right amount of liquid but adding it all at once. In either case, the rice will absorb the liquid too quickly and become dense and weighty. Better to add the liquid gradually, about a half a cup at a time.</p>
        <p>Add only enough to cook the rice through: to test if it's done, bite into a grain; it should be firm yet tender, and not at all chalky.</p>
        <p>The sticky clumps come from not stirring enough. Stirring the risotto helps break down the rice, releasing its starch. The starch binds the sauce, making it creamy and smooth. Traditionalists have a point: they contend that risotto must be  stirred constantly for its entire cooking time, which can run to 35 minutes.</p>
        <p>Some other hints for making a successful risotto: Don't rinse the rice (you want to preserve as much of the starch as possible). Sauteeing it first in butter or oil until it is translucent is an important step -- don't try to bypass it. Another vital point is to add only simmering liquid to the rice: keep your liquid at the ready on another burner. Once your risotto is done, serve it immediately. Sitting makes it heavier.</p>
