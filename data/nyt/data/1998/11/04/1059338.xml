        <p>ON a darkened stage, Marco Greco breathed slowly, rolled his shoulders and prepared to transport himself back to 1975 and Arthur Avenue. A spotlight vanquished the void, rendering his face into a chiaroscuro mask of a wide-eyed child. ''Pop,'' he said in a pleading little boy voice, ''I don't like to make the mozzarella. I just like to eat it.''</p>
        <p>He turned slightly to the side and assumed the cocky, tilted-head stance of an older man. ''Hey, no complain!'' boomed the heavily accented voice. ''Act like a man. Always treat the mozzarella like a bella femina. In life, baby, you be good to the mozzarella and the mozzarella be good to you.''</p>

        <p>ON a darkened stage, Marco Greco breathed slowly, rolled his shoulders and prepared to transport himself back to 1975 and Arthur Avenue. A spotlight vanquished the void, rendering his face into a chiaroscuro mask of a wide-eyed child. ''Pop,'' he said in a pleading little boy voice, ''I don't like to make the mozzarella. I just like to eat it.''</p>
        <p>He turned slightly to the side and assumed the cocky, tilted-head stance of an older man. ''Hey, no complain!'' boomed the heavily accented voice. ''Act like a man. Always treat the mozzarella like a bella femina. In life, baby, you be good to the mozzarella and the mozzarella be good to you.''</p>
        <p>This is the stuff of Mr. Greco's life, in which he mastered the art of making cheese at Mike's Deli, the Bronx landmark his father has run for decades at the Arthur Avenue Market. Now he has turned it into art yet again in ''Behind the Counter with Mussolini,'' a one-man play about fathers and sons, dictators and dreams. At the heart of the piece, which opens next week at the Theater at St. Peter's Church on East 54th Street, is the struggle between an immigrant father who works like a horse to live like a man, and his son, who is drawn to another world beyond the deli counter.</p>
        <p>It is not one of those I-Hate-My-Parents psychodramas. The play, like Mr. Greco's life, is a loving realization of the strength he drew from the frenzied marketplace where shoppers shouted and haggled with countermen for the best deals on ''pro-SHOOT'' and ''mooz-a-REL.'' His father's friends, food salesmen with giveaway nicknames like Joe Bananas and Nicky Fish,  are there. So, too, is the more complicated figure of Il Duce.</p>
        <p>''When we were growing up my father had a picture of Mussolini behind the counter,'' Marco said. ''It's still hanging. We always thought it was Uncle Fred, who was a sergeant in the U.S. Army. For me, it became a way to use Mussolini as a metaphor. Who, at some time in life, has not had the feeling their parents are dictators?''</p>
        <p>The assumption growing up under his stern father was that he would go into the family business. In the play, his character, Armando, became the mozzarella king who resists any idea of leaving the neighborhood. He spends time with his friends, who talk and act as if they were copping lines from the ''How to Be a Guido Handbook,'' replete with shorthand references to ''The Godfather,'' parts one and two. Life was ver-ry, ver-ry nice.</p>
        <p>But Marco, like Armando, began to change when he went to college.</p>
        <p>''I met the first girl who wasn't planning her wedding or worrying about hair gel,'' Marco said. ''And I had an anthropology teacher who was something else to look at.''</p>
        <p>What she taught him to look at was his culture. Suddenly, the customers at the deli became real to him in a way he had never noticed before. He learned their stories. He also began to consider leaving the deli.</p>
        <p>THE character in the play goes through Guid-tox and starts wearing corduroy pants with cuffs,'' he said. ''When your universe gets bigger, all of a sudden you can look at life very critically. But when you spend all this time watching your father work, doing it for you, it's not that easy to walk away.''</p>
        <p>Until somebody swiped a salami. Marco ran after the thief, his father also in pursuit. They caught him on Crescent Avenue, where father and son began to yell at each other.</p>
        <p>''In the process of arguing with my father, I grabbed the salami and whacked the guy twice in the head,'' Marco said. ''There is no pride in beating a guy with a salami. I couldn't believe I had come to this over a $20 piece of meat. We were no longer the immigrants off the boat desperate for two cents. What we did was vent the frustration between father and son.''</p>
        <p>Marco went to study drama, and later he started a theater troupe in the Bronx. He also traveled to the New World called Hollywood. He had some roles, but they were the tired bits that the masters of pop culture reserve for young Italians. Instead, he returned home and started writing his play. In doing so, he applied one of is father's lessons: work is good.</p>
        <p>''I'm scared,'' he said during a break in rehearsal. ''If this pleases the critics, my life can change drastically.''</p>
        <p>One critic has already approved. His father.</p>
        <p>''By himself, he discovered I gave him something good,'' Michael Greco said. ''The play, it's 100 percent true. That's why he makes me a proud father. He finally found out who is Michael Greco.''</p>
        <p>No complaints, baby.</p>
