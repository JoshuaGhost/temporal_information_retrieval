        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''You're Asked to Cheat. What to Do?'' (Oct. 11) noted how a recent survey found that slightly more men than women had ever been asked to be unethical in the workplace.</p>
        <p>I find this hard to believe, given that the most common unethical command probably comes from (mostly male) supervisors to the (mostly female) administrative assistants who answer their phones. ''Tell them I'm not here,'' is the usual order. While this may qualify as a little white lie, it is nevertheless unethical, and many secretaries are discomfited by having to lie for their bosses. And this is just one of many such infractions that administrative assistants are asked to commit daily.</p>
