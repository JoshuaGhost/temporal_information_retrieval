        <p>International Business Machines rejects proposal, backed by conservationists, to pay workers to use public transportation or join car pools at its facilities in Somers, NY (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The arguments of conservationists notwithstanding, International Business Machines has rejected a proposal -- sometimes referred to as a cash-out plan -- to pay workers to use public transportation or join car pools. At least at its Somers offices, where workers travel from different suburban spots, driving one's own car to work seems to be the most efficient mode of transportation, Jim Ruderman, an I.B.M. spokesman, said last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruderman said that I.B.M.'s office building in Somers, which will be adding up to 300 workers from other locations in the next several months, had asked local zoning board officials to approve a proposal to enlarge the company's parking lot.</p>

        <p>The spokesman said that I.B.M. workers would be relocated to Somers from Fairfield County, New Jersey and elsewhere in New York State. Under cash-out plans, workers are eligible for rebates if they do not drive their own cars but use alternative transportation to reduce highway traffic and air pollution.</p>
        <p>An independent consultant, however, said such plans are not always workable in rural areas like Somers where there is inadequate public transportation.</p>
