        <p>Katherine Ashenburg article on Iberian landmarks and Portuguese flavor still to be found in Macao, although it has long since assimilated into China and will soon revert to Chinese rule (special section, The Sophisticated Traveler) (part 2 of 2-part section) (M)</p>

        <p>For a peninsula measuring only nine square miles, little Macao has had multiple personalities. This ''city of indulgence,'' as W. H. Auden called it, has been, variously, the Western gateway to China, the busy nexus of international trade in the 17th century, the center of education for the Jesuits' Far Eastern missions, a sleepy summer retreat for 19th-century Hong Kong tycoons and, lately, a rather louche spot best known for triad wars and gambling.</p>

        <p>For a peninsula measuring only nine square miles, little Macao has had multiple personalities. This ''city of indulgence,'' as W. H. Auden called it, has been, variously, the Western gateway to China, the busy nexus of international trade in the 17th century, the center of education for the Jesuits' Far Eastern missions, a sleepy summer retreat for 19th-century Hong Kong tycoons and, lately, a rather louche spot best known for triad wars and gambling.</p>
        <p>The personality I had come to see was the Portuguese colonial city. And none too soon, because what was the first European settlement in Asia is now the last, and it is about to revert to China. Portugal's crucial Asian niche since 1557, the city and two islands that make up the province of Macao will cease to be Portuguese at midnight on Dec. 20, 1999.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Iberian landmarks will remain -- the Baroque churches washed in tropical-fruit colors, the 19th-century theater named for a Portuguese king, the neoclassical legislative building proudly called Leal Senado (Loyal Senate) to mark Macao's fealty to the Portuguese crown. And, no doubt, the sidewalk cafes will still serve Portuguese-inspired dishes with genuine vinho verde, along with a southern European air of languor and live-and-let-live. Because there's already a fair amount of interchange between China and Macao, the handover is expected to be peaceful (although China's recent announcement that it plans to deploy troops in Macao after it takes control came as an unpleasant surprise to the Portuguese).</p>
        <p>But some things will change, such as, for example, the signs in Portuguese and Chinese. Since only about 3 percent of Macanese speak Portuguese, the Chinese Government may well decide on unilingual signs. Yet it was the constant pairing of Chinese characters with a Romance language that gave me a historical frisson every time I saw them, a running reminder of four-and-a-half centuries of European occupation in Asia.</p>
        <p>A very large reminder, and the obvious place to start a tour of Macao, is the Largo do Senado, or Senate Square, in the south-central part of town. Here European buildings dedicated to church, state, commerce and charity -- colored cantaloupe, ocher, pistachio, strawberry -- line a square patterned in mosaic waves. Its namesake, the Leal Senado, is a lovingly restored 19th-century reconstruction of a grave 18th-century building damaged by a typhoon. Senators appointed for life to govern the little colony met in a grand but rather domestic chamber, furnished with red brocade, lashings of gilt and very dark carved chairs and table. With an adjoining chapel, a walled garden and a staircase lined with blue-and-white Portuguese azulejos (tiles), the Senado feels like the quarters of a close but dignified family.</p>
        <p>At the summit of the Senado's stone staircase is one of the most endearing public libraries anywhere. Inspired by a convent library in Coimbra, Portugal, the two old rooms (behind the first, modern room) are splendid in themselves, with gleaming, near-black teak shelves, carved galleries topped with urns and cartouches, grand Louis XIV chairs and tables under a white-and-gold ceiling.</p>
        <p>As with the Senado, the scale is domestic, like a Portuguese aristocrat's library, and the collection, some 40,000 volumes, includes one of the largest English-language caches of books on China in the world, as well as many on Portugal and its colonies.</p>
        <p>On your right as you leave the Senado is a bright white 18th-century building, its pediment filled in with a folkloric design of what looks like runner beans. It's a good emblem for the Santa Casa da Misericordia (Holy House of Mercy), a charity that has been the support of orphans, the aged, the sick and the indigent since about 1568. Misericordias, as they were called, were closely connected with Portuguese royalty and with the country's colonies; there were more than a dozen in Portuguese Asia, and Macao's was the most important, as well as a key element in Macanese society.</p>
        <p>The curious can slip up the Travessa da Misericordia (a small street to the left facing the Casa) and visit a main reception room and balcony hung with pictures of dour Portuguese donors and decorated with the skull and rosary of the founder, Bishop Belchior Carneiro.</p>
        <p>Just beyond the Largo do Senado stands Sao Domingos (St. Dominic), perhaps Macao's prettiest church. Built in the early 17th century, of cream-of-banana plaster with white stucco moldings, it has a Baroque gable set off by twin frosted urns at each side. The church has been recently refurbished so that every delicate white garland and rosette on its facade is in perfect repair. The inside is cool, triple-aisled and equally decorative. Apron balconies at the rear and sides undulate around the rectangular space, pleasantly complicating its simple shape, and to the right of the main altar, there's a jolly statue of St. Dominic wearing his gold halo at a rakish angle.</p>
        <p>Sao Domingos's three-story bell tower houses a museum of religious sculpture, a kind of glorified church attic where all kinds of ecclesiastical flotsam and jetsam are displayed with English labels (rare in Macao). Many of the wonderfully individuated saints are carved in madeira mahogany from Macao and Goa, Portugal's former Indian colony, but it's the fragments that are the most evocative -- crowns and halos to suit every taste, rosaries and vestments. Some of the displays are deliberately, comically surreal. There is a chest full of saints' parts -- heads, hands, a lower leg with a shoe, a lower leg without a shoe. Similarly, the disembodied feet and hands from a 19th- or 20th-century Macanese statue of Jesus are upended in a case, with results that Salvador Dali might have envied.</p>
        <p>On the January morning I was there, I was the only visitor. The top floor, in particular, with its Macanese bells, cast in 1825, and a beautiful hipped log ceiling, was impressively peaceful. Also impressively European, as I realized when I descended to the square and found ''Barberia Shanghai'' to the left and to the right a ''Farmacia Chinese'' full of roots, twigs and herbs.</p>
        <p>I decided to have lunch at Alfonso III, a Macanese restaurant on the Rua Central, to the left of the Leal Senado as you face it. Small and dusky, decorated mostly with racks and racks of wine bottles, Alfonso III could lull you into thinking you were in Portugal: the wine is ruby-colored and accommodating; the caldo verde is a poetic meeting of spinach and rich buttery broth; the pork chops come in a garlicky, deliciously acidic jus. But there are other, more Macanese, grace notes: the bread mousse with coriander that blends Orient and Occident, the customers and waiters moving easily back and forth between Chinese and Portuguese.</p>
        <p>Later, as I was making my way to another Portuguese square, through the haze of well-being that attends an excellent lunch, I pondered Macao's not entirely savory modern reputation. Chinese schoolgirls in navy tunics were giggling their way back to class along the Rua Central, and Macao seemed much better than benign. But it was Wednesday, and there's no denying that the gambling that has fueled Macao's economy since the 1840's makes it undesirable on weekends. That's when Hong Kongers crowd the casinos, massage parlors, hotels and restaurants, and prices rise accordingly.</p>
        <p>The triad wars, which are connected to the gambling, are also a fact of Macanese life. When I told my daughter, Sybil, who lives in Hong Kong, that I was planning to visit Macao, she noted, with the insouciance of youth, that hotel prices had really come down since the last triad killings. Not words to gladden the heart of the cautious traveler but, in fact, you eat, drink, window-shop for Chinese antiquities and learn a lot about Portuguese Baroque in Macao with very little worry.</p>
        <p>Up the Rua Central from Alphonso III is a particularly intense little Portuguese quarter. The first sign of Largo de Santo Agostinho is a looming neoclassical theater, the color of creme de menthe, that is said to be the oldest European theater in Asia. Built in 1858 and named Dom Pedro V for Portugal's ruling monarch, it acquired its stately triple-arched and columned facade in 1873. Over the years it played host to opera companies, amateur theatrical troupes, World War II refugees (as a dormitory) and a long-running strip show; newly restored, it is now the venue for touring music and drama as well as a local revue performed in the Macanese patois. You don't need to understand Macanese to enjoy the lobby, where the faded formality of Portuguese and Chinese furniture conjures up an enigmatic, pleasure-loving society.</p>
        <p>To the side of the theater is the square's namesake, the church of Santo Agostinho (St. Augustine). Chunky and rather bold on the outside, where Sao Domingos is elegant and fastidious, it was built in 1814, with a classical facade. Inside, a sign by the Gothic Revival confessional announces that you can tell Father Ruiz your sins in Cantonese, Mandarin, English, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and French.</p>
        <p>Santo Agostinho's main attraction, on the high altar, is a statue of Christ bearing the cross that is said to have floated ashore in the 16th century. The authorities kept moving it to Macao's cathedral, but the statue, according to legend, obstinately returned each time to the original church of Santo Agostinho. This is commemorated every Ash Wednesday, when the statue is paraded in great state from the cathedral to Santo Agostinho, past stations of the cross arranged across town. Even the Passos, as the procession is called, has a miracle attached. In 1712, when the Augustinian fathers were briefly deported and the Passos discontinued, there was a serious shortage of food. The Macanese put one and one together and insisted that ''the man with the cross on his shoulders'' resume his walk through town. The bishop agreed and the shortage ended.</p>
        <p>Also on the square (which is more like a closely packed street) is the Seminario de Sao Jose, in the same shade of green as Dom Pedro V, and Casa Ricci, a Jesuit house and charity. Behind a shady courtyard planted with laurels, camellias and ferns stands the yellow colonial mansion of the Hong Kong businessman Sir Robert Ho Tung, now a cultural center and library of Chinese books.</p>
        <p>Rua Central turns into Rua de Sao Lourenco (St. Lawrence), named for Macao's chicest church. (If you're in town on Sunday morning, Sao Laurenco's palmy garden before and after Mass is recommended for people watching.)</p>
        <p>Sheltered by an elaborate fence, the church has two square towers, one with a clock, the other a bell. In a typical Macanese progression, it was built of wood in the 1560's; reconstructed in taipa, a mixture of straw, earth and lime, around 1618; and finally, built in stone in the early 19th century.</p>
        <p>Around the back of Sao Lourenco is the Rua de Inacio Baptista, where George Chinnery, an English artist who painted scenes of the China coast, lived from 1827 until his death in 1852. By the 1800's, Macao's golden age had been over for almost two centuries, and Chinnery's paintings depict a drowsy Eurasian backwater that is recognizable to visitors today; in addition, he produced oil portraits of everyone from rich Chinese merchants to Robert Morrison, who translated the Bible into Chinese.</p>
        <p>Chinnery also drew Macao's proudest and most poignant image, the great church of Sao Paolo, before and after its destruction by fire in 1835. (Sao Paolo is north of Sao Domingos, at the end of Rua de Palha.) Opened by the Jesuits in 1603, it was the ambitious church for their equally ambitious missionary college, which had a library of 4,200 books, a printing press and alumni like the legendary missionary Matteo Ricci, who learned Chinese there. The outline of the church has been redrawn in a scholarly, open-air reconstitution that dates from 1996. Sao Paolo's glorious facade, which is all that remains today, was completed in the 1630's. A four-story, sculptured granite sampler of Jesuit saints, Old and New Testament figures and symbols, Japanese chrysanthemums and Chinese peonies, it was built by Chinese artisans and Japanese Christians in the Iberian version of Baroque -- a fitting symbol for Macao.</p>
        <p>Sometimes when I discover an intriguing place, I imagine an ideal life for myself there. In Macao, I'd spend my mornings strolling through the Camoes Gardens, north of Sao Paolo, named for the 16th-century Portuguese poet Luiz de Camoes whose epic, ''Os Lusiadas,'' is believed to have been composed in Macao. And I would walk next door to the English Cemetery where George Chinnery is buried, then on to pick up a bit of expertise in Chinese antiques in the shops on the Rua Sao Paolo. Lunch at Alfonso III would include a glass of Portuguese red wine and African chicken -- chicken with Goan and African spices -- a Macanese specialty.</p>
        <p>The center of my day would be determined by the Leal Senado library's hours. Seated at one of those Louis XIV chairs under the glass chandeliers, overlooking the pastel buildings on the Largo do Senado, I'd immerse myself in the beautifully bound collection, doing research, perhaps, for a novel based on Chinnery's slightly seedy but productive life in Macao. And every once in a while, when the reading made me sleepy, I'd meander across the square into the museum in Sao Domingos, just to admire those halos and saints' parts all over again.</p>
        <p>A Voyage to Macao</p>
        <p>Macao can be reached from Hong Kong by ferry, jetfoil, turbocats or helicopter.</p>
        <p>Hotel prices in Macao tend to be significantly cheaper on weekdays than on weekends, when the town is crowded with gamblers from Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Bela Vista, 8-10 Rua do Comendador Ko Ho Neng (telephone: 853-965-333; fax: 853-965-588), is a colonial mansion perched by the sea in southeastern Macao. There is a restaurant, a bar and eight luxurious rooms; prices for doubles, with bath, start at about $390 for Saturday night stays, about $265 for weeknights. Newly restored, the hotel is scheduled to become the Portuguese consulate in 2000. It will close as a hotel at the end of March 1999.</p>
        <p>Pousada de Sao Tiago, Avenida da Republica (853-378-111; fax: 853-552-170), is set within the foundations of a 17th-century fortress at the southern tip of the peninsula. There are 24 period-style rooms, many with sea views; prices for double rooms, with bath, start at about $175 for weekend stays, with up to a 20 percent discount for Monday to Wednesday night visits. The hotel has a swimming pool, a coffee shop, a bar and several restaurants.</p>
        <p>East Asia, 1-A Rue de Madeira (853-922-433; fax: 853-922-430), in the heart of the city, is considered one of Macao's better inexpensive hotels. There are 98 rooms in a colonial building, and prices for a double, with bath, start at about $50 on weekends, $35 during the week.</p>
        <p>Alfonso III, 11 Rua Central (853-586-272), is lined with wine bottles. The chef (Alfonso) does fine things with old Portuguese recipes and local ingredients. Dinner for two, with a glass of wine, is about $40.</p>
        <p>Comida a Portuguesa Carlos, 28 Rua Bispo Medeiros (853-522-027), is popular for Portuguese dishes and friendly service. Specialties include bacalhau abraz, a cod dish, and ferradura, a custardlike dessert. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $25.</p>
        <p>Pizzeria Toscana, in the Grand Prix building, Avenida da Amizade (853-726-637), across from the jetfoil terminal, can be spotted by its leaning tower of pizza sign. In addition to pizza, pasta and salads are served. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $20.</p>
