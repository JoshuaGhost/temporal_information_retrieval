        <p>James de la Vega  Caribbean Cultural Center  408 West 58th Street, Clinton  Through Dec. 24</p>
        <p>The work of the painter James de la Vega, 26, is everywhere in the neighborhood around Lexington Avenue north of 100th Street. His mural paintings of local residents, madonnas, Puerto Rican cultural heroes and a fantastic Big Apple version of Picasso's ''Guernica'' cover the walls of buildings. His ''tape drawings,'' in which figures are outlined with strips of masking tape, then spray painted, are underfoot on sidewalks and streets.</p>

        <p>James de la Vega  Caribbean Cultural Center  408 West 58th Street, Clinton  Through Dec. 24</p>
        <p>The work of the painter James de la Vega, 26, is everywhere in the neighborhood around Lexington Avenue north of 100th Street. His mural paintings of local residents, madonnas, Puerto Rican cultural heroes and a fantastic Big Apple version of Picasso's ''Guernica'' cover the walls of buildings. His ''tape drawings,'' in which figures are outlined with strips of masking tape, then spray painted, are underfoot on sidewalks and streets.</p>
        <p>Tape drawings fill the small gallery of the Caribbean Cultural Center for the artist's first New York solo show. A huge scarlet figure of the Afro-Christian saint Lazarus leaps in fury from one wall; a life-size Last Supper of chattering skeletons fills another, labeled with tape-written words: spiritual slogans, a tribute to people who died from AIDS, a dedication to the artist's infant daughter.</p>
        <p>The show -- graphically bold, funny, passionate -- brings a public art form indoors with striking success. A group of photographs by Christine Camilo give a vivid sense of what Mr. de la Vega's outdoor work looks like in situ. But why not go straight to the source? A short trip on the No. 6 train to 103d Street will land you in a vibrant neighborhood where art meets life at every turn. Like Mr. de la Vega himself, it's a New York treasure.</p>
