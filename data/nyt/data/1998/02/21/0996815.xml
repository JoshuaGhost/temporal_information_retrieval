        <p>Walter Goodman, in Critic's Notebook column, comments on recent barrage of television coverage of Pres Clinton's travails regarding Monica Lewinsky, and Saddam Hussein's confrontation with US over chemical weapons; lauds what he sees as 'thoughtful ambivalance' of 'much-manipulated' viewing public on issues (M)</p>

        <p>The dire moment came early during Wednesday's so-called town meeting at Ohio State University, devised by the Administration to whip up enthusiasm for the bombing of Iraq, when Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen displayed for the CNN camera a picture of an Iraqi mother and child who he said had been killed by nerve gas. He titled it, ''Madonna and Child, Saddam Hussein Style.''</p>
        <p>With that exhibit, Mr. Cohen exposed the White House's conception of the meeting. It was to be an appeal to the afternoon television audience, an easy target for sentiment. But the audience turned out to be a tough one. The questions were demanding, and Mr. Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, were left looking stiff and stranded on their talking points.</p>

        <p>The dire moment came early during Wednesday's so-called town meeting at Ohio State University, devised by the Administration to whip up enthusiasm for the bombing of Iraq, when Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen displayed for the CNN camera a picture of an Iraqi mother and child who he said had been killed by nerve gas. He titled it, ''Madonna and Child, Saddam Hussein Style.''</p>
        <p>With that exhibit, Mr. Cohen exposed the White House's conception of the meeting. It was to be an appeal to the afternoon television audience, an easy target for sentiment. But the audience turned out to be a tough one. The questions were demanding, and Mr. Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, were left looking stiff and stranded on their talking points.</p>
        <p>For the persistent watcher, the two wars that have been raging on television for weeks -- one having to do with Bill Clinton in the White House, the other with Saddam Hussein in this or that palace -- have been both exasperating and heartening. Although the screen has been befogged by effusions of all sorts and from many sources, viewers have shown a stubborn resistance to being snowed. The masters of the tube have found themselves trying to catch up with their audience instead of leading it.</p>
        <p>Sure, it would be satisfying to drop bombs on Mr. Hussein, but viewers keep asking questions. Wouldn't that leave him, after our smart bombs have been dropped, still alive and in charge with his bacterial or chemical agents tucked away here and there?</p>
        <p>Nor has there been a coast-to-coast rush to judgment on the sex front. No, Mr. Clinton may not be an inveterate truth teller, but are Kenneth W. Starr's prosecutorial techniques and tendencies in the warmest American tradition?</p>
        <p>A good rule for television watchers is to mistrust anybody who presumes to speak for ''the American people,'' which practically everybody does, even the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister. But, to presume a little, the polls tell us that the nation is not getting fired up by patriotic appeals that worked in wars past or by the calls to battle of family-values crusaders.</p>
        <p>It cannot be altogether bad for the citizenry to try to think through matters as important as war and leadership, and in this job the better journalists have been treating audiences as allies instead of just customers. Spear carriers from the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon parade the channels with calls to attack Iraq, an easy sell as enemies go. But they keep being reminded of where the last American victory over the enduring Hussein left things. Yet can a threat involving such terrible weapons go unmet? Caught between an intolerable situation and an unpersuasive solution, much of the nation is irresolute.</p>
        <p>Back to domestic matters, the spoutings of both the Clinton-hating crusaders and the pro-Clinton vast-conspiracy loyalists are being shrugged away. Who can bear being instructed yet again on right and truth by James Carville or William J. Bennett? When not relishing the latest jokes, people actually seem to be pondering how much a President's sexual meanderings really matter to them or ought to matter to the nation.</p>
        <p>The questions linger, defying television conventions. Pop journalism often goes in more for scoring points  than for reflecting. The pace and spirit of the enterprise demand superficiality as know-it-all hosts conspire with loquacious guests in the show-business game: every subject comes with a guaranteed solution and the stars better have it at tongue's tip.</p>
        <p>This time around, however, the professionals have been nonplused; the animals are restless. Now the most interesting question facing the correspondents, commentators and experts is what to make of the contradictory feelings of a public that refuses to be a herd.</p>
        <p>Analysts are having trouble getting a fix on the millions out there who don't particularly trust their President but dislike his prosecutor and, barring some devastating revelation or economic downturn, can live reasonably comfortably with a sex scandal. Other millions may not mind socking it to Mr. Hussein and can be counted on to root for the  pilots whatever their assignment but are having trouble believing in the promise of a clean war that will do the job, and anyway who likes wars?</p>
        <p>Is the questioning on show at Ohio State University a symptom of shallow thinking or unwholesome skepticism or a failure of fortitude or a want of moral fiber? If so, television must bear some of the blame. But give it credit, too. Amid the gabble, necessary questions are being asked that are likely to reverberate after this scandal and this war or threat of war are played out.</p>
        <p>And whatever one's hopes for the fate of Bill Clinton or Saddam Hussein, how can one fail to welcome the thoughtful ambivalence of a much manipulated audience? There are cases where ambivalence is the better part of valor and of moral judgments. The professional force-feeders are being forced to attend to what their audiences are and should be concerned about. Pictures of a mother and child just won't do.</p>
