        <p>THE session was billed as an ''Asia crisis update.'' Nearly 600 people jammed into the auditorium on Friday, the opening day of the World Economic Forum here. For an hour, they listened to seven experts dissect the causes, the damage and the culprits of what more than one called the worst financial crisis since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>But only at the end, when questions were taken from the floor, did an issue on many people's minds finally bubble to the surface: What can be done to prevent another, similar crisis in the future?</p>
        <p>That is not an easy question for the hundreds of prominent government leaders, economists, corporate chief executives, bankers, financiers and entrepreneurs who gather at this mountain ski resort every January for almost a week of discussion and networking. This is a group that has prospered from the world order as it is, and they don't cheer proposals for radical change.</p>
        <p>''You probably can't develop a system for preventing another crisis,'' said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist for Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific group. ''Free markets don't behave in orderly, predictable ways.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Courtis and others here see it, the meltdown of four Asian economies -- like the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980's and the Mexican crisis in 1995 -- are inevitable, periodic upheavals. They can be contained to prevent a global depression, as the International Monetary Fund is trying to do in Asia, but they cannot be avoided. Some even view the Asian turmoil as healthy.</p>
        <p>''No one is going to control capital movements; that is like being against mother's milk,'' said Rudiger Dornbusch, an international economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''That has been capitalism's nature for 200 years. And in between crises, people prosper.''</p>
        <p>In speaking of ''capital movements,'' Professor Dornbusch referred to the flood of short-term foreign loans into South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia that borrowers in those countries could no longer repay late last year, particularly after their currencies plunged in value. From his perspective, the resulting bankruptcies in South Korea, for example, have closed down companies that were not economically viable anyway.</p>
        <p>''The Koreans are already saying,'' Professor Dornbusch noted, ''that the crisis has helped them to get rid of overcapacity in manufacturing.''</p>
        <p>The Asian crisis, however, is also generating proposals to change the global crisis-response system, and those ideas are popping up among the delegates here.</p>
        <p>In response to a question at the ''Asia crisis'' session, Young Soogil, president of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, called for a global system of coordinating national economic policies.</p>
        <p>''Europe does this, but Asia does not,'' he said. He also proposed a system of monitoring short-term loans made across borders.</p>
        <p>''The I.M.F. should monitor the flow of this short-term money,'' Mr. Young said -- and Mr. Courtis, whose own bank holds tens of millions in shaky, short-term Asian loans, agreed. The I.M.F., he said, should take on a task it does not now engage in -- detailed monitoring of the financial situation within each of its member countries.</p>
        <p>''You have to make this information publicly available well ahead of any potential crisis,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''The markets would then respond, demanding higher rates of interest in the questionable countries.''</p>
        <p>THAT is not enough for Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist at the World Bank and the former head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
        <p>''There will be periodic financial crises,'' he said. ''That view is correct. But the view that we can't do anything through government policies to decrease the frequency of these crises, or ameliorate their magnitude, is wrong.''</p>
        <p>Arguing that lenders -- in Asia's case, major banks in Japan, Europe and the United States -- are often as much a cause of a crisis as borrowers are, Mr. Stiglitz called for rules that would discourage short-term lending across borders. Chile adopted such controls after a severe debt crisis of its own in the 1980's. There, a borrower must deposit 30 percent of a loan in a noninterest-bearing account for a number of months -- a penalty if the loan is short term, but not much of one if the loan is for five years or more and helps finance a new factory or business.</p>
        <p>''You want to look for policies that discourage 'hot money' but facilitate the flow of long-term loans,'' Mr. Stiglitz said, ''and there is evidence now that the Chilean approach, or some version of it, does this.''</p>
