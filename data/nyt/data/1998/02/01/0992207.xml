        <p>Editorial on allegations concerning Pres Clinton and Monica Lewinsky; observes that, once again, Americans are being asked to suspend judgment about personality and character of a President in interests of stability and prosperity</p>

        <p>The United States has arrived at one of those peculiar moments when what is good for the immediate political interests of a sitting President is harmful to the political culture of the nation. We have seen the same split on a much more momentous level with Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War and a few years later with Richard Nixon and Watergate. The defining crisis of this President seems frail in comparison, because of its tawdriness.</p>
        <p>But on the level of political morality and public disenchantment and the President's presumed duty to embody the rule of law in a society founded on the sanctity of law, there are similarities. Once again, Americans are being invited to suspend judgment about the personality and character of a President in the interest of stability, prosperity and orderly succession. Based on the polls' latest snapshot of public opinion, a heavy majority of Americans have reached a provisional decision to muddle through with a leader they do not believe rather than go through the trauma of resignation or removal.</p>

        <p>The United States has arrived at one of those peculiar moments when what is good for the immediate political interests of a sitting President is harmful to the political culture of the nation. We have seen the same split on a much more momentous level with Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War and a few years later with Richard Nixon and Watergate. The defining crisis of this President seems frail in comparison, because of its tawdriness.</p>
        <p>But on the level of political morality and public disenchantment and the President's presumed duty to embody the rule of law in a society founded on the sanctity of law, there are similarities. Once again, Americans are being invited to suspend judgment about the personality and character of a President in the interest of stability, prosperity and orderly succession. Based on the polls' latest snapshot of public opinion, a heavy majority of Americans have reached a provisional decision to muddle through with a leader they do not believe rather than go through the trauma of resignation or removal.</p>
        <p>It may be a wise choice, but it is an ineffably saddening one. To face it afflicts the national psyche because Americans place such a high value on admiration of the President. Aside from people with White House ties, there are few public figures -- and few Democrats in Congress -- willing to argue spontaneously for President Clinton. The dilemma of the nation's feminist organizations reflects that of the electorate at large. Because Mr. Clinton is an effective advocate of their legislative needs, the women's groups are willing to put some of their other values into hibernation for a few years.</p>
        <p>This emerging consensus for an arranged, no-illusions stability based on the realpolitik pragmatism of consenting adults could be shattered by sexual revelations that repel Middle America or by definitive evidence that Mr. Clinton violated the law. But for the moment it is the foundation of Hillary Clinton's bluntly effective spin operation. Her lumping of all Presidential critics into a right-wing conspiracy is, of course, demagogic, even allowing for book-packagers and other unwholesome hangers-on around Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Paula Jones. The historic arc of this Presidency has been of people starting out as supporters on issues like health care and free trade and then gradually becoming disenchanted. It is not enlistment in a cabal that turns them but rather revulsion at one or another serial embarrassment having to do with fugitive contributors or the bartering of White House invitations or financial windfalls for disgraced courtiers or, in this case, allegations of mysteriously un-Presidential associations.</p>
        <p>Like Tom and Daisy Buchanan in ''The Great Gatsby,'' the Clintons sometimes operate with a ''vast carelessness'' that leaves wreckage behind. Since 1992, their political organization has had an announced policy of dismantling the reputation of any woman linked to the President. Most of these women, like Ms. Lewinsky, have vulnerabilities that make them fairly easy to undermine. That, in turn, sets up the next wave of defense, which is to no-comment even the most compromising disclosures and to defame any questioner as a tool of the fictional conspiracy.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, this approach created the odd spectacle of a President sending out the First Lady to announce those areas of his Oval Office stewardship about which he may be asked and those which are out of bounds. Mike McCurry conceded that ''ultimately people want to hear from the President on this,'' but Mr. Clinton's lawyers have buried the political advisers who wanted the President to talk.</p>
        <p>A muzzled President is an embarrassment for any White House, but Clinton advisers are betting that Kenneth Starr will fill the silence by blowing himself up. Because he does come with political baggage, Mr. Starr is at his testing time. He has moved slowly and expensively, but events could vindicate the earlier part of his inquiry. Where he has no latitude and little remaining time is on the question of whether he can build a valid case around Ms. Lewinsky. Just as the nation needs a President who can give fuller answers, it needs for Mr. Starr to decide the threshold questions about Ms. Lewinsky's credibility and immunity status and get to the next step in his case, if he has one.</p>
        <p>For the time being, there is no question about Mr. Starr's legal mandate. It was signed by Attorney General Janet Reno, whose credentials as the President's legal protector are beyond question. But this is a case where the public needs to see the legal process moving toward resolution. After all, in times devoid of heroes, the law is what this Republic is meant to cling to. It must move toward truths that seem unobtainable from other quarters.</p>
