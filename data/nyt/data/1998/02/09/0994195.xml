      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The resignation of Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, earlier this month was a disturbing development for peace and ethnic harmony in the Caucasus. Largely Christian Armenia is at war with its larger and richer Muslim neighbor, Azerbaijan, over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan populated by Armenians, who are seeking independence. In September, Mr. Ter-Petrossian, under pressure from the United States, France and Russia, announced his support for a peace plan that contained necessary compromises. The compromises enraged hard-liners in his Government and parliamentary coalition, who forced him to resign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ter-Petrossian was already unpopular, largely due to suspicions that he won the 1996 election through fraud. But his peace plan, seen by many Armenians as a sellout, is the only realistic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh war, which began in 1988 after the enclave demanded Armenian rule and has killed 25,000 people, mostly civilians. It has sabotaged Armenia's economy and threatens the stability of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea region. Mr. Ter-Petrossian's ouster increases chances that a cease-fire that has held since 1994 will be broken.</p>

        <p>The resignation of Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, earlier this month was a disturbing development for peace and ethnic harmony in the Caucasus. Largely Christian Armenia is at war with its larger and richer Muslim neighbor, Azerbaijan, over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan populated by Armenians, who are seeking independence. In September, Mr. Ter-Petrossian, under pressure from the United States, France and Russia, announced his support for a peace plan that contained necessary compromises. The compromises enraged hard-liners in his Government and parliamentary coalition, who forced him to resign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ter-Petrossian was already unpopular, largely due to suspicions that he won the 1996 election through fraud. But his peace plan, seen by many Armenians as a sellout, is the only realistic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh war, which began in 1988 after the enclave demanded Armenian rule and has killed 25,000 people, mostly civilians. It has sabotaged Armenia's economy and threatens the stability of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea region. Mr. Ter-Petrossian's ouster increases chances that a cease-fire that has held since 1994 will be broken.</p>
        <p>His resignation also formalizes the increasing grip on power of an unsavory band of military and security officials. Their troops beat demonstrators protesting election fraud, and some have ties to a group that has attacked religious minorities.</p>
        <p>The sponsors of the negotiations, most importantly Moscow, must scramble to keep the peace effort from collapse. They must persuade Armenia's new leaders that the agreement, which would result in some form of autonomy but not independence for Nagorno-Karabakh, is the only chance to achieve the stability and peace their country needs.</p>
        <p>International groups must mobilize now to supervise new elections scheduled for March 16, as another ballot clouded by fraud would harm Armenia's teetering democracy. But even a clean election is unlikely to choose a president willing to make the compromises necessary for peace.</p>
