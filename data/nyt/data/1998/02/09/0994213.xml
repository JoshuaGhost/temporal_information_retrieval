        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was pleased to see your Feb. 4 Arts pages tribute to Eleanor Gould Packard, the grammarian for The New Yorker. Paradoxically, the article was in the same issue as a  news item reporting that The New Yorker is now going to be folded into the rest of the Conde Nast conglomerate, losing whatever independence it had.</p>
        <p>My first encounter with Miss Gould occurred in the early 1960's when I wrote a dual profile of  the physicists T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang. It was the first technically complicated piece of scientific writing to appear in the magazine.  Mr. Lee and Mr. Yang had made monumental contributions to the theory of the so-called weak interactions.</p>
        <p>I wrote, ''The neutrino interacts only weakly.'' Miss Gould suggested changing ''weakly'' to ''weekly.'' When William Shawn, the editor of the magazine, showed me the change, I suggested ''every other weekly.'' Alas and of course, that did not get into the magazine. Nonetheless, Miss Gould saved me, and countless other writers, from all sorts of folly.</p>
