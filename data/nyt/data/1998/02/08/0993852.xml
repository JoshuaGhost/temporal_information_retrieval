        <p>IT was a summer evening almost four years ago, just after a spoken word night at Common Boundaries, an art gallery in Jersey City. The young crowd of about two dozen poets, artists and others was abuzz, partly from the poetry and partly from the wine. McLean Greaves, a freelance magazine writer who wears what he calls ''Henry Kissinger-style glasses,'' asked Tyrone Thomas, a programmer at A T &amp; T Bell Laboratories, ''Can you multiply two hexadecimal numbers?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas laughed, recognizing a kindred, if oddball, spirit. Hexadecimals, a number system in which the base is 16, are useful in computer programming.</p>
        <p>''It was like hanging out with lumberjacks,'' Mr. Thomas recalled. ''It was like, what kind of chain saw do you use?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greaves, who was once a new-media editor at Paper magazine, and Mr. Thomas became fast friends. Along with a fluid band of writers, musicians, graphic artists and computer programmers, they formed Virtual Melanin Inc., a Web site designer -- that is, a designer of the text, pictures and graphics of a Web site -- with a black and Hispanic focus. Its corporate symbol is the classic silhouette of Miles Davis blowing his trumpet, but with a television set for a head.</p>
        <p>It was, at the start, an exercise in working on a shoestring or, perhaps more appropriately, a computer cable. Like many new-media startups, it was driven almost entirely by the dreams and dedication of its founders. In a business where technology seemingly advances at the speed of light, Virtual Melanin operated on equipment that was almost from the Stone Age. It competes for clients in what is increasingly a cutthroat climate, an effort made more difficult by the company's location in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, miles geographically and psychologically from Silicon Alley, the Manhattan district of fashionable lofts and bustling medium-rise office buildings.</p>
        <p>There are more than 5,000 new-media companies in the New York area alone, according to the New York New Media Association, a trade group. It's essential to find a niche, as Girls on Film, a site about women reviewing movies, has done.</p>
        <p>For Virtual Melanin, it's primarily music, art and fashion from communities of color. As a demographic target, it's fresh territory: there are only a handful of similar companies in the New York area, including Platform (http://www.platform.net), a site out of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that focuses on hip-hop music, and the Black World Today (http://tbwt.com), a news and commentary service out of Teaneck, N.J.</p>
        <p>In terms of visibility, Virtual Melanin, after just two years in the business, is off to a good start. Its most visible Web site, Cafe Los Negroes, dubbed by Mr. Greaves ''New York's black and Latino virtual hangout,'' gets more than a million hits, or viewings, a month. The site has helped attract such high-profile clients as Terry Ellis of the singing group En Vogue; Bad Boy Entertainment, the urban music label founded by Sean (Puffy) Combs, and ''Cybersoul City,'' a program on Home Box Office.</p>
        <p>But while Cafe Los Negroes is a prime showcase for the company's talents, it is barely profitable. Virtual Melanin has yet to command contracts for much more than a few thousands dollars; its 1997 revenues are unlikely to exceed $150,000, and Mr. Greaves does not yet know if it made a profit last year. Times have been so tight that when a record company holds a promotion party, Virtual Melanin employees have been known to show up with backpacks and fill them with food. ''Everybody in Silicon Alley is starving,'' Mr. Greaves said, adjusting his signature black beret. ''We are just a bit more extreme.''</p>
        <p>The financial straits of Virtual Melanin, and many new-media companies like it, is no reflection on its skills; indeed, its clients and industry observers have been enthusiastic about the Web site.</p>
        <p>''McLean Greaves and the people at Virtual Melanin are extremely talented and innovative,'' said Jason McCabe Calacanis, editor and publisher of Silicon Alley Reporter, a monthly magazine that covers the New York City Internet industry. ''In terms of vision, they are way ahead of big corporations like Sony and Time Warner.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Calacanis added, ''In today's industry, talent isn't enough and they will need capital and strategic partners.''</p>
        <p>A visit to Virtual Melanin's offices attest to its lack of capital. It isn't even an office;  the venture is run mainly from Mr. Greaves's $475-a-month Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment. Dressed in sweatshirts and jeans and stepping carefully around a living room of computer cables and equipment, Mr. Greaves and his crew are as raucous and sloppy as their Cafe Los Negroes site is laid-back and hip.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Greaves, 31, and Mr. Thomas, the chief technology officer, 27, the core of the company is Henry Branker Jr., 27, who is the senior technician, and Arzie Hardin, 30, a former currency trader who is the  director of computer networks. There are about two dozen freelance writers and graphic designers who contribute by E-mail or conventional mail. The company has gotten by on secondhand and often rudimentary equipment. At one point last year, it had only a dilapidated personal computer, a slow laptop and a desktop dubbed a ''Tyrone,'' a computer of Mr. Thomas's making.</p>
        <p>There have been potholes along the way. Take the Terry Ellis project. After a recommendation from a friend, Sheila Eldridge, Ms. Ellis's publicity woman, hired Virtual Melanin to create a site to promote a new perfume, Southern Exposure, tied to Ms. Ellis's 1996 solo album, ''Southern Gal.''</p>
        <p>''I am African-American and I make it my business to do business with African-Americans,'' Ms. Eldridge said.</p>
        <p>At Ms. Eldridge's insistence, however, Virtual Melanin found a woman, a freelance graphic designer in California, who was simpatico with Ms. Ellis and Ms. Eldridge. But the designer continued with the Terry Ellis project even after getting a full-time job, which delayed her submissions to Virtual Melanin, which was hired to convert the designs for use on the Internet.</p>
        <p>So the Web site went on line 25 days after the contractually agreed date of Aug. 28, forcing a frenzy of around-the-clock work by Virtual Melanin's staff. While there were no penalties for the delay, and Virtual Melanin was paid all of its full $7,000 fee, the client was not pleased by the delay.</p>
        <p>''I penalized them in wrath, not in dollars,'' Ms. Eldridge said.</p>
        <p>It was, Mr. Greaves said, another example of the high-wire nature of the business. With a larger staff and a full-time graphics designer, he said, the Terry Ellis project would have moved along faster. But meager contracts for a few thousands of dollars each won't pay for more employees.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Eldridge and Ms. Ellis were pleased with the Web site, which helped to sell some 7,500 bottles of Southern Exposure, including nearly 1,000 sold directly via the Internet, a strong performance. Nordstrom, the big department store chain, noticed the site and now carries Southern Exposure in its stores.</p>
        <p>''I've talked to people I trust about computers, and they say for what I got $7,000 was a steal,'' Ms. Eldridge said.</p>
        <p>It is that kind of word-of-mouth comment that Mr. Greaves hopes will break Virtual Melanin from the pack of new-media firms.</p>
        <p>''We've got a long way to go, but we've gotten pretty far,'' he said. ''Someday receptionists will be able to do what we do, so we'll be knocking on doors, looking for the ideal angel.''</p>
