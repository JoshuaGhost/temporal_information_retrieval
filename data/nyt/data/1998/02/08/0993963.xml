        <p>Several hundred Palestinians marched in support of Iraq today, but without the popular support that accompanied the Persian Gulf war of 1991.</p>
        <p>Carrying Iraqi flags and chanting, ''With blood and soul we sacrifice for you, Iraq,'' the demonstrators marched the length of the main commercial road through Bethlehem. At one intersection, they paused to burn an American flag.</p>
        <p>When they reached the Israeli roadblock by Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish religious site that has become the scene of regular clashes, some Palestinian youths began throwing stones at the Israeli soldiers, who responded with rubber-coated bullets and tear gas.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian police quickly moved in to push the demonstrators back, and within an hour the demonstration ended.</p>
        <p>Three Palestinian policemen and three television crewmen were struck by the rubber-coated metal slugs, but no serious injuries were reported.</p>
        <p>The march demonstrated the mixed feelings with which Palestinians have met the latest American confrontation with Saddam Hussein. While in 1991, most Palestinians cheered Mr. Hussein as a champion of the Arab world and people danced on rooftops when Iraqi Scud missiles flew over, this time many seemed to see his defiance as detracting from their cause and doing little to help Arabs.</p>
        <p>Yasir Arafat's main Palestinian organization, Fatah, failed to support the march, and no senior leaders were present.</p>
        <p>Most demonstrators stressed that they were marching in solidarity with Iraqi people, not Mr. Hussein, though one group carried his portrait.</p>
        <p>Slogans shouted by the march leaders included: ''President Clinton the scandalous, striking Iraq is not allowed,'' and ''The smile of a child is stronger than an airplane carrier.''</p>
        <p>''This is a symbolic gesture,'' said Tayseer al-Saifi, a shopkeeper, as he watched the 300 or so marchers go by. ''Here we are under the stick ourselves, and we're trying to help our cousins. In the gulf war it was different, we were under occupation. Now we're committed to the peace process, but we have to express our sympathy for the Iraqis.''</p>
        <p>''I can say that the enthusiasm of the Palestinian people for Saddam Hussein is colder than in 1991,'' said another passer-by, who gave his name only as Mohammed. ''Saddam did not achieve anything for his own people or the Arab people,'' he continued. ''We're not interested in Saddam, but everyone is against striking Iraq. Many countries have done the same or worse.''  STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE TENSIONS</p>
