        <p>Many medical groups and women's advocates have for years been concerned about what they call a gender gap in health coverage: Although health plans generally cover prescription drugs, most exclude contraceptives, which results in more out-of-pocket expenses for women than for men.</p>
        <p>But a closely watched effort in California to change coverage plans  appears headed for defeat.</p>
        <p>Gov. Pete Wilson must decide by Wednesday whether to sign legislation requiring health plans that cover prescription drugs to cover many contraceptives as well.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Wilson said on Friday that the Governor was leaning strongly toward a veto.</p>
        <p>''He hasn't stated outright that he will veto, but he wanted, and didn't get, two modifications,'' said Dietmar Grellmann, an assistant to the Governor. ''He believes contraceptives should be covered generally, but he doesn't think the law should apply to individual policies, and he wanted a conscience clause that would exempt employers with religious objections.''</p>
        <p>Almost all large group health plans offer prescription drug benefits, but about two-thirds of them exclude contraceptives, treating them as an optional expense.</p>
        <p>Largely because of that exclusion, women pay 68 percent more than men in out-of-pocket expenses for health care, according to a study by the Women's Research and Education Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>The California legislation, which would be the first of its kind in the nation, is being followed closely in Washington, where a similar measure has been introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>Both Hawaii and Virginia have laws requiring insurance companies to offer contraceptive coverage. But a spokeswoman for Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg, who introduced the California legislation, said those laws had little impact, because health plans were allowed to charge extra for such coverage.</p>
        <p>Under the California bill, insurers would cover oral contraceptive pills, diaphragm fittings, Depo Provera shots and insertion of Norplant or intrauterine devices on the same basis as other prescription drugs. Over-the-counter contraceptives, like condoms, would still be an out-of-pocket expense.</p>
        <p>Governor Wilson vetoed an earlier version of the bill, in 1995, because of concerns about its financial impact on small businesses. But an insurance industry study has since found that the cost of extending the prescription benefit would be only about $16 per employee each year. Supporters of the bill say that employers might save money over all by preventing unintended pregnancies.</p>
        <p>According to the American Journal of Public Health, the managed care cost for one year of a contraceptive pill is $422, compared with $5,512 in prenatal care and delivery for each unintended pregnancy carried to term. The insurance industry dropped its opposition to the current bill after agreement was reached that the coverage would apply only to new health plans.</p>
        <p>The most vocal opposition has been from the Roman Catholic Church, which has said that without a conscience clause to exempt employers, like Catholic hospitals, who are opposed to contraception on religious or conscientious grounds, the legislation would interfere with the free exercise of religion.</p>
        <p>In asking Governor Wilson to veto the bill, the California Association of Catholic Hospitals said in a letter on Feb. 2: ''Catholic organizations, as employers, then will have to choose between dropping the prescription drug benefit entirely in order to follow Catholic religious teachings or provide the benefit in disregard of the teachings.''</p>
        <p>But supporters of the bill, including Planned Parenthood and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, say that conscience clauses are impossible to enforce and would create a dangerous precedent under which the religious views of employers could lead to restricting employees' coverage for  blood transfusions or other care.</p>
        <p>''We see it as an oppression clause, not a conscience clause,'' said Ann Marie Wallace, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. ''Why should employers get to impose their religious views on workers?''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the bill also argue that it is short-sighted and illogical for health plans to cover expensive procedures like abortion and sterilization, as most do, but fail to provide coverage for cheaper, reversible forms of birth control.</p>
