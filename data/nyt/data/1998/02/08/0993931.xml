        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article makes me recall how all of this good work started. In the mid-1970's, when the area was in bad shape, Consolidated Edison had the chance to move its headquarters to midtown, to a new building, at a bargain price. Charles Luce, then chairman of Con Edison, decided not to, primarily because he felt that pulling out would mean a severe blow to the area.</p>

        <p>Your article makes me recall how all of this good work started. In the mid-1970's, when the area was in bad shape, Consolidated Edison had the chance to move its headquarters to midtown, to a new building, at a bargain price. Charles Luce, then chairman of Con Edison, decided not to, primarily because he felt that pulling out would mean a severe blow to the area.</p>
        <p>But he also decided to do something about the problems. With the support of the 14th Street merchants' association, Mr. Luce and Dr. John Evert, then president of the New School for Social Research, formed a nonprofit corporation, Sweet Fourteen, which became the BID.</p>
        <p>Con Edison was the largest contributor to Sweet Fourteen, which had office space in its building. Other major contributors at the time were New York Telephone, Guardian Insurance, Citibank, the United Mutual Savings Bank and the Kaplan Foundation.</p>

        <p>The writer retired in 1989 as director of consumer education with Con Ed.</p>
