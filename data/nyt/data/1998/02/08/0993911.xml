        <p>Letter from acting Lebanon (Conn) town historian Alicia Wayland responds to January 18 article on demolition of green in New Milford</p>

        <p>If the New Milford green is one-quarter-mile long (''Enter the Bulldozers, a Face Lift Downtown,'' Jan. 18), it hardly qualifies as the longest in Connecticut. That distinction belongs to the Lebanon green, which is one mile in length.</p>
        <p>Runners along the cinder paths that line each side of the green measure their distance by the number of two-mile laps they make. Walkers of all ages come and go from early morning to late evening, attracted by the special ambience of this vast open space in the town center.</p>

        <p>If the New Milford green is one-quarter-mile long (''Enter the Bulldozers, a Face Lift Downtown,'' Jan. 18), it hardly qualifies as the longest in Connecticut. That distinction belongs to the Lebanon green, which is one mile in length.</p>
        <p>Runners along the cinder paths that line each side of the green measure their distance by the number of two-mile laps they make. Walkers of all ages come and go from early morning to late evening, attracted by the special ambience of this vast open space in the town center.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's town center resembles many picturesque New England villages, with a library, church and town hall clustered at the south end. But the northern section is still in agricultural use, a practice dating from the early settlement period in the 1690's. Here, neighboring farmers can be seen making hay during the summer months.</p>
        <p>Around the green are some of the most important buildings connected with Connecticut's role in the American Revolution, when the town was the home of the War Governor and the focal point of the state's contribution to the patriot cause.</p>
        <p>There are four museums: the Gov. Jonathan Trumbull House, the Revolutionary War Office, the Jonathan Trumbull Jr. House and the Beaumont Homestead, birthplace of Dr. William Beaumont, an early medical researcher. Also to be seen is the First Congregational Church, with its Wren-like steeple designed by John Trumbull, the great artist of the Revolution and the early national period.</p>
        <p>The Lebanon green is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of the 70-some structures in the district, 49 are listed as contributing to the historic character of the green. The oldest of these is the 1712 Welles House, birthplace of William Williams, signer of the Declaration of Independence. The newest is the museum and visitors center now being constructed by the Lebanon Historical Society.</p>
        <p>There are no gazebos, no traffic jams, no malls. Just an ancient green that was the heartbeat of the American Revolution, a place where visitors can feel a part of the past come alive.</p>
        <p>ALICIA WAYLAND</p>
        <p>The writer is acting town historian in Lebanon.</p>
