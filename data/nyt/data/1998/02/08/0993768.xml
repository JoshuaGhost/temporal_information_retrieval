        <p>THE Stamford Museum and Nature Center's newly renovated lobby has been turned into a gallery where small collections can be showcased.</p>
        <p>''Mineral Orbs,'' on view through April 9, spotlights the curtain-raising exhibition in a line of specialty collections. ''Free space will emphasize small-scale objects on a changing basis in years to come,'' said Barbara Scribner, the museum's director of public information.</p>
        <p>In this colorful first, more than 150 polished mineral spheres are set next to their raw mineral sources, shelved in 13 cabinets.</p>
        <p>The museum, part of the former Henri Bendel estate, housed in a castle-like Tudor-style building, has two entrances. This one, off the Fountain Plaza, studded with sculpture, is not without allure.</p>
        <p>Once inside, the lighted cabinets and glittery specimens take over. The display, highlighting the relationship between art and nature, contrasts the color and textural features of raw natural rocks (primarily the museum's collection) with the lustrous, sensual qualities of polished spheres (the on-loan collection of Eric Kreuter).</p>
        <p>Mr. Kreuter, a Somers, N.Y., resident, became intrigued with minerals as works of art and relics of the past. His collection, he said, was furthered by ''the urge to hunt and gather,'' which inspired travels in this country and Europe, to find the orbs.</p>
        <p>''The world, and our region in particular, contains a wide variety of minerals, over 4,000 types,'' Mr. Kreuter pointed out. ''They are found in raw form and quite often in combination with one or more other materials.'' In the exhibition viewers can look for these mineral partnerships.</p>
        <p>The objects are ranged so that they teach something about minerals, rocks and fossils. ''Rocks are made up of combinations of minerals,'' said Pat Standaert, assistant director of education at the museum and curator of the exhibition, offering a definition she uses with children.</p>
        <p>''A rock is like a chocolate chip cookie,'' Ms. Standaert said. ''The whole cookie represents the rock. Inside you can see one of the ingredients: the chocolate chips, which represent the minerals. Minerals are one specialized facet of a rock. For example the most common rock around that is displayed here is granite, made up of three main minerals: quartz, mica and feldspar.'' Viewers are led into a discovery trip of rocks and the minerals of which they are composed.</p>
        <p>There are striking differences between polished and unpolished specimens and among the colors and textures of different minerals. Some orbs are made of rocks, most are of specific minerals and a few are fossils (remnants of an animal or plant that lived millions of years ago.) An example of a fossil on display is petrified wood, shown also in a further metamorphosis into the mineral quartz.</p>
        <p>On one shelf, the curator's favorite, just coppers are found with their glittery colors, the metallic greens of malachite and blues of azurite. One entire case is labeled Calcite Varieties. ''Much of the calcium that makes up the calcite originally came from marine animals,'' Ms. Standaert pointed out. ''The remains of the marine animals over millenniums can form limestone and then the limestone metamorphosed into marble.''</p>
        <p>The well-known, intriguing mineral quartz is shown in spectacular large and small forms in a rainbow of colors -- rose, green, violet and clear. They grow in ornamental crystalline shapes, like pieces of Steuben sculpture, which nature has originated and bested.</p>
        <p>Another eye-catching mineral, snowflake obsidian, is set in raw form next to its transformed orb -- a black polished sphere speckled with snow flakes.</p>
        <p>Viewers will enjoy picking out the more familiar minerals, like turquoise, alabaster, marble, Amazon stone (a blue-green gem), emerald and garnet.</p>
        <p>One case currently in the works, will become a place where polished orbs can be handled; another will feature florescent minerals and orbs.</p>
        <p>''From the science point of view, the minerals are so orderly they fall into groups that can be easily classified,'' Ms. Standaert said. ''From an esthetic perspective, it's intriguing to note the diversity, color, form, sheer beauty and story behind each specimen.</p>
        <p>''When leaving,'' she added, ''people pay more attention to the granite of the building, which came from the adjacent woods.</p>
        <p>''They see the orange and pink as well as shades of gray. It's a crash course in geology.''</p>
        <p>The Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 59 Scofield Town Road, Stamford, is open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
