        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Faith Ebbs on Reader's Digest Stock'' (Market Place column, Jan. 16) fails to focus on the company's performance from 1995 to 1997, which led to the board's decision to bring back George V. Grune as chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>From 1987 to 1994, while Mr. Grune was chief executive, revenues doubled from $1.4 billion to $2.8 billion, and net income rose more than 150 percent from $95 million to $246 million. In the last two of those years, Reader's Digest recorded its highest operating profits ever.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Grune's retirement in 1994, the company's performance declined, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 we experienced our first quarterly operating loss. Operating losses continued through the first quarter of fiscal 1998. The board brought back Mr. Grune and an experienced management team to reverse this course.</p>
        <p>To provide incentives not just for management but for more than 800 key employees, the company revised its compensation structure, eliminating three-year performance cash bonuses, significantly reducing annual cash bonuses and basing future rewards on stock performance. The purpose of this revised structure is to save cash for the company and tie employee compensation more closely to the stock price and the interest of shareholders.</p>
        <p>CRAIG T. MONAGHAN  Vice President and Treasurer  Reader's Digest Association Inc.  Pleasantville, N.Y., Feb. 5, 1998</p>
