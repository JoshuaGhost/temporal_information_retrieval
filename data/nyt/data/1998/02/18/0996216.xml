        <p>The Clintons' first overnight guests in the Lincoln Bedroom were Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creators of the sitcom ''Designing Women.'' Who would've guessed that there was nowhere to go but down?</p>
        <p>Many Streisand and Spielberg soirees later, Bill Clinton's show-biz-entranced Presidency has reached a nadir in which Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, must take time out from saber-rattling with Saddam Hussein to field questions about John Travolta. On last Sunday's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Berger testily explained just why he had wasted his time and taxpayers' money to brief a movie star's delegation, at the President's behest, about the Administration's defense of beleaguered Scientologists in Germany. Mr. Berger's answer -- ''I was trying to get an autograph for one of my kids'' -- is as revealing as it is pitiful. Imagine if a nobody requested a meeting about Christian persecution in China.</p>

        <p>The Clintons' first overnight guests in the Lincoln Bedroom were Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creators of the sitcom ''Designing Women.'' Who would've guessed that there was nowhere to go but down?</p>
        <p>Many Streisand and Spielberg soirees later, Bill Clinton's show-biz-entranced Presidency has reached a nadir in which Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, must take time out from saber-rattling with Saddam Hussein to field questions about John Travolta. On last Sunday's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Berger testily explained just why he had wasted his time and taxpayers' money to brief a movie star's delegation, at the President's behest, about the Administration's defense of beleaguered Scientologists in Germany. Mr. Berger's answer -- ''I was trying to get an autograph for one of my kids'' -- is as revealing as it is pitiful. Imagine if a nobody requested a meeting about Christian persecution in China.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton personally took on Mr. Travolta's pet cause after meeting the actor at last spring's conference on volunteerism. Time broke that story last September, but it was ignored until it resurfaced in the new George magazine. Now that both Bill Clinton and Scientology are defending themselves against scandalous headlines, a question arises: Could the President have offered to pimp for Scientology, currently battling a nasty wrongful-death suit in Florida, in exchange for a more favorable portrayal in the screen version of ''Primary Colors''?</p>
        <p>I think not. ''Primary Colors'' was always going to be kind to Mr. Clinton: Hollywood simply does not cast the beloved Travolta -- or Tom Hanks, the original choice for the Clintonesque hero -- as heavies. (If Tommy Lee Jones or John Malkovich had been rumored to star, then the President would have cause to worry.) But even without a supposed quid pro quo, the fact that Mr. Clinton would blithely do a movie star's flaky bidding is typical of an Administration whose worship of Hollywood money and celebrity has made it blind to avoiding appearances of impropriety. If stars routinely hang out with groupies, why not Presidents with interns?</p>
        <p>The most damning recent document from the Clinton White House doesn't have to be subpoenaed: it's the published guest list for the dinner for Tony Blair. This gala celebration of American-British amity was full of moguls and movie stars and Disney employees (six from Disney's ABC News alone) but bereft of American artists: no novelists or painters or poets. How soulless can a White House get? No point in inviting a Nobel laureate, apparently, when you can have the actor James Brolin, who took the occasion to instruct the press, ''He's the most fun President we've ever had -- I think we can all agree about that.''</p>
        <p>The most incriminating recent White House photo was taken on that same occasion: a Time shot of the Dreamworks mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg hugging Al Gore from behind as Elton John and Hillary Clinton looked on. Don Imus is right to call this smarmy synergy of money and power ''troubling,'' ''revolting'' and ''worse than Sammy Davis Jr. hugging Richard Nixon''; it shows a level of sycophancy between the Vice President and a campaign contributor that is even more revealing than that photo of Mr. Gore and the Buddhist nuns. Mr. Katzenberg may not be pushing Scientology, but will the White House lend its imprimatur to the hype for Dreamworks's potentially make-or-break new animated film, ''Prince of Egypt''?</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are in such thrall to their Hollywood patrons that they have no sense of how their infatuation plays or to what embarrassments it can lead. At the Blair dinner, the evening's entertainers, Mr. John and Stevie Wonder -- whose services were ''said to have been procured by Jeffrey Katzenberg,'' as another dinner guest, Tina Brown, tellingly put it in The New Yorker -- concluded their show by singing the old Motown-Beatles hit ''Money.'' Remember its lyric? ''Gimme money, that's what I want!''</p>
        <p>If you have a show-biz Administration, you are asking to get stuck with ''Money'' as your theme song, even at the height of scandals that include bags of possibly ill-gotten campaign cash. In this crass atmosphere, Mr. Clinton's alleged gift of Walt Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass'' to Monica Lewinsky may be as close to a cultural Camelot as his White House gets.</p>
