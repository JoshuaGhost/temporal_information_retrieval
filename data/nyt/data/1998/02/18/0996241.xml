      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial calls for end to Senate practice that lets individual lawmaker impose secret 'hold' on items, blocking their consideration indefinitely; backs bill by Sens Ron Wyden and Charles Grassley to require senators to disclose holds in Congressional Record within 48 hours (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Congress is a public institution, and members who use their power to prevent action on legislation or nominations should have to do so in the open. That basic principle of accountability seems to have been lost on the Senate, which allows individual lawmakers to impose a secret ''hold'' on items they object to, thereby blocking their consideration indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Many senators cherish this prerogative for the leverage it affords to extract concessions from the White House, Federal agencies and fellow senators. But there is no excuse for secret holds that turn the legislative process into an undignified detective game in which senators canvass their colleagues to figure out who held their legislation and then retaliate with an anonymous hold of their own.</p>

        <p>Congress is a public institution, and members who use their power to prevent action on legislation or nominations should have to do so in the open. That basic principle of accountability seems to have been lost on the Senate, which allows individual lawmakers to impose a secret ''hold'' on items they object to, thereby blocking their consideration indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Many senators cherish this prerogative for the leverage it affords to extract concessions from the White House, Federal agencies and fellow senators. But there is no excuse for secret holds that turn the legislative process into an undignified detective game in which senators canvass their colleagues to figure out who held their legislation and then retaliate with an anonymous hold of their own.</p>
        <p>Shortly before adjourning last year, the Senate quietly killed a remedial measure. The measure stopped short of abolishing the hold system entirely, but would at least have opened it up somewhat by requiring that senators place a notice in the Congressional Record within 48 hours of issuing any  hold.</p>
        <p>The reform's chief sponsors, Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have now resumed the fight. Along with 11 colleagues, including Orrin Hatch, a Republican and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, they have sent a letter to the majority leader, Trent Lott, urging him to support a prompt rule change eliminating secret holds. Their proposal deserves support from all who care about open government.</p>
