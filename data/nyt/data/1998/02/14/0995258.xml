        <p>A group of investors has signed a contract to buy the tower at 48 Wall Street, the downtown home of the Bank of New York, for a surprising $37.5 million. The deal comes after the kind of grueling two-stage auction that has become the favored blood sport of investors, real estate moguls and Wall Street bankers in the current hot market.</p>
        <p>Late Thursday afternoon, the bank signed a contract to sell the downtown building to a joint venture of the investors Kent M. Swig and David A. Burris and the Corsair Group, a real estate investment bank, according to real estate executives involved in the bidding. The group plans to convert the 70-year-old Renaissance Revival building, which is topped by a massive sculpture of an eagle, to an apartment house with some commercial space in the base of the tower, the executives said.</p>
        <p>The fight over the property reflects both the intense speculation in New York real estate and a small but rising fear that the market is out of control. Two years ago, buildings in lower Manhattan, where the vacancy rate topped 25 percent, sold for practically nothing. But sale prices have escalated so rapidly since then that some observers are saying it is almost impossible to make money.</p>
        <p>''Based on downtown rents,'' said Phillip A. Gesue, director of acquisitions for Crescent Heights Investments, ''the sales numbers I'm seeing in the New York market don't make sense.''</p>
        <p>In early 1995, Crescent Heights paid $5.5 million, or $10.48 a square foot, for a nearby office building at 25 Broad Street in lower Manhattan. The company successfully converted the 525,000-square-foot property to 345 apartments.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Bank of New York is selling 48 Wall Street for $122.55 a square foot, more than 10 times the amount paid by Crescent.</p>
        <p>Carl Weisbrod, president of the business improvement district Alliance for Downtown New York, took a more optimistic view, citing the renewed interest in lower Manhattan and the fact that little new housing or office space has been built in recent years. He said that 2,500 apartments have been created in former downtown office buildings since 1995 and that another 1,500 are scheduled to be built this year.</p>
        <p>''This is a further indication of the strength of the downtown market,'' Mr. Weisbrod said, ''and confirmation of the ongoing interest in residential conversions downtown.''</p>
        <p>Initially, more than 20 bidders competed for 48 Wall Street. Earlier this week, the list was pared to less than 10 for another wild round of bidding. In an odd but increasingly common twist, Credit Suisse First Boston, one of the most aggressive real estate lenders in New York, backed several of the bidders.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Leyden, a spokesman for the Bank of New York, confirmed that ''we have signed a contract'' to sell 48 Wall Street, but he said he could not name the buyer or provide any details. Darcy A. Stacom, an executive director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield who represented the bank, did not return calls requesting comment, and Mr. Swig refused to comment.</p>
        <p>The sale of 48 Wall Street represents a major cultural shift for one of New York's oldest banks. The bank's shares are the oldest stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, the Bank of New York built the first of three towers at the northeast corner of Wall and William Streets in 1797. The current tower was built in 1928 and retains much of its architectural detail, including 12-foot ceilings and a banking room with a vaulted ceiling and large arched windows.</p>
        <p>The bank's enduring and staid corporate culture is epitomized by a boardroom story about Alexander Hamilton's advice to the bank's officers as he left in 1804 for his ill-fated duel with Aaron Burr in Weehawken, N.J. ''Don't do anything until I return,'' he reportedly said. According to the story, the bank took his advice to heart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leyden chuckled. ''That's not true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In any event, the Bank of New York is finally moving off a corner it has held for 200 years.</p>
