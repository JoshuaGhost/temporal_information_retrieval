        <p>Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday, particularly among longer maturities, as the stock market surged on the heels of a rally in Asia, drawing investors away from bonds. The short end of the Treasury market, however, was also lower, but its losses were limited by a tame manufacturing report.</p>
        <p>The selloff in bonds came on the eve of the start of a two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers. Talks that the Fed might cut interest rates has faded in recent weeks, and with inflation still benign, most market participants expect no action at all this week.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 13/32 , or more than $10 for each $1,000 invested in bonds, to 1039/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.87 percent, from 5.80 percent on Friday.</p>
        <p>The bond market was weighed down at the opening by a sharp rebound in Asian stock markets, which lured investors out of the relative safety of the Treasury market and back into equities.</p>
        <p>Losses in bonds were somewhat trimmed after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its January index fell to 52.4 percent from 53.1 percent, weaker than expected. The prices-paid component of the index dropped sharply to 44.7 percent from 50.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said the purchasing managers' report indicated a trade-related moderation but not a drastic slowdown in United States economic growth. The price-paid component provided further evidence that overall price inflation should not be a problem despite the recent increase in labor costs, he said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Fed policy meeting, this week the market will also have to contend with the January employment report on Friday. ''I expect a gain of between 265,000 to 275,000 jobs, with unemployment at 4.6 percent, and provided that there is no change on the domestic and international news, the market should trade in a narrow band until Friday,'' said Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The Treasury's weekly sale of three-month and six-month bills yesterday came in as expected. Following are the results of the auction:</p>
