        <p>Resurgent stock markets in Asia and merger news in Europe gave American stocks a powerful lift yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 200 points and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index reaching a record.</p>
        <p>Both market indexes exceeded psychological barriers -- the Dow closed above 8,000 for the first time since early December and the S.&amp; P. 500 surpassed 1,000 for the first time.</p>
        <p>Investors took heart from developments in Asia, where markets ignited yesterday after holidays in much of the region last week. Helping fuel those markets was the agreement reached by South Korea and foreign banks to stretch out the repayment of short-term debt by Korea's conglomerates and banks.</p>
        <p>Also, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said yesterday that quick intervention by the International Monetary Fund had contained the Asian crisis. Though no one was saying the worst was over, and many problems remain unresolved, including a debt repayment plan for Indonesia, the sense of panic has eased.</p>
        <p>Trading in London was brisk after SmithKline Beecham announced late Friday that it was in merger talks with Glaxo Wellcome. Their combination would create the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world.</p>
        <p>Along with Asian relief and merger fever, American stocks were aided by earnings reports that came in largely as expected.</p>
        <p>''The fears were that Asia was going to decimate corporate profits, but that's not happening,'' said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Company, who says that stocks, especially small ones, are set to move higher.</p>
        <p>In their first trading sessions since the Lunar New Year's holiday, stock markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia rose more than 10 percent. The South Korean market, which was open during the holiday, was lower.</p>
        <p>''There's a real sense that the liquidity part of the squeeze is being addressed forcefully,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Most drug companies ended higher, and the Morgan Stanley health care product index rose 3.8 percent. The exception was American Home Products, which had been discussing a merger with SmithKline Beecham until that company announced Friday that it was talking to Glaxo Wellcome and had ended negotiations with American Home.</p>
        <p>The Dow closed at 8,107.78, up 201.28 points, or 2.55 percent. It is now 151.53 points away from its record close of 8,259.31 on Aug. 6. The S.&amp; P. 500 soared 20.99 points, to 1,001.27, a 2.1 percent gain. Volume was hefty, at 731.2 million shares.</p>
        <p>In addition to drug stocks, bank and technology issues had a stellar day. The Amex broker/dealer index rose 4.5 percent, as multinational banks and securities firms benefited from the stronger Asian markets and from the prospect of ever more fees from merger work.</p>
        <p>High-profile technology shares -- Oracle, Intel, Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Dell Computer and Applied Materials -- were among the most actively traded issues and helped push the Nasdaq composite index up 2.07 percent, or 33.53 points, to 1,652.89.</p>
        <p>Compaq Computer, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, was the most heavily traded issue.</p>
        <p>Amid the market surge, two well-known strategists -- Byron Wien of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter and Greg Smith of Prudential -- reduced the portion of assets that they recommend investors hold in cash and called for shifts into equities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wien, known for his bearish sentiment, cut his recommended cash position to 3 percent from 8 percent, and Mr. Smith shifted his entire cash position, 5 percent, into equities, for a total stock allocation of 65 percent.</p>
        <p>Despite this, some portfolio managers are standing pat.</p>
        <p>''We're still looking to be a little defensive this year,'' said Betty K. Taylor, a managing director and portfolio manager at Investment Counselors of Bryn Mawr, Pa., which  primarily advises wealthy individuals. Earlier this year, the firm increased its recommended cash position to 15 percent from 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The market yesterday simply discounted all the problems of last week, she said, pointing to the scandals in Washington, the possibility of American military action in Iraq and the Asian financial crisis.</p>
        <p>While about 50 percent of companies have exceeded analysts' expectations for fourth-quarter earnings, that represents a decline from previous quarters, said Thomas Galvin, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. About 55 percent exceeded expectations in previous quarters, according to the First Call Corporation. ''The earnings quality is slipping,'' Mr. Galvin concluded.</p>
        <p>The rally could stall in March as companies begin warning of disappointments for the first quarter of 1998. ''The reality is that Asia and Latin America continue to stagnate, and that will lead to slower growth,'' Mr. Galvin said.</p>
