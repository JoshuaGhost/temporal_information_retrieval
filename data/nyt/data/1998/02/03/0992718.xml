        <p>Three of the largest embroidery and lace manufacturers in the United States -- Carolace Industries, Clover Trimmings and Huber Lace &amp; Embroidery, all based in the New York City metropolitan region -- announced yesterday that they would merge.</p>
        <p>The combined company will be the single largest embroidery and lace manufacturer in the nation, company officials said, with anticipated annual sales of about $50 million by 2000.</p>
        <p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>''Our consolidation will serve to strengthen our respective positions in the marketplace, which over the past decade has been deeply affected by unfair foreign competition,'' said David Mann, the chairman and chief executive officer of Carolace.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Carolace, Rob Kulat, added that the companies had been competing with state-subsidized lace and embroidery companies in Asia, Turkey and Mexico. He said that sales had declined slightly at Carolace in recent years and by about 30 percent industrywide because of foreign competition. ''Nafta has killed us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kulat said the companies did not expect to cut their work forces, which will total about 740, because of the merger.</p>
        <p>Clover Trimmings, which specializes in novelty embroidery, patches and medallion embroidery, and Huber Lace &amp; Embroidery, which specializes in lace trimmings, are based in Manhattan. The companies will operate as separate units of Carolace Industries of Ridgefield, N.J., which produces embroidery and lace products. The company said it also produced more than 50 million stars annually for flags, including those that fly over the United States Capitol and the White House.</p>
