        <p>Paul Griffiths reviews performance by young Armenian cellist Alexander Chaushian (S)</p>

        <p>Alexander Chaushian, barely out of his teens, is a fine cellist, and a worthy first recipient of the Young Concert Artists' Summis Auspiciis Prize, to be given to those ''with highest expectations.'' In his case, though, the expectations are already being met. He has played concertos not only with the Philharmonic of his native Armenia but also with leading orchestras in Europe, and has given recitals at important venues. He arrived at the 92d Street Y on Tuesday evening as a highly accomplished performer, proficient in everything except choosing an accompanist.</p>
        <p>He showed the scale and range of his talent best in the Shostakovich Sonata. The slow movement was particularly impressive: poignant yet also noble in tone, given nobility by Mr. Chaushian's firmly sustained phrasing. But he was excellent all through the piece. He can be dexterous and he can be insistent, and he can be both at once, as this sonata often demands.</p>

He arrived at the 92d Street Y on Tuesday evening as a highly accomplished performer, proficient in everything except choosing an accompanist.</p>
        <p>He showed the scale and range of his talent best in the Shostakovich Sonata. The slow movement was particularly impressive: poignant yet also noble in tone, given nobility by Mr. Chaushian's firmly sustained phrasing. But he was excellent all through the piece. He can be dexterous and he can be insistent, and he can be both at once, as this sonata often demands.</p>
        <p>In Brahms's F major Sonata, he was not quite at the same high level, but probably only because in this work Wendy Chen's clattering piano was more obstructive. His efforts at long-lined lyricism were frustrated by her shortness of breath, and in a work that should be a partnership there simply was no such thing.</p>
        <p>The lean beauty of Mr. Chaushian's singing line, and the graceful gravity of his ruminations, came across much better in George Crumb's early unaccompanied Sonata, whose first movement had a very Crumbesque nocturnal sound.</p>
        <p>At the end there was Paganini's ''Variations on One String on a Theme by Rossini,'' as adapted by Luigi Silva for the cello's A string rather than the G string of the violin. This is a wonderful piece of nonsense, perhaps more an encore piece than the finale to a recital program, but thoroughly enjoyable here for Mr. Chaushian's darting runs and whistling harmonics.</p>
