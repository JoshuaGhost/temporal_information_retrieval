        <p>Letter by Steve Kogan disputes Marlise Simons's Dec 21, 1997 travel article on visiting England's Durham Cathedral; Simons responds8</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Marlise Simons errs in describing the celebrated church at Durham as ''this great Romanesque cathedral.'' The cathedral is justly famous as a transitional work and is one of the finest examples of early Gothic in Europe. The up-thrusting lines on the facade throughout, the particular design quality of those lines, the expanses of stained glass, and the vaulting all signal the advent of the Gothic.</p>
        <p>To cite briefly Sir Banister Fletcher's ''History of Architecture'' (19th edition, 1987), the ''original vaults were first in Europe to be built over the main volume of a church. Very influential in Normandy and northern France where the system formed a central feature of the newly developing Gothic style.''</p>

        <p>To cite briefly Sir Banister Fletcher's ''History of Architecture'' (19th edition, 1987), the ''original vaults were first in Europe to be built over the main volume of a church. Very influential in Normandy and northern France where the system formed a central feature of the newly developing Gothic style.''</p>
        <p>A building of comparable date and historical significance is the Abbey of St. Denis near Paris, which reflects earlier models yet stands at the beginning of something entirely new, as do a number of 12th-century churches along the Normandy coast and Durham itself.</p>
        <p>STEVE  KOGAN  Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simons responds: In the past, historians were sometimes at odds over whether Durham Cathedral marked the end of Romanesque or the beginning of Gothic architecture. But the view of contemporary historians, based on new research and interpretations, is that Durham belongs to the Romanesque period and is indeed its crowning achievement.</p>
        <p>Sir Banister Fletcher's views on a number of points are now considered out of date; his ''History of Architecture,'' although revised several times, was first published in 1896. The ''expanses of stained glass'' to which you refer were added much later. The cathedral's history shows that most windows were built very small, in Romanesque style. The major windows were added only in the 14th and 15th centuries.</p>
        <p>Construction at Durham began in 1093, while the building of the apse at St. Denis, widely recognized as the first Gothic church, began in 1136.</p>
