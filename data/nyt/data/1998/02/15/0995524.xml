        <p>TAKAKO AND HIDEAKI KAMBE, who came to New York from Japan 11 years ago, were shopping for an apartment, and their criteria were familiar to anyone looking to rent in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''We requested a spacious place and cheap rent,'' said Ms. Kambe, a freelance journalist, musician and part-time teacher.</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village residents, they were losing their studio sublet and wanted to to stay in the neighborhood or nearby. They wanted more work space for Mr. Kambe, an artist. And, they said, the advertisements made it look like that might be possible.</p>
        <p>''The advertisement said huge studio or one-bedroom, but he went there and found out they were very small,'' said Ms. Kambe, citing an example of 250 square feet for over $1,000. They responded to more than 40 ads, including ones for former commercial space around Chelsea.</p>
        <p>''He was getting frustrated,'' said Cassandra Cwik, an agent with the Citi Habitats agency, who worked with the couple.</p>
        <p>They wanted a rent below $1,200. As an option, Ms. Cwik suggested a three-bedroom apartment at 103d Street and Madison Avenue. The apartment, at 1514 Madison, had 900 square feet and cost $850 a month.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cwik and Mr. Kambe took the subway uptown. ''It took like a half hour,'' she remembered. She was not optimistic it would work out.</p>
        <p>The next day Mr. Kambe took his wife to see the apartment. ''She was a little hesitant at first because of the area,'' Ms. Cwik said, adding that security was a valid concern.</p>
        <p>However, she said, ''I had a friend who lived up there, and I had been through there many times and never had a problem. A lot of people just judge it by how it looks.''</p>
        <p>To address their safety concerns, Mr. Kambe spoke with a friend who is a doctor at Mount Sinai Medical Center, a block from the apartment, and the doctor told him the neighborhood wasn't so bad. He also visited the neighborhood at midnight to see what it was like. Although the apartment is across from public housing and there were some people apparently loitering in the street, street-level shops in the building were open and active, he said, giving it a more secure feel.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the couple's desire for space won out over concerns about safety. But safety wasn't the only consideration, Ms. Kambe said. The apartment, into which they moved in October, is a fifth-floor walkup.</p>
        <p>''No elevator,'' she said.</p>
        <p>THE prewar building is a bit dilapidated, and the couple took up the carpet in their apartment and refinished the floors to improve its appearance. As a tradeoff they got an apartment brighter than the one they had in the Village. They have a room just for Mr. Kambe's canvases and another for their computer, her bass, keyboards and a couch.</p>
        <p>For the first few months, Ms. Kambe -- who plays bass in a Japanese band called Kagero using the name Momiji -- would carry a cellular phone when she was out at night and call in on heading home.</p>
        <p>The couple also changed the locks and put bars over windows that seemed vulnerable. ''I worried about the safety of the area,'' Mr. Kambe said. But gradually their fears have given way to curiosity. One of the best discoveries, Mr. Kambe said, was the apartment's location just a block from Central Park, which has become part of his art.</p>
        <p>In his studio a large acrylic painting takes center stage. Against a background of bright red and orange dots is a gigantic painted tree stump. A computer-altered photograph of the stump -- obviously the model for the painting -- is stuck on the front.  ''I shot this photo in Central Park,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The couple are getting acquainted with other cultures, and are finding those cultures to be equally curious about theirs. ''We have Spanish-speaking neighbors,'' Mr. Kambe said. ''They are very friendly, but there are no other Orientals, so everyone is watching us.''</p>
        <p>One night they ventured out to a neighborhood restaurant. The menu was entirely in Spanish, and Ms. Kambe asked which dish was chicken. ''The waitress said she didn't understand my English,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But they were obviously delighted by the experience of having no idea what they were ordering. ''We felt like we had gone on a trip to another country,'' Ms. Kambe said.</p>
