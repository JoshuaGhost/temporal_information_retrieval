        <p>A BRUSH and a roller are sufficient for painting most projects, but for jobs that are large or have intricate surface detail, it's easier to spray the paint onto the work surface. Spray painting is less tedious than brush painting and it generally gives a smoother, uniform paint surface.</p>
        <p>There are downsides to spray painting however; spray painting is not economical, in fact it can be downright wasteful. That's because only a fraction of the paint is actually deposited on the work surface, the rest is distributed as airborne particles called overspray. Depending upon the spray setup, it is possible for as much as 75 percent of the paint to be lost in overspray.</p>

        <p>A BRUSH and a roller are sufficient for painting most projects, but for jobs that are large or have intricate surface detail, it's easier to spray the paint onto the work surface. Spray painting is less tedious than brush painting and it generally gives a smoother, uniform paint surface.</p>
        <p>There are downsides to spray painting however; spray painting is not economical, in fact it can be downright wasteful. That's because only a fraction of the paint is actually deposited on the work surface, the rest is distributed as airborne particles called overspray. Depending upon the spray setup, it is possible for as much as 75 percent of the paint to be lost in overspray.</p>
        <p>There are two types of sprayer units, air-powered units and airless ones. Air-powered units can be costly (prices will vary depending upon the size of the compressor, but a basic unit will cost around $200) because they require an air gun and a compressor unit. Air-powered sprayers allow you to spray a variety of finishes and are a better choice for fine work. Airless sprayers are considerably cheaper than the air units, but they produce sprays with large, heavy paint particles so they are not good for laying down a really smooth finish.</p>
        <p>Air-powered units work by blowing a stream of compressed air at high pressure through the nozzle of the gun. The paint is forced up into the air stream where it is atomized into a fine mist that is deposited on the work surface. There are two types of air-driven guns: siphon feed and pressure feed.</p>
        <p>In siphon-feed guns, the compressed air creates a partial vacuum as it passes though the paint tube near the gun nozzle. Outside air pressure enters the paint cup (the metal can that screws onto the nozzle unit) through a small inlet hole and forces the paint up to fill the vacuum. It is then forced out through the nozzle by the compressed air. Siphon-feed guns are ideal for blowing out lightweight paints and finishes and therefore are a good choice for extra-fine work, but they can only draw paint from the attached paint cup, so the user is forced to periodically stop painting and refill the cup when painting large projects.</p>
        <p>Pressure-feed guns do not create a vacuum, instead they channel some of the compressed air directly into the paint reservoir. The increased air pressure forces the paint up into the nozzle where it is propelled out as a mist. These guns create high internal air pressure so they can be hooked up to a remote pressure tank making it unnecessary to stop painting to refill the paint cup. They can also handle heavier paints, so they are a better choice for big outdoor jobs.</p>
        <p>Spray guns are also classified as bleeder or non-bleeder types. Bleeder guns pass air through the nozzle as long as the compressor is running -- only the paint flow can be turned on or off. This type of gun is designed for use with a compressor that does not have an air reservoir. The non-bleeder guns can stop the flow of air with the trigger control and are designed for use with a compressor equipped with a storage tank.</p>
        <p>Airless sprayers have an electric motor that drives an internal piston back and forth in the gun. As the piston is pulled back, suction is created and it pulls the paint up into the nozzle. The forward piston stroke forces the paint through an orifice that atomizes it into a mist. Airless sprayers do not produce the fine paint mist that air-powered units deliver, so there is less overspray and more paint is deposited.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the sprayer that you choose, you need to prepare the work surface, working area and even the paint before you can start painting. Preparing the work surface involves scraping, sanding and cleaning it, and also masking those areas that are not to be painted. It is not always necessary to mask all areas; you can hold a large piece of cardboard as a shield to block the overspray from hitting places you don't want painted. Preparing the work area entails laying down dropcloths and erecting barriers to keep the overspray confined.</p>
        <p>Filter all paints before loading them into the spray gun. Even new paint can have large particles that have coagulated into globs; if they are not removed, they will clog the gun. They can be strained out by pouring the paint through a commercial strainer or through an old nylon stocking.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, spray painting can be dangerous. High-pressure sprayers shoot paint with enough force to penetrate the skin. Protect yourself by donning the proper safety gear. Wear a respirator designed for paint spraying (not a dust mask), a long-sleeved shirt, goggles and gloves.</p>
