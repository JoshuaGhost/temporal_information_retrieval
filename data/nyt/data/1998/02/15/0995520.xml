        <p>RESIDENTS of several upscale New York suburbs have acquired neighbors in recent years that many never expected -- large rental apartment buildings.</p>
        <p>A number of suburbs that had vigorously resisted multifamily housing for decades -- towns known in the apartment development industry as ''high-barrier-to-entry communities,'' zoned to protect land from unwelcome development -- are now or are soon to be the sites of apartment complexes with hundreds of rental units. And almost all the units are the work of one deep-pocketed development company, Avalon Properties, whose only business is building luxury apartments for rent.</p>
        <p>New Canaan in Fairfield County and Bronxville in Westchester County are two such communities in which rental developments are now being prepared by Avalon, a five-year-old company based in Wilton, Conn.</p>
        <p>Since 1993 Avalon has built 15 complexes containing from 102 to 932 apartments each in Fairfield and Westchester, on Long Island and in New Jersey -- and it is developing 20 additional complexes in the same areas with the potential for a total of 6,022 units.</p>
        <p>Its success has been won at a cost of millions of dollars spent on legal battles with communities that want no part of multifamily housing, no matter how luxurious.</p>
        <p>The company is viewed by many local ad hoc groups as a tiger at the gate, bent on destroying their way of life by bringing what they perceive as rootless transients into their tranquil single-family, large-lot, residential neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Such groups become particularly agitated when a designated percentage of the apartments is reserved for lower-income tenants, in accordance with laws in several states that give developers greater density in return for providing units below market rates.</p>
        <p>The 1989 Affordable Housing Law in Connecticut allows developers extra units in return for setting aside 25 percent of a project at lower rents. Municipalities seeking to reject these projects must prove in court that they will be injurious to the town's welfare. So far, none has.</p>
        <p>Lawsuits brought by Avalon against the Fairfield County towns of Trumbull and New Canaan resulted in four and six years, respectively, of litigation, compromises and eventual victory for the developer.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't the project itself or Avalon that we objected to,'' said Kenneth Halaby, a former chairman of Trumbull's Planning and Zoning Commission. ''The complex is a fine addition to the town, beautifully built and very upscale. What we resented was the state telling us how many affordable housing units we must have and where. We have our own master plan to provide for this, and we have to be careful because Trumbull is fully developed.''</p>
        <p>New Canaan tried to take an Avalon site by condemnation, defying court rulings against its efforts to reject the developer's 104-unit project. Eventually, the town and developer swapped sites and Avalon is now going through the approval process.</p>
        <p>''Friction will continue when developers go into more rural communities,'' said Richard Bond, New Canaan's First Selectman, or chief executive, ''but people do have to break out of a box of conventional thinking to make things work for all parties involved. That's what we tried to do.''</p>
        <p>In Wilton, another affluent Fairfield County community, ''they said these apartments are needed for residents to retire to and young people to start out,'' said Richard L. Michaux, 54, Avalon's chairman of the board and chief executive. But Wilton stiffened its regulations after the 102-unit Avalon Springs complex was built. The town now requires a public hearing solely for site plans in cases where properties like Avalon's are zoned for multifamily development.</p>
        <p>Other developers find it difficult to match Avalon's product in size, quality, amenities and service, in part because ''it's very difficult to compete with their ability to amass capital,'' said Clay Fowler, principal of the Spinnaker Companies in Stamford. The company owns and manages 1,300 luxury apartments in Fairfield County, with 400 more for Norwalk and White Plains in the design stage. ''They clearly have a predominant position and an insatiable appetite for new projects,'' said Mr. Fowler.</p>
        <p>His Stamford complex, called The Fairfield, has 263 units with a pool, lounge, fitness center, and barbecue area. He is building rentals in Portland, Ore., and Seattle in partnership with Carl Kuehner, a Wilton builder of luxury homes. Mr. Kuehner, who sold a Danbury parcel to Avalon, said Avalon was ''better at managing these products than we are, and have a much larger portfolio than we will ever choose to have.''</p>
        <p>In order to acquire a site in Bronxville, Avalon formed a partnership with Arthur Collins, a developer of high-end residential condominiums in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and the South. Mr. Collins had entree to the town, which he described as ''very hard to deal with in terms of approvals.''</p>
        <p>''We had the right project at the right time,'' he said, ''and were the right people to do it.''</p>
        <p>Avalon is obtaining access to land and towns through other builders ''because they can't acquire land fast enough to meet their need to use capital,'' said Mr. Fowler.</p>
        <p>Ross Cassata, builder of 3,200 Long Island rentals over 37 years, views Avalon as ''one of our main competitors.''</p>
        <p>''Lately we are refocusing on luxury garden apartments with similar amenities,'' he said. ''Being a public company they have deeper pockets and work on a slim profit margin of 7 or 8 percent, beating us out of some properties.''</p>
        <p>But Bryce Blair, 40, senior vice president for development and acquisition at Avalon, said his company's profits were 10 to 13 percent.</p>
        <p>PROFITS derived from standardized designs and bulk purchasing are supplemented through such details as ''gas heating and cooking because what people save on utility bills they can spend on rent,'' said Samuel B. Fuller, 36, Avalon's Northeast regional vice president of development and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Lately, Avalon has been entering communities closer to New York and other major cities.</p>
        <p>''We're being invited in by the New Rochelles of the world,'' said Mr. Michaux, Avalon's chief executive, ''to help revitalize their downtowns with housing. That's something we're seeing more and more of.'' New Rochelle accepted Avalon's proposal to build a 1,000-apartment complex and ground-floor shops in four buildings near the railroad station.</p>
        <p>Michael Barry, vice president of The Applied Companies of Hoboken, a builder of rental apartments in New Jersey for 30 years, said that ''Avalon is developing in some of our areas.''</p>
        <p>''We're just a few blocks from each other in Jersey City, but we view it as friendly competition,'' said Mr. Barry. ''The more development and investment in an area the better it is for everybody.''</p>
        <p>On Jersey City's riverfront, Avalon is building its first high-rise, a 26-story complex called Avalon Cove South, next door to its mid-rise Avalon Cove, where rents reach $4,000 a month.</p>
        <p>A competitor, Roseland Properties of Roseland, N.J., has approvals for 4,360 units over the next decade at Port Imperial in West New York, N.J. ''We will have one-, two-  and three-bedroom luxury apartments in several mid-  and high-rise buildings, with pools, business centers and health clubs,'' said Carl Goldberg, principal in the firm. Roseland owns 3,500 units around the state and manages 6,000 more. ''We completed a second Port Towers in Jersey City close to the Avalon project,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Avalon Cove is the highest end of the luxury rental market,'' said Thomas M. Gallagher, director of Jersey City's Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce. ''Their units are a little larger and they provide a high level of amenities on site. Residents at that income level are willing to pay a premium for that.''</p>
        <p>''I think other developers have responded,'' he continued, ''and tried to offer more. The Hudson County waterfront is very competitive, and when anyone is willing to test the outer limits of the market and been successful, as Avalon has, you'll see other developers follow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Michaux said Avalon had embraced the policy of ''smart growth,'' typically in  Stamford, where the company has built its 402-unit Avalon Grove complex near the  Stamford Town Center, theaters and restaurants.</p>
        <p>''We think there's a better way to enjoy a community environment, where you can walk to work, retail, nightlife, and not have to get in the car to do all your errands.''</p>
        <p>The term ''smart growth'' was originated by the Urban Land Institute in Washington a nonprofit educational organization advocating high-density housing in suburban sprawl areas, situated near public transportation and utilizing existing infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Some academicians who study the residential construction industry agree with the concept for additional reasons. ''Avalon is onto something,'' said Catherine Pancak, professor of real estate at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. ''The state has been underserved by well-built, high-quality rental apartment complexes, so there is a strong demand. Historically we've had high house prices, making ownership less attractive as an option, and that will continue.''</p>
        <p>Dr. James W. Hughes, professor of planning and public policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., acknowledges the demand but recognizes the reasons behind local opposition. ''Larger apartments with school-age children produce a net loss to a town,'' he said. ''Communities with limited or no public sewers and water are afraid of having to extend or build them, setting up a model for greater density and the loss of rural character. And in more developed suburbs, the sites being built on are the last greenfields around. A lot of residents want to see them remain that way.''</p>
        <p>THE only community to date from which Avalon withdrew because of local antipathy and land acquisition problems is Rye Brook, a Westchester enclave of upper income residents that incorporated in 1982, separating itself from the largely working-class Village of Port Chester.</p>
        <p>Rejection of multifamily projects is more prevalent in the Northeast than in the Mid-Atlantic region and the South, where garden apartments originated. ''Opposition,'' said  Charles H. Berman, 44, president and chief operating officer of Avalon, ''comes from what is increasingly referred to in the industry as CAVE, Citizens Against Virtually Everything. It doesn't matter whether it's a new golf course, road, school improvement, or public amenity. Depending on the leadership in a town, a community can be paralyzed to a point that change doesn't occur. That makes some people happy, but I'm not sure it's the majority; it's just the most vocal.''</p>
        <p>Avalon was organized in 1993 as a real estate investment trust and named after the legendary resting place of King Arthur. Currently capitalized at $2.1 billion, it operates from offices in Alexandria and Richmond, Va.; Braintree, Mass.; Princeton, N.J.; Chicago and Minneapolis, as well as Wilton.</p>
        <p>But its genesis goes back to the 80's, when Mr. Berman and Mr. Michaux were regional partners of Trammell Crow, then the largest rental housing developer in the country. Mr. Berman headed the Northeast division, Mr. Michaux was in charge of the Mid-Atlantic region. Given the tortuous process of borrowing what little money was available from insurance companies and pension funds in the early 90's, the two men decided to go public with their own company when Trammell Crow chose to remain private. An amicable arrangement was reached whereby the partners bought out the two divisions that they headed with proceeds from the sale of stock, acquiring 8,500 apartments from Boston to Virginia.</p>
        <p>Last month Avalon bought 60 percent of Trammell Crow's Midwest assets for $196 million. Last year Trammell Crow sold off half of its $3 billion in real estate assets to various REITs. The Avalon partners are now larger than their former parent.</p>
        <p>''We sold because it's a great year to be a seller,'' said Ronald Terwilliger, national managing partner of Trammell Crow Residential in Atlanta. ''We've watched this REIT phenomenon grow. It looks like it's here to stay, but I enjoy being private. In terms of wealth creation it's a better place to be.''</p>
        <p>Avalon is currently the largest residential landlord in Connecticut and arguably the sixth largest developer and manager of luxury rental housing in the country, with 19,724 luxury apartments in 66 complexes in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Its stock, a substantial amount of which is owned by the Crow family, rose from the initial public offering of $20.50 to $29.25 at the close last Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Typically, Avalon builds generic low-rise garden complexes designed by Niles Bolton Associates of Atlanta. Units are arranged around landscaped courtyards, or, in more urban areas, contained in mid-rise and high-rise structures, presenting an exterior that is architecturally harmonious with its surroundings.</p>
        <p>They are larded with amenities that include pools, indoor basketball and squash courts, clubhouses with kitchens for parties, fitness and computer centers, children's playgrounds, an in-house service staff, and a concierge who will arrange for dry-cleaning and car rental, accept packages, walk the dog and feed the cat.</p>
        <p>RENTS range from $1,000 to $4,000 a month depending on location, size and amenities, and dissatisfied tenants are hard to find, perhaps because the management allows them to break their leases, retrieve their security deposits and move out, as long as they do it within the first 30 days of the lease. Occupancy rates average 95.6 percent and tenant turnover is around 50 percent a year.</p>
        <p>Last year Britton and Poonam Manasco and their 21-month-old son moved from California to a two-bedroom apartment at Avalon Grove in downtown Stamford. Growing up in Hong Kong and having lived in New York, Mrs. Manasco likes urban life. ''We plan to stay a year, but if something bigger comes up we may take it,'' she said. ''The management is so nice. They helped me start a children's play group.''</p>
        <p>Miguel and Monica Mancevo live at the 504-unit Avalon Cove in Jersey City. ''It's only a 20-minute drive to my office on East 40th Street,'' said Mr. Mancevo, ''and when I come home late at night I feel safe, comfortable.'' Their 11-year-old son, Mark, ''loves the pool and the basketball court,'' Mr. Mancevo said. ''He never wants to move.''</p>
        <p>Looking to the future, said Mr. Michaux, Avalon's chief executive, ''we would be comfortable with capitalization of $4 billion or $5 billion by 2002. Over the five years we've been public we have created a product prototype that works, and a strong balance sheet. We feel we can export this to high-barrier-to-entry markets and downtown locations in the West. Over time we will get into New York City and Chicago, but for now we like to feel around the edges.''</p>
