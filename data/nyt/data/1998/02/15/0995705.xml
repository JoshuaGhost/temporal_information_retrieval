        <p>Bombs at Indian Political Rally  Just two days before Indians start voting, a series of bombs killed 30 people in the southern city of Coimbatore. The attack came at a rally for a Hindu nationalist leader.</p>

        <p>Sterilizations Gone Awry  Poor women in Peru have been pressed and sometimes forced to submit to sterilizations that have left two dead and hundreds injured, according to women's groups, politicians and church leaders.</p>

        <p>Hard Times for Kenya  Kenya has been faced with difficulties ranging from political upheaval to ethnic violence, shattering its economy, and now faces the difficult task of trying to regain stability.</p>

        <p>Diana Conspiracy Theories  Mohamed al-Fayed, whose son Dodi was killed along with the Princess of Wales, has endorsed the theory that the two were murdered. His remarks were denounced as malicious fantasy by Buckingham Palace.</p>

        <p>No Ski Lift on Marines' Map  A navigation map produced by the Pentagon and used by the crew of a Marine Corps jet that hit a ski lift in Italy, killing 20 people, does not show the lift, lawyers for the crew say.</p>

        <p>Judges Support Claims For Elderly Home Care  Elderly Medicare beneficiaries with severe illnesses are being improperly denied coverage for home health services that they are entitled to receive, Federal judges have ruled. Of 48,000 who contested the denial of benefits, 25,000 have won coverage, either from a review or from a Federal judge's ruling.</p>

        <p>Mysteries in the Starr Inquiry  After nearly four weeks and a flood of disclosures, the unanswered questions loom even larger -- about an alleged relationship between President Clinton and a former White House intern -- both for the inquiry led by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and for Mr. Clinton's political future.</p>
        <p>18</p>

        <p>Naming One Unknown Soldier  Sometime soon, a construction crane may lift several tons of granite, concrete and marble at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. It is quite possible the scientists will find that the man laid to rest there in 1984 was Michael J. Blassie, a highly decorated Air Force lieutenant shot down in Vietnam.</p>

        <p>The Father of Our City  Just this month alone, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has imposed a higher fine for jaywalking, lashed out at an official of the Grammy Awards and questioned the behavior of schoolchildren visiting City Hall. But the city's residents seem to welcome the sting of his paddle.</p>

        <p>Designers and Drugs  The joke going around Federal District Court in Brooklyn said the case was like ''The Birdcage'' meets ''Scarface'' -- a pair of interior decorators from San Francisco selecting fabrics and color schemes for a Colombian drug lord. But Federal prosecutors say the decorators laundered vast sums of money for the Cali cocaine cartel.</p>

        <p>Renovations on the Rise  From the Empire State Building, where tons of limestone are being stitched onto the building's skin, to the office buildings of Wall Street that are being converted into apartments, the city is quietly rebuilding its interiors and exteriors.</p>
