        <p>What do you think of a proposed state law to require that a woman wait 24 hours before getting an abortion?</p>
        <p>Informed Consent</p>
        <p>The purpose of the 24-hour waiting period would be to allow the woman to digest the new information given to her on the first encounter. She ought to have the opportunity to look at the ultrasound of her unborn child.  She ought to have information about the growing body of evidence that many women suffer long-lasting depression as they reach the expected due date or the anniversary of their abortion. To be able to rush in and make such a permanent, irreversible decision at the first encounter is not done with other types of surgery.  Why abortion?</p>
        <p>ALIETA ECK, M.D.  Piscataway</p>
        <p>Chipping Away at the Law</p>
        <p>This proposal is nothing more than a political concession to those who would chip away at the law, which grants women the right to determine their own fate.</p>
        <p>TISH PEARL  South Orange</p>
        <p>Considering Rape Victims</p>
        <p>In reading about the proposal, I see an exemption regarding medical emergency but nothing about rape victims. Who would tell a woman impregnated by sexual assault that she has to wait, just because she is otherwise healthy?</p>
        <p>K. C. JACKSON  Teaneck</p>
        <p>A Final Sentence</p>
        <p>For such an important decision, 24 hours does not seem long enough.</p>
        <p>Murder trials take much longer than 24 hours before sentencing. Why, then, does a woman get only 24 hours to decide whether an innocent victim, who may be an asset to society some day, gets a death penalty?</p>
        <p>LAURA COBRINIK  Denville</p>
        <p>Extending the Agony</p>
        <p>That's right, make us wait. Prolong the nightmare another 24 hours. The decision to get an abortion isn't painful enough, so extend the agony. And while we're at it, why not make it 48 hours? Hey, make it a full week.</p>
