        <p>IN the 1980's, photography established itself as the art form of the decade. Although photographs were a major presence on the New York art scene, there were few places in the greater Delaware Valley to see quality prints. In 1982, the Perkins Center for the Arts began to sponsor an annual exhibition devoted to the medium, and over the years, it has distinguished itself as a pre-eminent regional art show. Much of the credit for its level of professionalism and continued success goes to Hope Proper, a former photographer, who has been the chairwoman since ''Photography 3'' in 1984.</p>
        <p>With purchase prizes offered by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art in Washington and Johnson &amp; Johnson, it is not an event for local camera club amateurs, but rather a show that attracts a wide range of artist-photographers. ''Photography 17'' received one of the largest responses in the show's history. Even though all entries had to be hand-delivered here, 214 artists submitted 820 prints, coming from as far away as Rochester, N.Y., and Fairfax, Va. It is understandable that the greatest number came from New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>

        <p>IN the 1980's, photography established itself as the art form of the decade. Although photographs were a major presence on the New York art scene, there were few places in the greater Delaware Valley to see quality prints. In 1982, the Perkins Center for the Arts began to sponsor an annual exhibition devoted to the medium, and over the years, it has distinguished itself as a pre-eminent regional art show. Much of the credit for its level of professionalism and continued success goes to Hope Proper, a former photographer, who has been the chairwoman since ''Photography 3'' in 1984.</p>
        <p>With purchase prizes offered by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art in Washington and Johnson &amp; Johnson, it is not an event for local camera club amateurs, but rather a show that attracts a wide range of artist-photographers. ''Photography 17'' received one of the largest responses in the show's history. Even though all entries had to be hand-delivered here, 214 artists submitted 820 prints, coming from as far away as Rochester, N.Y., and Fairfax, Va. It is understandable that the greatest number came from New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>A juried exhibition can be only as good as the works submitted and the eye of the juror making the final selections. This year's guest juror was Tom Gitterman, director of Gallery 292 in the SoHo section of Manhattan, which specializes in both vintage 20th-century photographs and contemporary prints. Mr. Gitterman said he was ''impressed by the overall quality, not often seen in a regional show.'' He accepted for display 87 prints by 68 photographers, representing about one-third of the artists who had entered.</p>
        <p>''I chose pieces that I had strong immediate reactions to, as individual prints,'' he explained. ''There had to be a sense of depth to the work. There had to be one overriding element holding my attention, whether it was formal, conceptual or the print quality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gitterman has fashioned an exhibition that offers a solid survey of high-caliber photography. His choices represent the two major directions that have defined the medium: documentary or real images, and fabricated subjects created by the artist. An excellent sense of craft is a common thread connecting the diverse works. These well-made prints primarily honor the darkroom at a time when computer technology seems pervasive. Except for gum bichromate, all traditional processes are represented. Despite his personal taste, Mr. Gitterman did choose many toned and color prints as well as a few computer-manipulated and computer-generated images because, he said, he felt they were ''worthy of being brought to attention.''</p>
        <p>Eight photographers were selected for cash awards, and five purchase prizes went to four artists. Michael Wirtz is the only one to have both his prints chosen for purchase prizes: ''Dragon Heart'' will go to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and ''Front Yard'' to Johnson &amp; Johnson's headquarters in New Brunswick. His genre images possess an eerie cinematic quality, and the coloration of each toned photo adds to the compelling mood.</p>
        <p>''Photography 17'' presents an eclectic range of real and fictive subjects: genre scenes, urban or altered landscapes and portraits. Rounding out the show are a few nudes, scenic landscapes, still lifes and abstract images. Jeanette Tasey's cibachrome print seems at first to be an abstract design of forms and intense color. Her discreet title ''The O.R. (G-60)'' reveals that the subject is medical. Like Andres Serrano's pictures of bodily fluids, Ms. Tasey's image then emerges more clearly as an anatomical form, not just bright red shapes. The specific subject is a lens-witnessed close-up of the intestines as they are being sutured.</p>
        <p>In a more straightforward manner, Peter Doyle's ''Day Old,'' one of the three Johnson &amp; Johnson purchases, is a softly focused yet warmly toned image of a newborn. The subtle handling of the powdery whites makes the print seem like a tonalist image from the turn of the century. The baby boy's dark open mouth is a very strong compositional element that does not allow the subject to become a sentimental cliche.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Bruce Bennett creates very documentary photographs that are part of a series, which he began in 1991 to record Israel's changing identity. His ''Jerusalem No. 124'' is an exquisitely backlighted Arab mother and child. The successful representation of the lighting as seen on the stone pavement is as much a part of the subject matter as the relationship of the figures and the East Jerusalem setting.</p>
        <p>INTRIGUING pictures also result from what the artist has invented rather than directly observed. In 'Porch Light No. 2,'' Ronnie Sacco of Upper Montclair has created a poetic scene framing her daughter with English ivy and evergreens. The clarity of the child in the distance superimposed with the crisply focused foreground vegetation mysteriously defies depth of field. The lighting emanating from the young girl creates an illusion of a spirit or guardian angel that appears to be watching the viewer.</p>
        <p>J. Michael Skaggs of Bayonne has the largest prints (30 by 40 inches) in the show. ''Emasculation'' is an impressive image of time-lapse photography. As the dark, shadowy figure moves toward the first doorway, he brings to mind some of the surreal effects often used by Duane Michals. However, Mr. Skaggs is delivering a social message. The artist says the doorways, which recede into the distance, represent the centuries since the first slaves were brought to the Carolinas as well as the decades since affirmative action was first proposed. The photograph stands on its own as an enigmatic composition. Even if it is a whisper rather than a shout, the narrative enhances the interest.</p>
        <p>A century ago, Alfred Stieglitz advocated ''an Annual Photographic Salon to be run upon the strictest lines,'' adding, ''There is no better instruction than public exhibitions.'' It is the continuing commitment by the Perkins Center that makes Stieglitz's plea a reality for South Jersey. While here to select the purchases for Johnson &amp; Johnson, Michael Bzdak, manager of corporate contributions and curator of the corporate art collection, acknowledged that ''Photography 17' made an important contribution to regional art; ''New Jersey doesn't offer photographers many opportunities to exhibit their work,'' he said. This annual has become an anticipated and respected winter tradition for artist and public alike.</p>
