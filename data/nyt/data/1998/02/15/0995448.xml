        <p>Suddenly, American vocal music is all the rage in New York. Concerts and recitals this month are chock-full of works by Ned Rorem, John Harbison, Lukas Foss and a host of other American composers.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, a New York Philharmonic Ensembles concert features Mr. Rorem's ''Santa Fe Songs'' and ''Serenade on Five English Poems,'' Mr. Harbison's ''Mirabai Songs'' and Jacob Druckman's ''Dark Upon the Harp,'' at Merkin Concert Hall. And beginning on Thursday, Kurt Masur will conduct the Philharmonic in Mr. Foss's ''Time Cycle,'' with Dawn Upshaw as soprano soloist, at Avery Fisher Hall. The Philharmonic has not played the work since its premiere in 1960, led by Leonard Bernstein.</p>
        <p>Although this mini-deluge abates later in the month, another wave or two will follow in the spring. In April, the Philharmonic offers the New York premiere of Andre Previn's ''Miss Sallie Chisum Remembers Billy the Kid,'' conducted by the composer. The work is dedicated to the soprano Barbara Bonney, who will sing it and Aaron Copland's ''Eight Poems of Emily Dickinson.''</p>
        <p>What's going on here? The trend is partly the Philharmonic's doing. In the second season of its four-season project devoted to American music, the orchestra is emphasizing vocal music and short instrumental works.</p>
        <p>''We thought it was a good time to examine American music,'' said Mr. Masur, the Philharmonic's music director. ''With the end of the century upon us, it seems appropriate to look back.''</p>
        <p>Yet surely there is more to all of this than mere programming. Is it possible that American vocal music is finally coming into its own? Certainly, there are such signs. This month, London Records releases an album featuring Ms. Bonney in music by Mr. Previn, Dominick Argento, Samuel Barber and Copland. And on Teldec, the mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore sings an even more adventurous collection of American songs, with works by Jake Heggie, John Duke, Lee Hoiby, Richard Hundley, Lora Aborn and others.</p>
        <p>Ms. Upshaw, who has consistently championed American music, is not surprised. ''It's music from our home,'' she said. ''I, for one, feel a real kinship with it. I'll never be as connected to the sound or color of a word as I am in English.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bonney seconded the point. ''The best German singers are German, and the best Russian singers, Russian,'' she said. ''As a result, it's important for American singers to sing American songs.''</p>
        <p>Yet fostering a real American vocal tradition requires not only singing well-known American works like Barber's ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915'' and Copland's ''Old American Songs'' but also commissioning and performing new works, as Ms. Bonney did with the Previn piece, originally written for voice and piano, and performed in 1994.</p>
        <p>''Living in Europe, I'm not presented with as much American music as I would like,'' Ms. Bonney said. ''So I begged Andre to write a piece for me. He asked me to give him a text, and I presented him with some prose about William Bonney.'' Bonney, to whom the singer is said to be related, is better known as the outlaw Billy the Kid.</p>
        <p>''It's great to sing something tailor-made for my voice,'' Ms. Bonney said. ''Andre wrote it with my strengths in mind.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Upshaw, too, is a great believer in commissioning new music and performing unfamiliar fare. She has often sung Mr. Harbison's ''Mirabai Songs,'' which are based on Indian poems translated by Robert Bly.</p>
        <p>''I love John's music,'' she said. ''He creates a wonderful marriage of words and music that speaks clearly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harbison has featured the voice in about half of his works. He is writing his third opera, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby'' and scheduled to be performed next year at the Metropolitan Opera. His most recent work for solo voice is ''Flashes and Dedications,'' written for the baritone Sanford Sylvan and the pianist David Breitman.</p>
        <p>''The texts have to interest me in order for me to set them,'' Mr. Harbison said. He insists on setting only works he knows well, he added, ''so that they've assumed a musical shape in my head.'' And he seldom needs to look far for inspiration. ''My students say that they seek out texts,'' he said, ''but that's an experience I've never had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foss, whose ''Time Cycle'' draws on W. H. Auden, A. E. Housman, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche, is also an enthusiastic setter of texts.</p>
        <p>''More than anything, I love setting words to music,'' he said. ''Once I have a text in hand, I have ideas. You don't stare at an empty page. And besides, I like human voices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harbison shares Mr. Foss's love of voices and insists that the current generation of singers deserve much of the credit for the renewed enthusiasm for American vocal music, citing their improved pronunciation as one reason audiences have been more open to such material. Artists today sing in a manner that more approximates speaking, he said. ''Now it doesn't sound so phony when people sing.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Foss is less sanguine about the outlook for American music. In an era dominated by mass media, he suggests, the future of ''serious'' music is in doubt.</p>
        <p>''Gone are the days when we could all be misfits,'' he said. ''There is no room for a Charles Ives now.''</p>
        <p>Yet it is ultimately the responsibility of performers to bring this music to a wider public. And happily, a number of younger American singers have made a commitment to pepper their recital programs with homegrown art songs, so that audiences can now expect to hear more than the occasional Barber or Copland tune.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes people say that I'm waving a flag or on a crusade, but there's so much to love about this music,'' Ms. Upshaw said. ''I'm only doing what comes naturally.''</p>
