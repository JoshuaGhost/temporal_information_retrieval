        <p>Warning: These Olympics can cause severe disorientation, prompting such existential questions as ''When an event is delayed, and the telecast of that delay is delayed, does it all become 'live'?''</p>
        <p>Take Thursday night. TV viewers knew the men's downhill skiing had been delayed for days by winter weather (what do they expect in winter?). But there, on prime time, it was delayed again. The previous night, after endless CBS teasing, viewers finally saw Picabo Street win the super giant slalom -- a victory they'd already read about in the morning paper. So this ''delay'' in the men's downhill had to be another tease, right? No, this time it was live.</p>

        <p>Ross Rebagliati of Canada was stripped of his snowboarding gold medal for testing positive for marijuana, though the amount involved was far less than smoking a single joint. Then, after 32 hours, the forces of forgiveness provided an unscheduled event: The return of Rebagliati's medal.</p>
