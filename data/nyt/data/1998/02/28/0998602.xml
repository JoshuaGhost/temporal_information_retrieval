        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In one of your Feb. 24 letters on grade inflation, Philip M. Katz mentions the ''fear on the part of teaching fellows and junior faculty'' that ''tough grading may lead to poor evaluations, which will not help them in a shrinking academic job market.'' He concludes that only senior faculty can provide a remedy.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, tenured faculty are under comparable pressure. Course evaluations forms are now required in many institutions, and salaries are influenced by the results. When I joined the University of Michigan 30 years ago, my salary was higher than that of any member of the anthropology department who is still active today. My standards for grading have not followed the trend toward inflation. Student complaints about grades have increased, and now my salary is at the bottom of the professorial list.</p>
