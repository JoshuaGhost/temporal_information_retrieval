        <p>With a jury selected, opening arguments were scheduled for Monday in the trial of Austin Offen, who is charged with the near-fatal beating of a Long Island man with a steel bar nearly two years ago while an off-duty New York City policeman allegedly held the victim's friends at bay with a gun.</p>
        <p>Although the victim, Shane Daniels, 22, of Riverhead, does not recall the attack because of severe injuries to his skull, he is on the prosecution's list of prospective witnesses and is not expected to be in the courtroom during opening proceedings.</p>
        <p>Judge Joel L. Lefkowitz of Suffolk County Criminal Court, in several last-minute rulings, denied defense motions to exclude two witnesses to the attack on Mr. Daniels on May 26, 1996, outside a Southampton nightclub. The judge also ruled that the prosecution may raise the issue of Mr. Offen's prior criminal record, including two assaults, should the defendant, a 27-year-old from Floral Park, Queens, decide to take the witness stand in his own defense.</p>
        <p>A co-defendant in the case, Constantine Chronis, 36, of Hicksville, who resigned from the New York City Police Department following the charges that he participated in the attack, is to be tried separately on charges including assault and official misconduct.</p>
