        <p>And the winners are Narciso Rodriguez and Sandy Dalal.</p>
        <p>For the first time in the 17 years that the Council of Fashion Designers of America has held award ceremonies, there was some surprise at Sunday night's event. Winners of the Perry Ellis Award for new talent were announced on stage, with Mr. Rodriguez named for women's wear and Mr. Dalal for men's wear.</p>
        <p>But the real excitement was provided by John Galliano, winner of the International Award, and Elizabeth Taylor, who was recognized for a lifetime of glamour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galliano brought his spring haute couture collection for Christian Dior from Paris to the banquet hall at 55 Wall Street and supplied what the award ceremony has lacked in recent years: fashion. Other winners vie to present the cleverest, most esoteric video, which rarely includes their designs. Mr. Galliano -- a vision in marcelled hair and a single dangling earring -- scored a coup and thrilled the 1,000 dinner guests by showing the fabulous clothes many of them had read about but not seen in person.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taylor received a standing ovation for being the personification of a quality these award evenings strive for and rarely attain: true glamour. Demi Moore, who presented the award wearing black pants and a sparkle-trimmed sweater set, praised Ms. Taylor's ''tireless efforts to fight against AIDS long before it was fashionable.''</p>
        <p>With a silver-beaded white dress setting off her pure white hair, Ms. Taylor charmed the audience by saying, ''I've been on every worst list ever compiled, so eat your heart out, Mr. Blackwell.''</p>
        <p>The women in attendance certainly made an effort to be fashionable, whether in short beaded dresses or long slinky numbers. Elizabeth Hurley, arriving with Hugh Grant and Liz Tilberis, combined both beads and slinkiness in a long, flesh-tone Versace dress. Ms. Tilberis was more discreet in a simple black dress with a single jewel. Sigourney Weaver wore a beaded black slip dress, and Libby Pataki, the wife of Gov. George E. Pataki, was swathed in a feather-trimmed black shawl.</p>
        <p>Many of the younger men eschewed traditional black tie. Rupert Everett and Matt Le Blanc simply left their white shirt collars unbuttoned. John Bartlett, who was named men's wear designer of the year, sported a ribbed white turtleneck under a white suit. Marc Jacobs, the women's wear designer of the year, wore a black pullover sweater, Mr. Rodriguez a navy pullover. Mr. Dalal had his iridescent taffeta shirt hanging outside his trousers.</p>
        <p>At the evening's start, the arriving guests were met by animal-rights demonstrators pouring red paint on themselves and being dragged away by the police and security guards. No one's fur coat was splattered, so it was on with the show.</p>
        <p>First came free-flowing Champagne supplied by Dom Perignon (which underwrote the evening) in the lobby of the J. P. Morgan Building, at 60 Wall Street. Then guests crossed the tent-enclosed street to No. 55, a 19th-century building that has been the Mercantile Exchange, the Custom House and a Citibank and will be the Cipriani Hotel in the near future. There, in the monumentally proportioned banquet hall, a stage had been erected facing round tables haloed in candlelight.</p>
        <p>After dinner, catered by Cipriani, came the show. The host, Christine Baranski, who plays a fashion victim on the television show ''Cybil,'' was a bit of a real-life fashion victim, changing her dress four times.</p>
        <p>Ralph Lauren stood for traditional male fashion by wearing a formal double-breasted black suit to accept the Dom Perignon Award for Humanitarian Leadership, and Geoffrey Beene wore his usual black velvet jacket over a white shirt buttoned at the neck to receive his Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
        <p>Manolo Blahnik's special Stiletto Award was presented by Kate Moss in long black sequins and Naomi Campbell in glittering gold.</p>
        <p>The evening stood out from the council's previous awards events by its site and format and, more significant, with a welcome new emphasis on the designers who represent fashion's future.</p>
