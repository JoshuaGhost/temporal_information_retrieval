        <p>In an effort to halt expansion at the Westchester County Airport, County Executive Andrew J. Spano has rescinded a plan by his predecessor to build a 900-square-foot lounge for business travelers at a cost of $413,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano called the project by former Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke ''stealth expansion,'' and said the executive lounge was not needed at the small airport.</p>

        <p>Mr. Spano called the project by former Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke ''stealth expansion,'' and said the executive lounge was not needed at the small airport.</p>
        <p>The Westchester County Airport is ''not an exchange airport,'' said Mr. Spano, ''where people fly in and wait for another flight to fly out. My opinion is that there are very few weary business travelers who use Westchester County.''</p>
        <p>Many residents were opposed to any expansion of the airport, fearing more traffic on the ground and in the air.</p>
