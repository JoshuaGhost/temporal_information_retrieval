        <p>PHINEHAS Chaplin feinted to his right and drove left, half a step ahead of Aaron Harvey, which was all the lead he needed for the bucket. Then it was Aaron's turn, and he reached over Phinehas to score with a soft jump shot.</p>
        <p>They went at it for 45 minutes, trading baskets in an earnest game of one on one at the Holcombe Rucker Memorial Playground, a shrine to hoop dreams on West 155th Street, across from the Polo Ground Houses. Never mind that Phinehas is 14 and Aaron only 12, already 6 feet tall. When it comes to working on a dream, you're never too young.</p>

        <p>They went at it for 45 minutes, trading baskets in an earnest game of one on one at the Holcombe Rucker Memorial Playground, a shrine to hoop dreams on West 155th Street, across from the Polo Ground Houses. Never mind that Phinehas is 14 and Aaron only 12, already 6 feet tall. When it comes to working on a dream, you're never too young.</p>
        <p>''Every day I have a chance to, I come out and play,'' Phinehas said. ''Same with him,'' he added, pointing to his friend. ''I don't care if it's raining. Even in the rain, I'm out here. All I want is to play in the N.B.A.''</p>
        <p>He and maybe half a million other youngsters in this city.</p>
        <p>New York went hoop nuts on the weekend, when the National Basketball Association held its All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden for the first time in 30 years. Everywhere you turned, there was one basketball event or another, a tangle of hope, hype and hucksterism that fattened the local treasury with millions in sales tax revenue (which, by municipal definition, means that the extravaganzas were good, no matter how overdone).</p>
        <p>But young New Yorkers like Phinehas and Aaron don't need the artificial stimulant of an All-Star Game to get the basketball juices flowing. For them, the playground is a daily reminder that a good shooting eye, compression-spring legs and a lucky break or two can be their ticket out of the projects.</p>
        <p>Stephone Bryant, 19, is convinced that he's as ready for the pros as the latest N.B.A. hotshot, who happens to share the same age and last name: Kobe Bryant. He may not be as physically imposing as his namesake, Stephone Bryant acknowledged. ''My hands are small,'' he said. ''But they can do amazing things.''</p>
        <p>Amazing or not, he knows one thing. That if he ever got the opportunity to play pro ball, he would not blow it the way Latrell Sprewell recently did.</p>
        <p>Unless you read the sports pages, you may not be familiar with Mr. Sprewell, but he is the central figure in a morality tale unfolding in New York, where the N.B.A. has its offices. His violent behavior has raised many questions, perhaps the most important being whether we will finally demand that overpaid, over-pampered professional athletes abide by the same rules as the rest of us.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sprewell, an excitable fellow, had a $32 million contract with the lowly Golden State Warriors. Two months ago, he choked, punched and threatened to kill his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, after Mr. Carlesimo had screamed at him once too often.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlesimo, by all accounts, can be verbally abusive. But most people know that in this life, except maybe for the Fantasyland of sports, you do not punch the boss just because he is a creep. And if you do, be prepared for stiff consequences.</p>
        <p>Faced repeatedly with outrageous conduct by players who have not heard the word ''no'' since the age of 11, the N.B.A. decided to put its collective foot down. The Warriors terminated Mr. Sprewell's contract, which had $24 million remaining, and the league suspended him for a year.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the National Basketball Players Association yelled foul. Whenever an athlete is disciplined these days for conduct unbecoming -- for spitting in an umpire's face, for kicking a defenseless cameraman, for taking drugs -- you can count on his union's protesting that the penalty is excessive. True to form, Mr. Sprewell, with the players association behind him, is asking for relief from a New York arbitrator, John D. Feerick, the dean of Fordham's law school.</p>
        <p>WHATEVER Mr. Feerick decides, the verdict is already in on the court of the Rucker playground. It may not be to Mr. Sprewell's liking. A few players, like Luke Gayle, 15, said that a shorter suspension would have been fair. But most agreed with Aaron Harvey that ''Sprewell's wrong, dead wrong'' and with Phinehas Chaplin that ''you ought to listen to what the coach tells you to do.''</p>
        <p>Stephone Bryant had trouble believing that any ballplayer could just toss away a mega-dollar career. And he had little sympathy as well, he said, for Anthony Mason, the ex-Knick charged over the weekend with statutory rape in Queens.</p>
        <p>''I know there are other things in life besides basketball,'' he said while watching a one-on-one game. ''But I love it. I'd give my last dollar to play in the N.B.A.''</p>
