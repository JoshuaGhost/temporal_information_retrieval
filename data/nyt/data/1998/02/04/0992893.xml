        <p>A high intake of two B vitamins found in fruits, vegetables and other common foods appears to reduce by nearly half women's risk of heart attacks, a study has shown. The study also confirmed a protective effect on women's hearts of drinking moderate amounts of alcohol.</p>
        <p>The study, conducted among more than 80,000 women who are nurses, is the first to show a direct link between these B vitamins, folate and B-6, and protection against coronary disease. It suggests that eating more fruits, vegetables and whole grains or getting these B vitamins from supplements is as important as quitting smoking, lowering cholesterol and controlling blood pressure in preventing premature death from the nation's leading killer.</p>
