        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Starr's Squad of Prosecutors Knows Meaning of Hardball'' (front page, Feb. 2) quotes Joseph E. diGenova, a former special prosecutor and former United States Attorney, as defending the tactics of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel. Mr. diGenova says ''these are the tactics and strategies that are used by the Justice Department every day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. diGenova is correct: every day Federal prosecutors induce people to surreptitiously tape-record conversations with their friends, promise immunity or great leniency to people who will testify in accordance with the prosecutor's wishes, and threaten prosecution to those who have not committed crimes or who have minor involvement in criminality. Rather than criticize Mr. Starr, perhaps we should consider whether the tactics commonly used by Federal and local law enforcement authorities should be curtailed.</p>
