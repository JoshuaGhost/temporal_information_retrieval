        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator Jesse Helms's announcement that he endorses a plan to permit more humanitarian aid to the Cuban people, including United States Government assistance, should not be mistaken as a shift in his hard-line position on the Cuban embargo (news article, Jan. 30).</p>
        <p>The level of aid allowed by the United States to trickle to Cuba from private groups in the United States pales in comparison to that country's import needs. According to Treasury Department figures, the value of private American aid licensed for export to Cuba between 1992 and 1995 was $63 million. Yet in 1990 alone, before a 1992 law banned foreign subsidiaries of United States companies from trading with Cuba, Cuba imported $400 million in food and medicines from these companies. This figure represents 90 percent of the banned trade.</p>

        <p>The health of Cubans cannot be sustained by private charity. Legislation that is pending in Congress would allow commercial trade in food and medicine. This is the only humane response to the distress our embargo has caused the Cuban people.</p>
