        <p>In a victory for residents who have long been irritated by helicopter noise, a Federal appellate court has allowed New York City to restrict the operations of its East 34th Street Heliport in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The decision Tuesday means that the city can phase out weekend flights and demand a reduction in the number of flights from the heliport. It also means that the heliport must scale back its hours, operating from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. on weekdays and from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. on weekends, instead of from 7 A.M. to 11 P.M. on all days.</p>

        <p>In a victory for residents who have long been irritated by helicopter noise, a Federal appellate court has allowed New York City to restrict the operations of its East 34th Street Heliport in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The decision Tuesday means that the city can phase out weekend flights and demand a reduction in the number of flights from the heliport. It also means that the heliport must scale back its hours, operating from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. on weekdays and from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. on weekends, instead of from 7 A.M. to 11 P.M. on all days.</p>
        <p>In a way, the decision is moot, because the city's adversary in the lawsuit, National Helicopter, was evicted from the heliport in August for failing to pay the rent. The current tenant at the heliport, Johnson Controls, runs a much lighter schedule than National, also known as Island Helicopter, did.</p>
        <p>But the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit suggests that the city has the upper hand on noise, pollution and regulation for any of the three other major heliports.</p>
        <p>''It sends a message that we do actually have the right to place reasonable restrictions on heliports,'' said City Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, who represents the area near the heliport.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for National Helicopter did not return calls last night. No one answered the phone at a location in Farmingdale, Long Island, that was believed to be the most recent site of National Helicopter's headquarters.</p>
        <p>The decision was the latest installment of a long-running battle between the city and National Helicopter, which had operated flights out of the 34th Street Heliport since 1973.</p>
        <p>Residents had complained more about the noise, and the frequency, of the helicopter flights. In 1995, there were 53,973 takeoffs and landings, 11.7 percent more than in 1994..</p>
        <p>In 1995, the city applied for a new permit for the continued operation of the heliport, and it tried to reduce the number of takeoffs and landings to 28,000 a year, or 77 a day.</p>
        <p>National Helicopter sued the city, saying that the limits might force it into bankruptcy. In January 1997, Federal District Judge Sonia Sotomayor ruled in favor of National, saying that the city had not provided sufficient evidence to justify such a high level of regulation and that the Federal Aviation Administration had the final word over air traffic.</p>
