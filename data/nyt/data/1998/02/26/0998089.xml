        <p>James R Oestreich reviews recital by Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky at Carnegie Hall; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the first half of his recital on Tuesday evening at Carnegie Hall, a wide-ranging assortment of Baroque and Classical songs and arias, the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky offered greater satisfaction than many another singer can muster in an entire evening. Then he proceeded to put it all in the shade, with a second half consisting of ''Petersburg,'' a stunningly powerful ''vocal poem'' by Georgi Sviridov.</p>
        <p>Vocal fans may know Sviridov, who died last month at 82, from an earlier song cycle performed by Mr. Hvorostovsky and his pianist here, Mikhail Arkadiyev, ''Russia Cast Adrift'' (recorded by Philips). Sviridov spent two decades on ''Petersburg,'' a cycle of nine songs set to poems by Alexandr Blok, and completed it in 1995 especially for Mr. Hvorostovsky and Mr. Arkadiyev.</p>

        <p>In the first half of his recital on Tuesday evening at Carnegie Hall, a wide-ranging assortment of Baroque and Classical songs and arias, the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky offered greater satisfaction than many another singer can muster in an entire evening. Then he proceeded to put it all in the shade, with a second half consisting of ''Petersburg,'' a stunningly powerful ''vocal poem'' by Georgi Sviridov.</p>
        <p>Vocal fans may know Sviridov, who died last month at 82, from an earlier song cycle performed by Mr. Hvorostovsky and his pianist here, Mikhail Arkadiyev, ''Russia Cast Adrift'' (recorded by Philips). Sviridov spent two decades on ''Petersburg,'' a cycle of nine songs set to poems by Alexandr Blok, and completed it in 1995 especially for Mr. Hvorostovsky and Mr. Arkadiyev.</p>
        <p>The match of sensibilities is astonishing, from Blok's vivid and harrowing poetry through Sviridov's somber yet remarkably subtle and varied melodies and harmonies to the performers, who seemed here to be living out the texts. Mr. Hvorostovsky was nothing less than a biblically scaled prophet, intoning ''A Voice From the Chorus'': ''O my friends, if you only knew the cold and darkness of the days coming!''</p>
        <p>Sviridov's piquant, often piercing, dissonances seemed everywhere apt, as text, music and performance continued to haunt in ''Those Born in Obscure Years'': ''We, the children of Russia's dreadful years, can forget nothing.'' The bleakness was relieved but little in the final song, ''The Virgin in the City,'' yet that little seemed ineffably comforting after the dread journey that had come before.</p>
        <p>In the rest of the program, Mr. Hvorostovsky conveyed sorrow and romance ideally, with a rich, dark voice seemingly tailor made for either. The familiar ''Ombra mai fu,'' from Handel's ''Xerxes,'' may never have been heard to better effect.</p>
        <p>Joy seems a more problematic issue for Mr. Hvorostovsky, at least as expressed in Baroque terms. The florid ornamentation of ''Sorge infausta una procella,'' from Handel's ''Orlando,'' defeated him, not because of its difficulty but because of the very fullness of his lower-middle register; the pitches and rhythms, though seemingly in place, failed to sort themselves out even in Carnegie's fine acoustics. Of intense joy, only the intensity came through.</p>
        <p>The Champagne Aria from Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' too, seemed an exercise in moving a big voice around quickly rather than an attempt to put across a sparkling text. But two other numbers by Mozart were mightily effective, as were two by Gluck. (So Gluck's Orfeo wasn't a wimp after all.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Arkadiev proved an exemplary collaborator. He seemed at first too deferential in the earliest numbers, by Caccini and Cesti, but his little, flowering lutelike excrescences around the voice put in relief his skill at laying down just the right carpet of sound for the early Baroque. He took a stronger part later, as appropriate, and became a full and potent partner in the Sviridov.</p>
