        <p>BY any measure, Lisa Van Dusen's life is a hectic one. Her job as marketing director of a twice-weekly newspaper in Palo Alto, Calif., rivals the demands of being mother to two young sons, volunteering at their school and staying active in her community. For the past 15 years, Ms. Van Dusen, 43, has carried at her side through busy days a leather binder crammed with schedules, a calculator, paper clips and work rosters. Now she is grappling with a thoroughly modern dilemma: whether to replace this three-pound notebook with an electronic organizer that would be not much larger than an audio cassette but could hold 10 times as much information.</p>
        <p>The compulsion to impose order on frazzled lives, coupled with technology's capaciousness, has made electronic organizers a much-loved accessory in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>The most ardent devotees are rarely separated from their pocket organizers. They use them for everything from schedules to pocket chess and spiff them up like hot rods. Adornments range from customized paint jobs to blinking lights that serve as silent alarms. But whether this gadget is a tool or a toy -- a help or a distraction -- is open to debate.</p>
        <p>Ever since Frederick W. Taylor first put a stopwatch to a machinist in the 19th century, time management has been a national preoccupation. Among white-collar workers in the late 1990's, that means striving for the efficient use of hours filled with meetings, phone calls, lunches, travel and household logistics. Filofax popularized the planning diary in the early 1980's, and the books are now carried by some 30 million Americans.</p>
        <p>Electronic organizers have been around since the 1980's, when products like the Sharp Wizard, a handheld device with calendar and phone-book functions, came on the market. But the Wizard and similar devices had so many limits they often ended up in the back of a desk drawer. That changed two years ago when Palm Computing, a Silicon Valley start-up, introduced the five-ounce, $299 Palm Pilot. Not only was the Palm Pilot tiny and lightweight, but its ability to share data with a desktop computer and synchronize information quickly on both machines caused sales to take off so fast that it made the Sony Walkman look like a sleeper. Within 18 months, Palm Computing, now a subsidiary of the 3Com Corporation, had sold a million units, and a handful of lookalikes were being hurried to the market. Palm Computing says it expects to sell an additional one million Palm Pilots by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Part of the lure of electronic organizers is their promise to sort out, as never before, the diverse details that go into planning one's day. Not only is their storage capacity vast, but electronic organizers -- ranging in price from $129 to $799 -- are also versatile. They can act as alarm clock, pager, calculator, note pad, expense log, game board, E-mail retrieval system and Web browser. Some models are beginning to include voice recorders.</p>
        <p>The Palm Pilot's most avid users are self-confessed gadget freaks who spend hours -- the time they presumably save by using an electronic organizer -- loading their devices with digital paraphernalia. They are willing to adjust to the lack of a keyboard. The Pilot's screen is sensitive to touch, and phone numbers and contacts are written in with a stylus, using a stylized form of handwriting or tapping on letters on the small screen.</p>
        <p>One user, Eric Benson, a programmer at the on-line book seller Amazon.com, keeps close to his chest recipes for a Rusty Nail and a few hundred other cocktails. He can always punch up, in its entirety, Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'' or any of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets. If the urge strikes, he can tap out a tune on his palm-size synthesizer or look up the phase of the moon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benson has not actually read ''Heart of Darkness'' on his Palm Pilot's tiny screen, and he has only an occasional need for a cocktail recipe. Once in a while, he calls up a sonnet. ''You can read one while waiting for the bus and ask yourself, 'I wonder what he meant by that?' '' he said. Still, he conceded, he uses the Palm Pilot primarily for looking up phone numbers, addresses and his various access codes and passwords.</p>
        <p>Despite the growing popularity of electronic organizers, they are not for everyone. In fact, their faddishness has given rise to a friendly debate between the paper die-hards and the digital converts. Those in the latter group -- compulsive synchronizers -- argue that duplicating the data on a desktop computer safeguards against disaster.</p>
        <p>Andrea Grossman, president of Mrs. Grossman's Paper Company, a sticker business in Petaluma, Calif., counts herself among the Luddites. She has spent years refining her Filofax, which contains foldout maps, family photos, a pocket where she always keeps a $20 bill, a page devoted to Psalm 91 and at least one note card ''all stickered up and ready to go.'' Mrs. Grossman color-codes each section. Her method, she insisted, is highly efficient. She is so convinced of this that she regularly challenges a friend, a dedicated user of an electronic organizer, to a race to see who can find a piece of information first. ''I always win,'' Mrs. Grossman said.</p>
        <p>The friend in question, Dee Gruenig, a designer of rubber stamps in Irvine, Calif., switched to a Sharp organizer six years ago and has not looked back. She trades up as each new model comes out. Ms. Gruenig teaches courses around the world in the craft of rubber stamping, and she is seldom without her organizer.</p>
        <p>On a recent trip to South Korea to teach rubber-stamping techniques to United States Army arts and crafts directors, Ms. Gruenig showed off her organizer to ''three civilians and a general,'' all of whom, she said, were impressed. ''I should get a royalty,'' she said. Ms. Gruenig said her friend Mrs. Grossman was the only nut she had yet to crack. And the race? Ms. Gruenig explained that she was at a disadvantage because she had to turn on her device. ''She gets a head start,'' Ms. Gruenig said.</p>
        <p>MANY people's ambivalence toward electronic organizers has a great deal to do with habits and how they like to see information presented. Retrieving a schedule from a Palm Pilot requires tapping a series of icons. By contrast, Mrs. Grossman's Filofax contains a foldout calendar that lets her see an entire year at once. Like Mrs. Grossman's book, Ms. Van Dusen's is filled with her own distinctive handwritten entries. ''I'm a visual person, and I process things by writing, which is what I can't get past with the electronic one,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even some of the most proficient techies are not sure about electronic organizers.</p>
        <p>A circle of Silicon Valley executives -- some of them venture capitalists who have helped finance the makers of electronic organizers -- relies on narrow white spiral notebooks for notes and lists. The practice began with Vinod Khosla, a partner in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers in Menlo Park, Calif., when he found the notebooks at a local art supply store. He and others became so reliant on the books for taking notes and making lists that when the store stopped carrying them, the executives started having a local printer produce custom-made notebooks.</p>
        <p>Shabbir Safdar, a 30-year-old political strategist, has been playing with electronic games and gadgets since he was old enough to reach an electrical outlet. Mr. Safdar was an avid user of Apple Computer's Newton Message Pad until last Christmas, when he received a paper-based organizer. Now he prefers the more tactile system. Instead of clicking for phone numbers, he gives his Rolodex a gratifying spin. For his to-do items, he employs a system that he insists is foolproof: he writes everything on Post-it notes and stuffs them in his shirt pocket for easy access throughout the day. At night, he takes out the remaining notes. ''That's how I know what I forgot to do,'' he said. Those notes go into the next day's shirt pocket.</p>
        <p>Those who swear by their Day-Timers and Filofaxes offer another argument against electronic scheduling. Giving your life over to an electronic organizer, they point out, erases yet a set of personal footprints. Day planners like Ms. Van Dusen's serve as a scrapbook of quotidian life. They are a palimpsest, a testament to lives constantly rewritten. Being able to count the number of times a close friend has moved or chancing upon an old scrap of paper scribbled with directions can be hard to give up.</p>
        <p>Partly for that reason, Tim Mott, a computer-industry veteran who runs a venture capital firm, stands by his paper-based method. He has saved every calendar since 1970. ''Sometimes just the way the ink is on the paper gives me a lot of visual cues that help me remember something,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, the paper and digital systems are co-existing like cats and dogs under the same roof.</p>
        <p>Sally Rosenthal, a Silicon Valley consultant, has applied near-scientific rigor in 15 years of searching for the perfect planning method. Ms. Rosenthal has gone from a  spiral-bound organizer to a miniature five-ring binder -- precisely the size of the Palm Pilot. Her setup is now so small that she also carries a tiny magnifying glass.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, six months ago Ms. Rosenthal began using a PalmPilot because it offers two things her paper planner does not: Web browsing and E-mail. Now she uses both systems.</p>
        <p>Has she attained organizational nirvana? ''No!'' she said. ''I had pared everything down to this one paper book. Now I have to carry two things.''</p>
        <p>Many other people also opt for combinations, using a paper planner for some things and its electronic counterpart for others. Most makers of paper-based planners sell software counterparts. Information resides in a computer but can be printed and snapped into a binder. Franklin Covey, maker of the Franklin Planner, a complex but popular organizer, sells the Palm Pilot loaded with its scheduling software. Franklin Covey also makes leather binders with a special sleeve for the Palm Pilot.</p>
        <p>Market prospects for electronic organizers are strong. Mobile Insights, a market research company in Mountain View, Calif., predicts that sales of such organizers will double in 1998 and continue to grow rapidly over the next several years. Now the Palm Pilot faces competition from the Microsoft Corporation's new software, named Palm PC. Announced last month, Palm PC is a still slimmer version of Microsoft's CE operating system, which in turn is an abbreviated version of Windows 95. In June, Philips Electronics and a half-dozen other hardware makers plan to start selling devices based on the new Microsoft software.</p>
        <p>WHAT does this mean for the paper-based planners? ''They're dead,'' declared Gerry Purdy, chief executive of Mobile Insights. ''In five years, if you're using a paper-based planner, you'll be laughed at.''</p>
        <p>Others disagree. Paper shows few signs of disappearing any time soon. Some $800 million worth of paper-based planners were sold in 1997, and the market continues to grow at about 5 percent a year, according to numbers compiled by Day-Timers.</p>
        <p>For some, the existence of both methods feeds obsession. Michael Thomas, a 26-year-old PC specialist at the Burns Clinic in Petoskey, Mich., bought a Palm Pilot last August, and he loves it. He finds that it takes him half the time to do with his Palm Pilot what he used to do with his Franklin Planner. Last month, he bought a Newton Message Pad, too, to hold medical records.</p>
        <p>When he gets home each night, he uses some of the time he saves to enter what he did that day into his Franklin Planner. ''I still like to see my handwriting,'' he said. Of course, come July 1, when the current batch of calendar pages runs out, he said, he will give up the paper system entirely. But in the meantime, a hard-copy archive can't hurt.</p>
