        <p>The chairman of the New York City Campaign Finance Board called yesterday for drastic changes in the city's campaign finance rules, including stricter limits on contributions, a ban on donations from corporations and most organizations, and new rules to encourage small donors.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, the chairman of the finance board, an independent municipal agency, presented the board's recommendations before a City Council committee that is considering another package of campaign reform measures sponsored by the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and the city's Public Advocate, Mark Green.</p>
        <p>The bill offered by Mr. Vallone and Mr. Green would effectively prohibit campaign contributions by corporations. But the campaign board's proposals are much broader.</p>
        <p>Under Father O'Hare's proposals, citywide candidates who get public matching funds would be allowed to accept no more than $5,000 from each contributor, down from the $8,500 limit now in place for the 2001 election cycle.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the current contribution guidelines, Father O'Hare said,  ''Limits this high raise the question of whether the law will meet its central objective,'' which he said was ''to reduce the risk and appearance that large campaign contributions buy undue influence.''</p>
        <p>For candidates running for borough president, the limit would be reduced to $5,000, from $6,500. Candidates seeking City Council seats would face a limit of $2,000 per contribution, compared with the current $3,900.</p>
        <p>The board also proposed prohibiting candidates from accepting contributions from not only corporations but also unions and other organizations. The exception, Father O'Hare said, would be political committees that register with the Campaign Finance Board. Those political committees would be required to file disclosure statements with the board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone, the Council Speaker, said that Father O'Hare's recommendations would be given serious consideration and that he was open to modifying his bill with some of the Campaign Finance Board's suggestions. But he added that many others have made recommendations and that the Council would study all the proposals. ''We have the time to deliberate and we want to do as much reform as possible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration has said that the Vallone-Green proposals does not go far enough, but mayoral aides did not immediately comment yesterday on Father O'Hare's recommendations.</p>
        <p>While several organizations offered proposals at yesterday's hearing, the recommendations of Father O'Hare are widely considered to carry more weight with both the Council and the Giuliani administration. Father O'Hare, the president of Fordham University and chairman of the five-member campaign board, has been well regarded by many advocacy groups who have hailed his stewardship as nonpartisan.</p>
        <p>The board administers the city's voluntary campaign finance program. Under the program, candidates can get public financing in exchange for limiting their contributions from private donors and their spending, and abiding by financial reporting rules.</p>
        <p>The board tangled with the campaign organization of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during last year's campaign, saying hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to Mr. Giuliani had violated the city rules and temporarily cutting off public funds to the campaign. The Mayor's campaign raised questions about the board's interpretation of the rules but eventually returned the donations and was reinstated in the public financing program.</p>
        <p>In the 1993 campaign, Father O'Hare skirmished with Mayor David N. Dinkins, forcing his campaign to pay more than $200,000 for advertisements that were produced by the Democratic Party. Mr. Dinkins had replaced Father O'Hare in the final working day of his term in office, angering the incoming mayor. Mr. Giuliani reappointed Father O'Hare soon after taking office.</p>
        <p>Under the current campaign rules, the city matches contributions to a maximum of $1,000 from city residents. If the participating candidate is running against someone not participating in the program, the city lifts the spending caps and doubles its contributions.</p>
        <p>Under the new recommendations from the campaign board, the city would match, on a 3-to-1 basis, contributions up to $250. Father O'Hare said the changes would encourage more city residents to contribute to political campaigns and increase the value of those contributions.</p>
        <p>The board was not alone yesterday in calling for additional reforms. Several organizations testified yesterday that the Council's proposal was not enough.</p>
        <p>''A ban on corporate contributions will do little by itself to reduce the grip of special interests on city politics,'' said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>In his testimony, he also called for lower contribution limits, stricter guidelines on who could contribute and an election-year ban on government-paid ads featuring elected officials who are candidates for office.</p>
        <p>''Indeed, the corporate ban alone could have intended negative effects, such as driving corporate contributions underground,'' he said.</p>
