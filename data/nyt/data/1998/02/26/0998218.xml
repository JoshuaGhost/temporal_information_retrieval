        <p>Construction of Route 92, a proposed 6.7-mile link between Route 1 and the turnpike at Jamesburg intended to relieve north-south traffic congestion, has been delayed for 60 years by complications ranging from demographic shifts to budget constraints.</p>

        <p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority yesterday rejected a proposal by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to change the proposed path of Route 92, asserting that its own plan is better for both commuters and the environment.</p>
        <p>Construction of Route 92, a proposed 6.7-mile link between Route 1 and the turnpike at Jamesburg intended to relieve north-south traffic congestion, has been delayed for 60 years by complications ranging from demographic shifts to budget constraints.</p>
        <p>In October, the Federal agency, which must decide whether to approve the $300 million project, said the current proposal would damage wetlands, and it recommended a route several miles to the south.</p>
        <p>In response, the Turnpike Authority issued a report yesterday criticizing the Federal agency's plan for failing to sufficiently reduce traffic on Route 1, and for disturbing agricultural and park land and 79 current or proposed residences.</p>
        <p>Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the environmental agency, said it would review the Turnpike Authority's report and decide on the project within the next few months.</p>
