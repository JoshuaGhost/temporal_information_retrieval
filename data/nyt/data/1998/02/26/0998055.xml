        <p>YOUNGMAN-Henny. The Officers, Governors and Members of the New York Friars Club deeply mourn the loss of their beloved Friar and Friend, Henny Youngman. Henny brought the gift of laughter into the Friars Monastery daily through his quips, one-liners and unique take on the world around him. We are honored and proud to have played such a large part in the larger-than-life world of this endearing comic. He was an entertainer who made a nation laugh and today we take pause, in our sadness, to laugh at the memory of hearing those infamous words, ''Take my wife, please.'' Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Jack L. Green, Dean Emeritus Jean Pierre Trebot, Executive Director</p>
        <p>YOUNGMAN-Henny. Congregation Ezrath Israel, The Actors Temple, mourns the loss of a very dear friend and congregant of many years. We will miss him. Robert Goldman, President Noach Valley, Rabbi</p>
        <p>YOUNGMAN-Henny. Dear Henny, I will always cherish the ''Dime-On-Pin'' you gave me and the way you always said ''Hello Darling!'' All my love, Your Friar Friend, Laura Slutsky</p>
        <p>YOUNGMAN-Henny. I will miss you, my dear, and never forget you. Love, Paula</p>
        <p>YOUNGMAN-Henny. Without you an egg cream will just be seltzer. Lovingly, Joy Golden</p>
