        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your Feb. 19 front-page article on a mail campaign by law school deans against U.S. News and World Report's law-school rankings, we learn the following:</p>
        <p>The Law School Admission Council (the people who write and administer the Law School Admission Test) financed the $50,000 mailing; the deans claim that the rankings place too much weight on the admission test, causing a ''pernicious effect'' that causes the law schools to be ''more inclined to look at a candidate's test score and play down other factors'' in admissions.</p>
        <p>So have these law school deans been compromising their admissions processes emphasizing higher test scores because they were more worried about a popularity contest than the fairest evaluation of candidates? Does anyone believe these deans?</p>
        <p>Law schools have been overemphasizing the Law School Admission Test in the admission process since long before U.S. News began its ranking.</p>
        <p>DAVID A. HOLLANDER  New York, Feb. 19, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is co-author of The Princeton Review's Best Law Schools (1998).</p>
