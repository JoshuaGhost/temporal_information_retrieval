        <p>Three people were treated for trauma yesterday after a man jumped to his death from the 17th floor of a midtown Manhattan building as they were leaving a subway station, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man jumped from the McAlpin House at 50 West 34th Street on the corner of the Avenue of the Americas at 8:30 A.M.. Eyewitnesses said one of the three people who saw the suicide, a 10-year-old boy, was struck by the man's leg, which had detached from his body following the initial impact from the fall.</p>
        <p>That boy, his 7-year-old brother and their 34-year-old mother were all taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where they were treated for trauma and received counseling before they were released, said Lorinda Klein, a Bellevue spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The man, Joel Levine, 42, an accountant who had an office in the building, also crashed through a newsstand on the sidewalk.</p>
