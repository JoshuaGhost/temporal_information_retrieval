        <p>A jury  began deliberations today in the trial of a 20-year-old former Naval Academy midshipman charged with kidnapping and murdering a high school girl who had had sex with the midshipman's boyfriend.</p>
        <p>The midshipman, Diane Zamora,  faces a mandatory life sentence, with the possibility of parole after 40 years, if convicted on the capital murder count.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zamora was charged along with her boyfriend, David C. Graham, also 20 and a former Air Force Academy cadet, in the Dec. 4, 1995, slaying of 16-year-old Adrianne Jones. Mr. Graham is expected to go to trial here later, but no date has been set.</p>
        <p>The case went to the jury shortly before 11 A.M., and deliberations continued until 6:25 P.M., when jurors were excused and sequestered for the night.</p>
        <p>Evidence in the two-week trial included written confessions by both Ms. Zamora and Mr. Graham. In them, the pair told of kidnapping Ms. Jones and driving her to a field in Grand Prairie, a Dallas suburb,  where Ms. Zamora smashed the girl in the head with a dumbbell before Mr. Graham shot her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham told the police that he had shot the girl he had had one sexual encounter with in order to satisfy Ms. Zamora's ''womanly vengeance.'' Ms. Zamora, in her confession, said that on the night of the murder she screamed to Mr. Graham, ''Kill her! Kill her!''</p>
        <p>But in testimony at the trial Ms. Zamora disavowed that confession, saying she had signed it to help her boyfriend. ''I wanted to take the blame because I loved him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Instead, she testified, she merely wanted to talk to the girl her boyfriend claimed to have slept with and never wanted to harm her. She said she did not strike Ms. Jones but watched in horror as Mr. Graham shot the girl.</p>
        <p>To find Ms. Zamora guilty of capital murder, jurors must believe she killed Ms. Jones while kidnapping or trying to kidnap her. The jury was not given the option of choosing a lesser charge of murder, which would have carried a sentence of 5 to 99 years in prison. The jury is also considering charges of kidnapping, assault and false imprisonment.</p>
        <p>The courtroom was packed today as relatives and friends of both the dead girl and the young woman on trial waited with lawyers, court officials and members of the press.</p>
        <p>Four ministers and several members of the Assemblies of God church that Ms. Zamora's parents attend were there to show support. The parents of Ms. Jones sat on one side of the courtroom while Ms. Zamora's family sat on the other.</p>
        <p>Deirdre Jones, an alternate juror and no relation to the dead girl, expressed surprise that jurors were taking so long to reach a decision.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jones refused to say whether she would have voted for a conviction had she not been excused before deliberations, instead pointing to discrepancies between Ms. Zamora's testimony and those of the friends who testified she had told them of her role.</p>
        <p>''That's what you have to decide -- whether you believe them or whether you believe her,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But, Ms. Jones added, ''there was a lot of evidence that wasn't circumstantial,'' like blood from the dead girl that was found in Ms. Zamora's car.</p>
