        <p>In the Stanford Alumni Association winter travel brochure, listings for walking tours in Tuscany, cruises to the Galapagos Islands and whale watching in Mexico compete with the latest frontier in adventure travel: outer space.</p>
        <p>''If a journey to space has been one of your life's great dreams, this is the trip for you,'' coaxes the brochure, which waxes eloquent about the thrills of weightlessness on a quick trip aboard a private spacecraft and of making home videos of Earth's curvature at 62 miles above the planet surface. Follow-up callers are told that the trip will cost $98,000 and that the first launching is scheduled for Dec. 1, 2001, pending Federal Aviation Administration approval.</p>
        <p>It is an ambitious plan and timetable, with numerous possibilities for cancellation or delay. But the idea of space tourism -- once confined to Star Trek conventions -- is winning adherents in increasingly serious circles.</p>
        <p>''We've gone to Irian Jaya in Indonesia, we've gone to the Arctic, we've tried to go through the Northwest Passage on a Russian icebreaker,'' said Duncan Beardsley, the Stanford alumni travel director. ''Why not space?''</p>
        <p>The sentiment was echoed by Tom Rogers, a pioneer in the commercial use of space.</p>
        <p>''We are no longer in the laughing phase,'' said Mr. Rogers, who is president of the Space Transportation Association, an aerospace industry group. ''For years, we brought space to the American public. Now we want to bring the American public to space.''</p>
        <p>Plans for space tourism, for less expensive satellite launchings and for same-day global package deliveries are fueling a surge in private research on reusable space vehicles, Mr. Rogers and other aerospace experts said in interviews last week.</p>
        <p>To encourage the emergence of a 21st-century Lindbergh, a St. Louis foundation is offering the X Prize, $10 million to the first private team that successfully sends a spaceship with three adults on board to 100 kilometers in altitude and back two times in two weeks. That distance barrier, the equivalent of 62 miles, has been crossed by fewer than 500 people, all in government programs, and is internationally recognized as ''astronaut altitude.''</p>
        <p>Sixteen teams, 12 American and 4 foreign, have registered for the competition, which seeks to stimulate space travel the way that the race to fly from the United States to Paris in the 1920's stimulated commercial aviation.</p>
        <p>''When Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, he changed the mind-set of almost every human on the planet,'' said Peter H. Diamandis, chairman of the St. Louis group, the X Prize Foundation. ''That is what we are trying to do here, change the public perception that space is not just for astronauts anymore. By 2001, we will have a winner.''</p>
        <p>If recent developments are a measure, minds are rapidly changing. NASA is drawing up plans to open an office of ''space travel and tourism'' this year, to help entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>''Make no mistake, it is the private sector that will finally build the machines and provide the access to space that makes the dream a reality for all Americans,'' the NASA Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, said at the announcement of the X Prize, a reference to aerospace experiments, in May 1996.</p>
        <p>The explosion in private interest was evident last week at the First Commercial Space Transportation Forecast Conference, held by the Federal Aviation Administration in Arlington, Va. Revenues of the commercial space industry are expected to hit $1.6 billion this year, five times the level of 1993, F.A.A. officials told conferees. Satellite launchings by American companies have tripled in three years and may soon reach 100 a year.</p>
        <p>''Satellites allow me to go to Wall Street and have substantial discussions with people about money,'' said Robert Zubrin, chief scientist of Pioneer Rocketplane, an aerospace company in Lakewood, Colo., that is competing for the X Prize. ''Satellites are now being launched by rocket for $15 million each. We could launch them for $5 million with our Rocketplane and still make money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zubrin seeks to build a reus able spacecraft that would use high-altitude refueling.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Zubrin said he knew of 1,200 satellite launchings planned for the next seven years, he predicted that the 21st-century market would be in high-speed orbital space travel connecting major Earth destinations. He discounted skeptics who say that aside from Senator John Glenn the general public will not want to travel in space.</p>
        <p>'' 'Grandma will never fly that way' -- well, that is what the railroad people said about airplanes in 1910,'' Mr. Zubrin said. ''Well, if a spaceship can get grandma from New York to Sydney in one hour, she'll go.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, although space ebbs and flows in the headlines, opinion surveys show a deep longing for space travel by the public. According to a survey in 1993 for the Japanese Rocket Society, a private group, 30 percent of American respondents and 50 percent of Japanese respondents said they would spend three months of their salaries for short rides in space.</p>
        <p>''New designs for low-cost reusable launch vehicles could profitably fly about a million tourists per year to orbiting 'space hotels' for a round-trip cost of $10,000 to $20,000,'' Aviation Week and Space Technology, the trade publication, said in a 1997 study of attitudes in Japan, Europe and the United States toward space tourism.</p>
        <p>Zegrahm Space Voyages of Seattle, producer of the Stanford tour, has a seven-day package, six days of land training capped by a three-hour round-trip arching flight into space. Experiencing G forces no greater than the average roller coaster, passengers would briefly experience weightlessness after crossing the 100-kilometer mark.</p>
        <p>For the trip, a mother ship called the Sky Lifter would take off from a standard runway, holding under its fuselage a Space Cruiser, a six-passenger plane comparable in size to corporate jet. At 50,000 feet, the mother ship would pull away, allowing the Space Cruiser to climb to astronaut altitude, first under jet power and then with a burst from its rocket. After falling back into the stratosphere, the plane would restart  its jets and fly to the landing strip.</p>
        <p>Next year, the operating partner of the travel group, Vela Technology, plans to start testing a mother ship in the Mojave Desert. The system faces numerous tests before the F.A.A. will decide whether to grant a license.</p>
        <p>Zegrahm, believing it can meet its first commercial launching goal of Dec. 1, 2001, recently sent brochures to a mailing list of 2,000 names in 43 countries who had contacted the company for information. Twenty-eight applicants, including one Stanford alumnus, have made deposits of $5,000 each to a trust fund to guarantee reservations. Zegrahm hopes to send two flights a week carrying six passengers each. A pilot and a copilot would make up the crew.</p>
        <p>The ''Adventure Travel to Space'' brochure shows drawings of monogrammed souvenir spacesuits that each passenger will be able to take home. Another pamphlet answers questions like , Will all seats be window seats? (Yes.) and Will there be a bathroom? (Yes.)</p>
        <p>Some travel experts are skeptical that adventure tourists will travel any higher in the near future.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1980's, T. C. Swartz, who owns an adventure business in Seattle, took reservations for his Project Space Voyage, a trip planned for Columbus Day in 1992. Dozens of people, including 11 Stanford alumni, deposited money in escrow accounts.</p>
        <p>''Clearly the demand was there,'' Mr. Swartz said. ''Then the Challenger blew up, and that was the end of it.''</p>
        <p>The deposits were returned, he said, adding, ''I just don't see how two fundamental issues are going to be resolved: insurance and certification.''</p>
        <p>But advocates say that with enough test flights, those hurdles will be overcome.</p>
        <p>In the early 60's, Mr. Rogers of the space association introduced a technique that some people thought had a limited commercial future, bouncing television signals off a satellite.</p>
