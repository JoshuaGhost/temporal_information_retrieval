        <p>Managers at SEAT S.A., the Volkswagen auto maker in Spain, miscalculated when their new $2 billion factory opened near here in 1993 in the midst of a European economic slump, giving them the capacity to produce 50 percent more cars than they could sell.</p>
        <p>The investment led SEAT to four consecutive years in the red, 1992-95, the largest being a huge $1.1 billion loss in 1993 that included provisions for a $375 million early retirement buyout to help reduce the work force.</p>
        <p>Since then, however, the highly automated factory, 18 miles northwest of Barcelona at Martorell, has become one of the most productive in the Volkswagen group, and the zippy little SEAT (pronounced SAY-ott) cars finally started showing modest profits in 1996.</p>
        <p>''SEAT has recovered very strongly and very fast,'' said Pierre-Alain de Smedt, 53, who was tapped in late 1996 to run SEAT after heading Volkswagen operations in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
        <p>''A tremendous amount of work has been done inside the company,'' said Pedro Nueno, a professor at the University of Navarra's I.E.S.E. graduate school of management in Barcelona, which holds an annual conference on the automotive industry. ''Now the company has excellent models. They are in a strong position worldwide.''</p>
        <p>Volkswagen bought 75 percent of the state-run company in 1986 and the rest in 1990. VW has remained committed despite SEAT's slow profits, confident that it can position the brand abroad as a sporty car and upgrade its image in Spain, where for years SEAT was the only affordable car and the butt of comments about poor quality.</p>
        <p>But in the Volkswagen group, which includes the luxury Audi of Germany and the practical Skoda from the Czech Republic, a corporate spokesman conceded that SEAT still had more work than the other brands to carve out its own identity.</p>
        <p>''Volkswagen is a brand with an image going back many years,'' said the spokesman, Kurt Rippholz, at corporate headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. ''SEAT is at the beginning. It has the longest way ahead.''</p>
        <p>SEAT had profit of $42 million in 1996 on sales of $4.8 billion and will have higher profit in 1997 on sales of about $5.4 billion, Mr. de Smedt said, avoiding specifics until Volkswagen approves the 1997 accounts. But profits are still below the 6.5 percent return on sales that SEAT aims to achieve within five years.</p>
        <p>SEAT will not enter the United States market anytime soon, preferring to consolidate its 2.5 percent market share in Europe. It had double-digit sales growth last year in Germany, Italy, Britain and Portugal, and also in Spain, where it has a 12 percent market share. In all, 70 percent of SEAT's production of 400,000 cars is sold abroad.</p>
        <p>But it was not always so. The Franco dictatorship started SEAT in 1950, ceding a 7 percent stake to Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, and concentrated on building affordable cars for Spain's emerging middle class. The company was baptized as S.E.A.T., a Spanish acronym for the Spanish Company for Touring Automobiles; later it became known simply as SEAT.</p>
        <p>Even before Volkswagen's entry, SEAT had tried to polish its image. It quit calling its models only by numbers, like the ubiquitous SEAT 600, and started naming them for chic Spanish locales. SEAT's Ibiza, the best-selling car at home in 1997, is named after Spain's jet-set Mediterranean island.</p>
        <p>Volkswagen pushed for more improvements in SEAT performance and styling. The Ibiza racing version made its debut in world rally competition in 1996 and in 1997 won in its small-car category. And the engineering staff has doubled, to 400, at SEAT's secretive, gated research and design center on a bluff overlooking the sprawling 740-acre Martorell factory.</p>
        <p>The factory makes five SEAT models, which are sold in 60 nations, and three Volkswagen models, sold mainly in Europe. Two other SEAT models are produced at Volkswagen plants in Germany and Portugal, and another model is assembled at SEAT's old factory, 20 miles from Martorell in Barcelona's port area.</p>
        <p>SEAT's emphasis is increasingly on the Martorell factory, which cuts costs by using common undercarriages and a large percentage of common components to build various models of cars. An army of outside suppliers situated nearby deliver parts right to the assembly line, and the factory recently reached a rate of 60 vehicles per worker annually, one of Europe's most efficient.</p>
        <p>The factory employs 8,100 workers, representing 62 percent of SEAT's total work force. Martorell's daily production of 2,040 cars may soon increase to 2,200, and for the first time in SEAT's history the plant stayed open last August during Spain's traditional vacation month.</p>
        <p>But Manuel Gallardo Mendez, a leader of SEAT's highly unionized 13,000 employees, cautioned that while strikes were rare during the crisis years, the unions are worried about their aging members and want another early retirement buyout to make way for younger employees. In the 1993 buyout, the 3,000 longtime workers who accepted the offer received $125,000 each.</p>
        <p>Management is cool to another buyout, preferring instead to expand sales. But it did cooperate lately with the unions to redesign the factory uniform in beige, symbolic of a move to modernize in a nation where the blue worker outfit is still the norm.</p>
        <p>SEAT aspires to compete with Alfa Romeo and Lancia of Italy, company spokesmen said. But although it is planning for a more luxurious car, SEAT's most expensive car now is the fully equipped family-size Toledo, which costs only about $19,000, considerably less than similar Alfa and Lancia models.</p>
        <p>Despite the upmarket aspirations, SEAT's focus in the first half of 1998 will be on small cars. Its mini-car, the Arosa, retailing for $7,300, will switch production from a Volkswagen plant in Germany to SEAT's factory in Martorell.</p>
