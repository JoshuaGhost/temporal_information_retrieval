        <p>A momentous legal battle to save Canada was mounted today as the Government challenged the right of Quebec to secede without the agreement of the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>The federal Government went before the Supreme Court of Canada today for a reference -- in essence, a legal opinion -- on whether the French-speaking province could pull out of Canada after a provincial referendum like the one separatists nearly won in 1995.</p>
        <p>Government lawyers assert that unilateral secession would go against both the Canadian Constitution and international law. By taking a tough stand on Quebec, the Government hopes to resolve Canada's most divisive issue and end the uncertainty that has dangled over the country for more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>The Government is not denying Quebec the right to secede, since the Canadian Constitution does not declare that the country is indivisible. But Government lawyers insist that the Constitution does not allow the voters of just one province to determine the future of the entire country.</p>
        <p>Arguing what could be the fate of a united Canada evoked unusual passion in the courtroom. ''There is a lot of emotion in the air today,'' Yves Fortier, a Montreal lawyer representing the Government, said in his opening remarks at the court in Ottawa. But, he said, ''our argument is based solely on the law.''</p>
        <p>The Government's confrontational stance is a radical departure from the indifference with which it treated the 1995 referendum, at least until the last panicky days when the race seemed almost lost. The Government until then assumed that responding to the possibility of secession added credibility to the separatist movement.</p>
        <p>The danger of the new federal strategy is that it could further alienate the French-speaking minority in Quebec. Hundreds of angry Quebecers led by federal and provincial leaders demonstrated outside the Supreme Court today.</p>
        <p>The province refuses to participate in the case and its position is being represented by a court-appointed lawyer.</p>
        <p>The lead editorial today in Le Devoir, a separatist newspaper in Montreal, said that a court decision against Quebec would mean that ''morality will no longer be on the side of Canadian law.'' Both separatist and nationalist leaders have already condemned the court case as an attempt to frighten Quebecers.</p>
        <p>''Don't be taken in,'' Jacques Brassard, Quebec's intergovernmental affairs minister, told the province's seven million residents at a news conference in Quebec. ''Continue to be completely convinced that as a people, you have the right to decide our future.''</p>
        <p>The federal Government has asked the Court to rule on three narrow questions:</p>
        <p>*Does the Canadian Constitution allow Quebec to unilaterally secede?</p>
        <p>*Does international law give Quebec the right to unilaterally secede?</p>
        <p>*If there is a conflict between the two, which would take precedence: domestic or international law?</p>
        <p>The hearings before the Supreme Court are scheduled to continue throughout the week. No decision is expected for several months.</p>
        <p>Jeff Rose, senior fellow at The Harrowston Program on Conflict Management and Negotiation at the University of Toronto, said the federal Government clearly has decided that the potential benefits of the new approach outweigh the risks.</p>
        <p>''What the federal Government is doing,'' Mr. Rose said, ''is undermining the casual belief among millions of Quebecers that after a ''yes'' vote everything will be simple and will follow the idealistic assumptions of sovereigntist leaders.''</p>
        <p>The Premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, has condemned the federal Government's actions in defiant speeches that accuse it of trying to stamp out Quebec's ''sacred right'' to control its destiny. ''As far as we're concerned, the last word depends on the people of Quebec,'' he said at the University of Montreal last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bouchard has threatened to hold another referendum soon after the next provincial elections, which he can call as soon as this spring.</p>
