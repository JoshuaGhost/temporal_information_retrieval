        <p>Some people shrink when all eyes are upon them. Others never seem more potently alive.</p>
        <p>Ruby Dee most certainly belongs in the latter category. Standing on the stage of the Kaye Playhouse, where she is appearing in her new solo show, ''My One Good Nerve,'' Ms. Dee is so energized and in her element that she seems perfectly able to run through all her material, twice. And after that, maybe do card tricks. And then recite some Shakespeare, perform a few backward somersaults and -- if the audience is not completely wasted -- dance a tarantella.</p>

        <p>Some people shrink when all eyes are upon them. Others never seem more potently alive.</p>
        <p>Ruby Dee most certainly belongs in the latter category. Standing on the stage of the Kaye Playhouse, where she is appearing in her new solo show, ''My One Good Nerve,'' Ms. Dee is so energized and in her element that she seems perfectly able to run through all her material, twice. And after that, maybe do card tricks. And then recite some Shakespeare, perform a few backward somersaults and -- if the audience is not completely wasted -- dance a tarantella.</p>
        <p>Based on passages from her own book of the same title, ''My One Good Nerve'' is an evening of poetry, goofing around and sentimental reminiscence disguised as confession. Fans of the sturdy television, stage and movie actress, married for half a century to her sometime co-star, Ossie Davis, will find her rhymes and stories sheer pleasure, particularly on the few occasions when Ms. Dee lets down her guard slightly and reveals something less than calculatedly theatrical about herself.</p>
        <p>Overall, however, the show is a bit of a muddle. Ms. Dee and the director, Charles Nelson Reilly, don't bother giving much structure to the material, and especially for those not familiar with her book, what is presented will come across as an aimless hodgepodge.</p>
        <p>There's a halfhearted attempt to impose a theme, the importance of words in Ms. Dee's life; she identifies herself in the program as ''the Word Worker.'' But you can't help wishing a little more care had been taken in selecting and organizing the strands of words she dramatizes.</p>
        <p>The actress -- looking terrific, by the way, in a floor-length black gown -- shifts subjects tentatively; you can sense the gears slipping here and there. She begins with a strained segment on love; then recovers in the next with a funny reading of some of her own fractured nursery rhymes. (The best is a trilogy about put-upon old ladies who lived in  shoes.)</p>
        <p>After that comes an unsuccessful satire about a conference on overpopulation, in which Ms. Dee, in the manner of Anna Deavere Smith, plays all the parts. Then she bounces back with an affecting story about her childhood in Harlem, and the female domestics who boarded in her mother's home ''on Thursdays and every other Sunday'' -- their days off.</p>
        <p>The whole evening follows this hit-or-miss pattern. While you might not say this about every person who tries a one-person show, you do find yourself wishing Ms. Dee would, in poetry or simple prose, talk more about her life and dispense with some of the message-laden stuff.</p>
        <p>An all-too-brief anecdote about an early humiliation, being cast as a witless maid in a radio play, hints at a poignance that never is fully expressed; there is practically an entire play in that one tale.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Dee is such a charmer, so at ease with herself in front of an audience, that she frequently transcends the shortcomings in her material. With her unfailing good humor, her decency and common sense, she seems a kind of model citizen, someone worth getting to know. ''My One Good Nerve'' lays out the welcome mat for Ms. Dee's admirers, but you're left with the feeling that you never get to see much past the front door.</p>
