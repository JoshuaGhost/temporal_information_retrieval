        <p>President Suharto of Indonesia is not accustomed to sharing power. So when the International Monetary Fund suggested he could lose $43 billion in loans to bail out his economy unless he manages things the fund's way, it created a nasty standoff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto wanted to stabilize Indonesia's devalued currency by fixing it to a specific rate, and defending that rate with foreign currency reserves. But those reserves are pretty scarce. Many thought his real motive might be to get his family's fortune out of the country while the exchange rate was good. By week's end, he hinted he might postpone the idea for a little while, until his bankers calm down.</p>
