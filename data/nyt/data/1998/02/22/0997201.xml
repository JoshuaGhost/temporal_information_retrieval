        <p>IS there real life after basketball, ice hockey, indoor soccer and Girl Scout cookie sales?</p>
        <p>Joanne and Wayne Carmichael of Jacobstown insist there is, even though their four children, ages 7 through 14, are all caught up in such doings. And school, of course. And, Mrs. Carmichael groans, television.</p>
        <p>But what about theater, art, music: those replenishing things that Mrs. Carmichael calls ''something more''? For a family of six to attend professional live theater, finding the time and money can be an unmanageable, perhaps unimaginable, stretch.</p>
        <p>Not just for arts-conscious parents like the Carmichaels, the New Jersey Theater Group has designated next Sunday through March 8 as Family Week at the Theater. Youngsters ages 5 to 18 will receive a free ticket for every adult ticket bought to a show at many theaters in the group, a consortium of the state's 29 full- or partial-Equity theaters.</p>
        <p>The first-time event, tied to Arts in Education Month, includes full performances (''Death of a Salesman'' at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn), samplings (the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' by the theater's touring company in a streamlined hourlong version at the Newark Museum), and plays by students (Madison Young Playwrights Festival, a continuing project of the Playwrights Theater of New Jersey), as well as workshops in improvisations, acting and stage combat, rehearsals, backstage tours and conversations with casts.</p>
        <p>For two of Paper Mill's ''Salesman'' performances, the doors will open for a sort of early-bird special, at 7 P.M. instead of 8. The hour, called ''Get the Scoop on Theater,'' is devoted to a look behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>All told, 50 events are scheduled for the week, of which 24 are free and 26 offer the one paid, one free ticket deal. Individual theaters will offer other discounts.</p>
        <p>''Exposure to the arts should be considered an everyday event,'' said Bonnie J. Monte, artistic director of the Shakespeare Festival. ''Theater shouldn't be a sporadic privilege.''</p>
        <p>Ricardo Kahn of the Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick added, ''What more wonderful celebration of life than for people to enter into the magic and imagination of live theater as families?'' Meetings with the cast are planned after two performances of ''Crumbs From the Table of Joy,'' a new play at Crossroads.</p>
        <p>If a theater's current production does not rate a family-fare seal of approval, like ''The Gimmick,'' Dael Orlandersmith's in-your-face one-woman play at the McCarter in Princeton, then that theater collaborates with another on a different event. The McCarter and the Playwrights Theater of New Jersey are joining forces in two free workshops for ages 10 and up.</p>
        <p>Even with restrictions, the variety of performances is expansive, from the Pushcart Players, the state's leading children's theater, which is to travel from Trenton to Cape May with two productions for ages 3 and older, to the tryout of a new musical about the British comedy legend Beatrice Lillie, ''A Marvelous Party'' at Luna Stage in Montclair.</p>
        <p>''We've never done anything like this before, and we don't know what will happen,'' said Elizabeth Murphy, the group's director of marketing. ''But the response has been phenomenal, and we know that making theater affordable -- reaching out to families, for fun and for education -- must be continued. Mothers are saying, 'We could never take our kids to the theater until now.' ''</p>
        <p>Laura Aden, the group's executive director added: ''The word is out. This may be the start of something big. Anyway, we're busy planning for next year.''</p>
        <p>And that's just fine with Mrs. Carmichael. ''I'm a stay-at-home mom, which is a financial sacrifice,'' she said. ''It's cost-prohibitive to expose our kids to the performing arts, but we have to. Even after they settle down, these are life's pleasures: theater, art, music. When you've achieved something, this is the reward, like the flowers in your backyard.''</p>
