        <p>One of the most secret documents of the cold war is out, 36 years after it was written. It is the Central Intelligence Agency's own inquiry into the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro that caused the deaths of nearly 1,500 raiders. With brutal honesty, the report put the blame squarely on what it described as arrogance, ignorance and incompetence within the C.I.A. itself.</p>
        <p>The report painted a picture of an agency shot through with deadly self-deception, and concluded that its secret operations were ''ludicrous or tragic, or both.'' The document also warned those who would use the C.I.A. to overthrow enemies that such efforts belong to the Pentagon.</p>

        <p>The litany of other errors included a budget that was out of control, officers who did not speak Spanish, and a ''complex and bizarre organizational situation.'' C.I.A. leaders at the time rebutted the report, written by the agency's inspector general, as motivated by personal malice.</p>
