        <p>IF you want to keep a secret, tell Sahir Islam, who won $5,000 in the ''Jeopardy!'' $100,000 Tournament of Champions and did not tell anyone for a month.</p>
        <p>Sahir, 17, a senior at Somers High School, taped what was broadcast as a two-week competition in Los Angeles on Jan. 13 and 14. Sahir made his final appearance on the program on Feb. 12 and had signed an agreement not to divulge the outcome until then.</p>
        <p>As the top contestant in the ''Jeopardy!'' Teen Tournament last November, Sahir was accustomed to keeping secrets. That time he had to remain silent about winning the championship, $26,300 and two computers -- one for himself and one for his high school -- for six weeks.</p>
        <p>''The main difference in playing against adults is they know more,'' Sahir said of the recent contest, which included top ''Jeopardy!'' money winners for the year, the college champion and two teen-age winners.</p>
        <p>Sahir, several months younger than his fellow teen-age player Josh Den Hartog, was the youngest contestant. In contrast to Josh, who had shaved his head since his original television appearance, Sahir grew a goatee after the last contest.</p>
        <p>The oldest contestant and winner of the tournament was Dan Melia, 52, a professor of Celtic studies at the University of California at Berkeley. Two of the most successful contestants were humorists. Others were librarians and writers.</p>
        <p>''This is the first year without a lawyer,'' Laine Sutten, a spokeswoman for ''Jeopardy!'' observed of the 13th competition, which has never been won by a teen-age contestant.</p>
        <p>To prepare, Sahir continued his tradition of having his friends quiz him, giving extra attention to topics like opera and the Bible because he thought older people would know more about them. The preparation worked, and his responses of ''La Scala'' and the ''Book of Ruth'' raised his score.</p>
        <p>He might also have consulted the Somers Superintendent of Schools, Richard Brodow, who appeared on an early television prize-show, ''Dream House,'' and whose wife won $10,000 on ''The $25,000 Pyramid.''</p>
        <p>Serendipity helped Sahir, too. ''I saw Neve Campbell in the Sony cafeteria, and one hour later there was a question about her,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sahir advanced to the semifinals with a rapid-fire recall of knowledge ranging from art and food to Yiddish and biology. He buzzed in at the right instant for questions about dysphagia, Anna Nicole Smith, Napoleon, Pete Sampras and marzipan.</p>
        <p>Even his wrong responses revealed a vast storehouse of knowledge. In identifying a World War II photographer, Sahir said, ''Who is Rosenthal?'' referring to Joe Rosenthal who took the shot of soldiers raising the American flag on Iwo Jima. The correct answer was Alfred Eisenstaedt.</p>
        <p>Sahir, who lost the semifinal round by misidentifying one of two Academy Award Best Pictures in the 1990's with one-word titles, gave an incorrect answer of ''Shine.'' But the correct answer is either ''Braveheart'' or ''Unforgiven.''</p>
        <p>''Sahir was a really good player and a nice kid,'' said Harry Friedman, the producer of ''Jeopardy!'' who was reached on his car phone in a Los Angeles traffic jam. He added that the program aims at smart people who are not necessarily intellectual.</p>
        <p>''Jeopardy!'' -- now in its 14th season with Alex Trebek as host -- has become a cultural icon. Trebek is a frequent answer in The New York Times crossword puzzle. A ''Cheers'' episode revolved around the quiz program, and a Taco Bell advertisement yet to be broadcast in New York features ''Jeopardy!'' playing in the background with a Chihuahua asking, ''What's a logarithm?''</p>
        <p>The answer-in-the-form-of-a-question format of ''Jeopardy!'' has become so pervasive that a recent contestant on ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' on the Comedy Central channel unconsciously responded in that inappropriate style much to the emcee's chagrin.</p>
        <p>Recent programming changes have been one-shot celebrity shows, taping the teen-age tournament in Washington and mothballing the seniors tournament. Categories have zippy names like ''Water, Water All Around'' rather than ''Oceans.'' Future plans include a ''Junior Jeopardy!'' for preteen-agers on cable television and a reunion of former teen-age winners.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Sahir will travel with the Somers High School jazz band to Boston and compete as a captain of the school's Academic Challenge team, a group of students who take part in scholastic competitions. He plans to invest his winnings in a mix of stocks and bonds and will enter Harvard, where he won early admission, or another Ivy League school this fall. Naturally, he will not tell which one he has chosen.</p>
        <p>Will the ability to answer in question form help Sahir in later life? As Alice B. Toklas said to Gertrude Stein on her death bed, ''What is the answer to life, Gertrude?'' Stein responded, ''What is the question?''</p>
