        <p>It's been a decade now since Doug Henning, the big-haired magician, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the big-bearded founder of Transcendental Meditation, announced plans to build Maharishi Veda Land, a $1.5 billion, 1,400-acre New Age theme park near Niagara Falls, Ontario. Veda Land was supposed to haul in six million visitors a year with unique attractions like a ''Magic Flying Chariot Ride,'' a ''Corridor of Time Ride'' and something called ''the world's only levitating building.''</p>
        <p>Zoom to 1998, and Veda Land is just Land: 700 acres or so of shrubs and junk a couple miles from the falls. Meanwhile, the project is still levitating somewhere between Maharishi Veda Land Canada's 13th-floor office in Toronto and the desk of Wayne Thomson, Niagara Falls's Mayor, who hasn't seen any of the required permits for the levitating building, or anything else for that matter.</p>

        <p>It's been a decade now since Doug Henning, the big-haired magician, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the big-bearded founder of Transcendental Meditation, announced plans to build Maharishi Veda Land, a $1.5 billion, 1,400-acre New Age theme park near Niagara Falls, Ontario. Veda Land was supposed to haul in six million visitors a year with unique attractions like a ''Magic Flying Chariot Ride,'' a ''Corridor of Time Ride'' and something called ''the world's only levitating building.''</p>
        <p>Zoom to 1998, and Veda Land is just Land: 700 acres or so of shrubs and junk a couple miles from the falls. Meanwhile, the project is still levitating somewhere between Maharishi Veda Land Canada's 13th-floor office in Toronto and the desk of Wayne Thomson, Niagara Falls's Mayor, who hasn't seen any of the required permits for the levitating building, or anything else for that matter.</p>
        <p>The affable Mayor has good reason to feel down: he's still dazzled by the prospect of what might be. In 1992, Thomson recently confided, T.M. bigwigs flew him out to the Maharishi's place in the Netherlands -- a Willy Wonka-like monastery -- to view the secret plans. ''I saw 40 or 50 people working day and night,'' he recalls. ''It was all very high-tech, you know, very spectacular. They spent millions on this plan, just millions.''</p>
        <p>Alas, Thomson hasn't heard from Henning or the yogi in more than a year, and the Veda Land staff is keeping silent. ''I'm starting to wonder,'' he says, ''if the Veda Land folks are working on a different time frame than the rest of us.''  SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1998: THEME PARKS</p>
