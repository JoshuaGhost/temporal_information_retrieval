        <p>Clyde Haberman, in NYC column, notes that Grammy Awards, which brings in estimated $40 million to local economy, may move to another city next year because of dispute between Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and Michael Greene, head of awards presentation; says city's fortunes are also reflected in huge number of out-of-towners applying to Columbia and New York University; says applications at Columbia are up 39 percent since 1995 and 16.5 percent at NYU since 1997 (M)</p>

        <p>WITH the Grammy Awards being held tomorrow night at Radio City Music Hall, it's none too soon to wonder if the recording industry's big show will move to another city next year and become, as a headline writer put it, the Scrammys.</p>

        <p>WITH the Grammy Awards being held tomorrow night at Radio City Music Hall, it's none too soon to wonder if the recording industry's big show will move to another city next year and become, as a headline writer put it, the Scrammys.</p>
        <p>As you may know, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been singing ''Hit the Road, Jack'' a lot lately. He feels that Michael Greene, the in-your-face chief of the awards presentation, has done insufficient penance for supposedly screaming obscenities and threats at a mayoral assistant.</p>
        <p>It does sound as if Mr. Greene's behavior was off the charts. But he tried to make nice by sending the aide roses. She threw them back. He then said, ''I'm sorry if I offended anyone.'' Not good enough, the Mayor said yesterday, calling it a ''phony apology.'' He wants an act of full contrition, something closer to the journey to Canossa that Emperor Henry IV made in 1077, when he appeared in penitent's garb before Pope Gregory VII. That, Mr. Greene suggested yesterday, is not about to happen.</p>
        <p>What elevates this above a mere spat is that Mr. Giuliani has said the Grammys can go back to Los Angeles, and the heck with their estimated $40 million contribution to the local economy. Shades of last year when the Mayor said he didn't give a hoot if the United Nations left town, taking with it the $3 billion-plus a year that diplomats spend here. (Despite his fondness for ''The Godfather,'' he has a way of standing a line from that movie on its head. Sometimes at City Hall, it isn't business; it's strictly personal.)</p>
        <p>Should the Grammys indeed leave New York, ''we'll replace that with three other things in a day,'' the Mayor said. Oh? Like what? So far, he hasn't elaborated.</p>
        <p>It would be lovely if the city could wrest the National Spelling Bee from Washington, especially since the reigning champ is a Brooklyn girl, Rebecca A. Sealfon. The much-reviled gathering of the Tailhook Association might make a nice catch. It would show patriotism and faith in the power of redemption. The Modern Language Association's conference, last held in Toronto, is always welcome.</p>
        <p>But let's be realistic. It may not be easy to replace an extravaganza like the Grammys, which not only brings in millions of dollars but also allows the city to show itself off before a global television audience of 1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Then again, who knows? Maybe the Mayor has a $40 million surprise up his sleeve. Maybe the Grammys will stay put. Anything can happen in a city as hot as New York, where even a report about flourishing prostitution can be seen as good news. Moralists may take offense. But if prostitutes do well, it means conventioneers and tourists are pouring into town.</p>
        <p>ON a different track, the city's fortunes are also reflected in the huge number of out-of-towners applying to the leading private colleges here, Columbia and New York University. The latest figures were announced this month, and they are truly startling.</p>
        <p>Columbia College has 12,111 students seeking a mere 955 places in the class of 2002. Applications are up by 39 percent just since 1995. N.Y.U. reports having received about 24,500 applications for 3,000 freshman spots, a 16.5 percent increase from 1997 and a remarkable rise of 115 percent in six years.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the two institutions are attractions in themselves. But give Mr. Giuliani credit. Both schools say that the safer, cleaner and livelier New York on his watch is where young people want to be, with their parents' blessing. For L. Jay Oliva, N.Y.U.'s president and a history professor, it evokes visions of pre-Renaissance Paris and Florence.</p>
        <p>''Universities in cities have returned to their medieval roots,'' he said. ''They're places of choice for people from all over.''</p>
        <p>Some might say his school has done almost too good a job. It has drawn so many students from other places that New York City supplies only 20 percent of its undergraduates. To help keep the N.Y. in N.Y.U., the school recently created 20 scholarships for locals, with money from the real-estate developer Lew Rudin, class of '49. It's a start, Dr. Oliva said, to make sure that New York does not lose more ground.</p>
        <p>Of course, should the city fall on hard times, the universities might be sitting less pretty, too. ''But you also know,'' Dr. Oliva said, ''that this city bounces and rebounds,'' which, to return to the original subject, is probably worth remembering should this personalized tiff with the Mayor cause the Grammys to hit the road.</p>
