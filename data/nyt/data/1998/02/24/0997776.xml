        <p>Making his official entry into a crowded gubernatorial race, Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, yesterday unleashed a torrent of criticism of Gov. George E. Pataki, saying that Mr. Pataki had stripped spending from higher education and mass transit.</p>
        <p>Standing on the steps of City Hall, Mr. Hynes, 62, added his name to the race for the Democratic nomination in a field that includes Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker; James L. Larocca, a former state energy and transportation commissioner; Richard A. Kahan, a developer and former chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, and Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross.</p>
        <p>But in his remarks yesterday, Mr. Hynes focused exclusively, and critically, on Mr. Pataki, a Republican, saying that Mr. Pataki's high standing in public opinion polls would dissolve once voters gave more scrutiny to his record.</p>
        <p>''It is a record which includes the abandonment of upstaters, by reneging on his 1994 campaign promise to revitalize that region of the state,'' Mr. Hynes said. ''It is a record of abdication of leadership of tenants' rights downstate, a record which undermines the financial stability of the SUNY system, a record that includes the largest increase of subway and bus fares in the history of New York City's transit system.''</p>
        <p>A phone call to Mr. Pataki's office seeking a response was not returned.</p>
        <p>Although his comments yesterday focused on Governor Pataki, Mr. Hynes faces the more immediate challenge of beating his Democratic rivals, many of whom are better financed and organized. In addition, Mr. Hynes is apparently not as well known to voters as either Ms. McCaughey Ross or Mr. Vallone, according to recent opinion polls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes is supported by the Brooklyn Democratic Party organization.</p>
        <p>His gubernatorial aspirations come just four years after another foray in statewide politics, an unsuccessful race for attorney general. He came in third in a field of four candidates in the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>So far, associates of Mr. Hynes say, he has about $150,000 in the bank. They add, however, that the Hynes campaign expects to receive $600,000 more once the figures from a fund-raising event last night are counted. Nonetheless, that would leave Mr. Hynes far behind two of his Democratic rivals. Mr. Vallone has nearly $2 million in the bank, reaping contributions from developers, unions, law firms and others.</p>
        <p>Last month, Ms. McCaughey Ross received a $2.25 million contribution to her campaign from her multimillionaire husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who is senior managing director of the New York investment bank Rothschild Inc.</p>
        <p>Fund-raising in the gubernatorial race has gained prominence and attention this year because of Mr. Pataki's unusually early and highly successful effort to stock his campaign coffers. Mr. Pataki has collected more than $12 million, including $6.5 million from the state Republican Party.</p>
        <p>For the last eight years, Mr. Hynes has been the District Attorney in Brooklyn. Despite his opposition to the death penalty, his office has prosecuted five cases in which he sought that sentence. Yesterday, he reiterated his opposition to the death penalty, but said, ''I have an obligation to follow the law.''</p>
        <p>He quickly added, ''When I become Governor, I will put the debate back on the table, because it diverts attention from the reality that the death penalty has nothing to do with public safety.''</p>
        <p>Responding to questions, Mr. Hynes said he lagged in the 1994 attorney general race because his campaign was not run by professional managers.</p>
        <p>''You learn a lot by losing,'' he said. ''I ran a race that was less than adequate. A lot of it had to do with the fact that I was running the campaign. That will never happen again. I assumed that I would do better upstate than I did.'' He cited his lack of experience as a campaign manager during that race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes predicted that he would receive substantial support from labor unions. ''A great many trade unionists will be with me because I've launched probably the most aggressive series of prosecutions against the violation of the prevailing-wage law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes, a Brooklyn native,  started his career as a lawyer in the Brooklyn Legal Aid Society. He was Fire Commissioner under Mayor Edward I. Koch and a special state prosecutor.</p>
