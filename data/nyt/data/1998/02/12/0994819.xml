        <p>Larry Hogue, a symbol of New York State's inability to treat mentally ill drug addicts effectively, has failed to report to a psychiatric outpatient program, alarming some Upper West Side residents who are fearful that he will return to terrorize them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hogue, once prone to wild and threatening outbursts, has not contacted case managers at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens for about a month, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The State Office of Mental Health, which provides services for people with serious and persistent psychiatric disabilities, said that given Mr. Hogue's history, case managers had been looking for him through his family and friends to determine what services he may need.</p>
        <p>Deputy Inspector Michael E. Collins, a spokesman for the Police Department, said yesterday that detectives were in touch with state officials and that beat officers would give special attention to areas Mr. Hogue was known to frequent, including the Upper West Side. His disappearance was first reported yesterday in Newsday.</p>
        <p>''We're ready to assist the state authorities in locating Mr. Hogue,'' Inspector Collins said. ''I'm not saying we're going to arrest him. There are no warrants out for his arrest.''</p>
        <p>But all of the effort is of little solace to residents along West 96th Street, Mr. Hogue's favorite haunt.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade, residents of the Upper West Side say, Mr. Hogue terrorized their streets, vandalizing cars and threatening elderly people and children as they passed by, saying he would set them on fire and roast their dogs. They say he was known to hover in the shadows wielding ice picks and knives.</p>
        <p>''If he's alive, he's going to make a reappearance,'' said Aaron Biller, co-chairman of the West 90's/West 100's Neighborhood Coalition, which spearheaded the effort to have Mr. Hogue committed to Creedmoor in 1992. ''We are alerting everybody on the community level to look out for him. We want him taken off the streets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hogue started the outpatient program in 1995, after being released from Creedmoor, where he underwent court-ordered drug and psychiatric treatment. He spent several months in a residential program that treats alcohol and drug abuse, which offered structure, but less security than a psychiatric hospital.</p>
        <p>Since his release, Mr. Hogue has been enrolled in an intensive case-management program, which involves maintaining frequent contact with a social worker and a weekly face-to-face visit, an official said. Citing confidentiality rules, officials would not release information about his medical condition and the specific terms of his release.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hogue, who walked away from Creedmoor in 1994 to get money for his pregnant fiancee in Bridgeport, Conn., while the state was on the verge of releasing him, prompted sharp debate about how to handle mental patients with histories of drug abuse and erratic behavior: Should they be institutionalized indefinitely or allowed to live in supervised homes with more freedom once their behavior is stabilized?</p>
        <p>The debate continues. ''He has the same rights as any other citizen,'' said Roger Klingman, spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health. ''Legally, all we can do is outreach, which is what we're doing now. It's not like parole.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Lehr, a West Side community activist who was instrumental in getting Mr. Hogue institutionalized, said yesterday that the system has to somehow be revamped in order to protect residents from people who do not necessarily need to be incarcerated, but need to be forced to receive help.</p>
        <p>''It's the system,'' Mrs. Lehr said. ''We shouldn't have to revisit this tragedy every three years. He's a victim, too. He hallucinates and sleeps in traffic like he's on the beach or a rooftop. This is a very sensitive community. This is the Upper West Side, but we're not suicidal.''</p>
