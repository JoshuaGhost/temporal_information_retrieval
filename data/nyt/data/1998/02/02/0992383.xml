        <p>Worried about itself late last year, the home video industry asked Yankelovich Partners, the survey company, to determine why renting movies on video was losing some of its luster as entertainment after almost 15 years of popularity.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the Video Software Dealers Association, a trade group, announced results of the poll, and, as the saying goes, the patient isn't in bad shape for the shape it's in.</p>
        <p>Analysts agree that enthusiasm for renting movies is not as high as it was in the mid-1980's, when the videocassette recorder was new and people took tapes home by the armful. Some decline is to be expected. In 1997, video rental revenues were down more than 4 percent.</p>
        <p>One theory holds that if people are indulging more in some types of entertainment, such as going to movies in theaters or surfing the Internet, they are necessarily spending less leisure time on other types of leisure activity, such as renting videos.</p>
        <p>But the Yankelovich survey of 1,807 people shows that this is not necessarily the case.</p>
        <p>For example, the study showed that heavy renters of videos (one or more a week) also went to the movies more often. Similarly, many frequent television watchers rented more films on videotape.</p>
        <p>In the study, only one form of home entertainment appeared to be cutting seriously into video rental: direct-to-home satellite broadcasting.</p>
