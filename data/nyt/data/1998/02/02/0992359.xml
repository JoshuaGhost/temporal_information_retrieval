        <p>By all means, somebody should bring back ''The Mod Squad.'' Remember Linc, Pete and Julie (''First they got busted, then they got badges'') striding side by side in their cool hippie clothes? They were young; they were intense; they just wanted to help. What if they had had cell phones, laptops and a getaway Range Rover?</p>
        <p>Of course, now that someone has created a late-90's version of that show, all the producers seem to have remembered is that the characters were a black man, a white man and a white woman. The new series, ''Three,'' has its premiere tonight at 9 on WB.</p>

        <p>By all means, somebody should bring back ''The Mod Squad.'' Remember Linc, Pete and Julie (''First they got busted, then they got badges'') striding side by side in their cool hippie clothes? They were young; they were intense; they just wanted to help. What if they had had cell phones, laptops and a getaway Range Rover?</p>
        <p>Of course, now that someone has created a late-90's version of that show, all the producers seem to have remembered is that the characters were a black man, a white man and a white woman. The new series, ''Three,'' has its premiere tonight at 9 on WB.</p>
        <p>Now we have Marcus (a k a Candy Man), Jonathan and Amanda. As played by Bumper Robinson, Marcus is ''a hacker Robin Hood'' who once changed the C.I.A.'s Web page to read Central Stupidity Agency. Jonathan (Edward Atterton) is a ''ladies' man, bungee jumper, rock climber and, most important, high-end art and jewel thief'' with a British accent. Amanda (Julie Bowen) is an orphan and a con woman with martial-arts skills. (And wouldn't you know it? Before the first episode is through, she has posed as a prostitute in the line of duty.)</p>
        <p>The biographies are recited by the Man (David Warner), who sends the trio mysterious invitations to a meeting at a 14th Street brownstone. There he explains that he represents ''a mix of government and business interests'' and that they'll either cooperate by carrying out daring assignments or be turned over to the authorities. They try to attack the Man, but he is protected by a wall-like invisible shield, just like the one in long-ago toothpaste commercials. The nostalgia just won't stop.</p>
        <p>The squad's first job is to steal $3 million by dawn, which requires Amanda to hang upside down, then to slide on her back dangerously near laser sensors. This is much like Tom Cruise's memorable scene in ''Mission: Impossible,'' but without the tension. As she does this, even the music sounds like the ''Mission: Impossible'' theme.</p>
        <p>Now the trio are to take the $3 million and pretend to try to buy the ''ultimate escape'' (a faked death that would fool Dr. Kevorkian) and catch the scheme's mastermind. It's all resolved in a final-confrontation scene straight out of a James Bond movie.</p>
        <p>At the end of the episode, Marcus, Jonathan and Amanda are whisked away on a luxurious private jet, where they enjoy the buffet and toast one another. Eventually, the Man explains, when they've paid off their debt to society, they'll be set free. And when they are, probably in 13 episodes or fewer, these attractive actors may find better roles.</p>
        <p>THREE  WB, tonight at 9  (Channel 11, New York)</p>
        <p>Created by Evan Katz; Mr. Katz and Brooke Kennedy, co-executive producers; produced by Charles S. Carroll; Richard Paris and Linda Del Rosario, production designers. A production of MTV Productions in association with Paramount Network Television.</p>
        <p>WITH: Edward Atterton (Jonathan Vance), Julie Bowen (Amanda Webb), Bumper Robinson (Marcus Miller) and David Warner (The Man).</p>
