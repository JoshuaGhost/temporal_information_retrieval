        <p>In winter this is a kingdom of gray, where ashen skies rule over steely waters and dour men fight the gloom by planning for ''next season.''</p>
        <p>But unlike years past when the docks here rang with the sound of repair and the voice of hope, Prince Rupert's waterfront is now almost silent. Nobody is scraping the green rot from the old wooden salmon boats; there is no fresh paint, no new nets.</p>
        <p>''We're the cheapest in town, and still nobody can afford us,'' said Rudy Morrison, a Kispiox band Indian who, with a friend, repairs wooden boats. This year he has no work. ''It's pretty bleak,'' he said.</p>
        <p>These are difficult days for this tough frontier town that has known more than its share of triumph and tragedy since its founding almost a century ago as the western terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. Fishermen are locked in a bitter dispute with competitors in Alaska, just 40 miles away, over rights to dwindling salmon stocks.</p>
        <p>The struggle came to a peak last summer. Two hundred Canadian fishing boats blockaded an Alaskan ferry to protest the lack of progress on a fishing rights treaty.</p>
        <p>That got Washington's attention all right, but instead of getting a new salmon treaty, the Canadians got sued by the Alaska government.</p>
        <p>Alaska officials, who insist that American fishermen are taking only the salmon to which they are legally entitled, have offered to drop the suit if the Canadian fishermen agree to drop their countersuit and never take out their frustration on the ferry again. The Canadians have until Feb. 6 to make up their minds.</p>
        <p>Whatever they decide, it's not just the Alaskan dispute that has got people here so depressed. Salmon prices are down. Competition from Chilean salmon farms is fierce. Bickering among commercial fishermen, sports fishermen and indigenous groups never ends. There's an outbreak of white spot disease that will severely limit this year's take. One of the few remaining canneries has just closed and production at another is down more than anyone can remember.</p>
        <p>Then there's the big wood pulp mill that went bankrupt last summer; only an on-again, off-again provincial bailout can save the 763 jobs there. Several downtown stores have shut; hotels and gas stations are hurting. The fishermen's union had to raise money to buy Christmas presents for members' children.</p>
        <p>When wolves were spotted prowling the outskirts of Prince Rupert last fall, many here saw it as a symbol of just how much had gone wrong in 1997.</p>
        <p>''Frustration was probably at its high last summer,'' said Des Nobels, a salmon fisherman for most of the last 20 years. ''Now we're into despair.''</p>
        <p>From the deck of the Vonni Dee, Mr. Nobels' tight little salmon boat, it's easy to see why. Docked right alongside is the Pamora, with big chunks missing from its wooden deck. Its owner, a longtime fisherman, finally decided to sell to the government's buy-back program, a Canadian effort to reduce the number of salmon fishermen.</p>
        <p>Not far away there are ''For Sale'' signs on four other boats, including one so dripping with rot that its name is illegible.</p>
        <p>''This dock should be rocking by now,'' said Mr. Nobels, one of the angry fishermen who circled their boats around the Alaskan ferry last July. He said Prince Rupert's fishermen would normally be busy making repairs by now, the sting of last year soothed by the prospects of a new season.</p>
        <p>''Now they all dread the coming of another season,'' said the 44-year-old fisherman, who is so much a man of the sea that he has never owned a car. ''It's like, 'What's going to happen now?' ''</p>
        <p>The optimism that usually buoys fishermen has traditionally been as natural a part of life here as the ocean tides. It enticed men like Bill Gilker -- who learned to walk aboard his father's troller, the Old Chum -- to make their own life on the sea. These days, he and his father, Dick, 66, take the Old Chum out together. But sometimes there is barely enough fish for one of them to make a living.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't look good,'' said the younger Mr. Gilker, who is 40. ''I can't make any plans.''</p>
        <p>More fishermen in Prince Rupert are collecting unemployment now than ever before. More are discouraged than ever before. Some are so fed up that they think about quitting, the way Bob Warren did just before salmon season last year.</p>
        <p>''What with prices dropping and getting beaten to death by regulations and politics, there's just no life left in the industry,'' said Mr. Warren, 39, now the manager of the 7-Eleven store on Second Avenue. After 16 years in the industry, he sold his cherished boat, the Ocean Wave, for $20,000. His salmon license went for $120,000. The closest he's got to fishing since then is the herring bait he sells at the 7-Eleven.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing just disgusted me,'' he said over a Diet Coke at a coffee shop near the waterfront.</p>
        <p>The Mayor of Prince Rupert, Jack D. Mussallem, agrees that 1997 was a disastrous year, but some lessons were learned.</p>
        <p>''After you get beyond the frustration, bravado and rhetoric that comes with that, you sit down and discuss the issues,'' Mr. Mussallem said. What it comes down to now is painfully clear. ''We can no longer rely on salmon coming in here and being stuffed in a can,'' the Mayor said.</p>
        <p>There's a plan to attract an aluminum smelting plant, and a pig iron foundry, but there are no guarantees. The Mayor also thinks it's possible to get small cruise ships to drop off and pick up tourists at the waterfront.</p>
        <p>At the Fish Hall, site of the fishermen's union offices, more attention is also being paid to alternatives to salmon. Since many fisherman never made it to the 10th grade, adult education courses are held most days and union officials desperately try to find the men new jobs.</p>
        <p>Even a traditionalist like Mr. Nobels, who still uses a wooden reel for his long lines, is thinking about syndicating the fishing column he writes for the local weekly, just in case the fishing runs out.</p>
        <p>Today's residents of Prince Rupert seem to retain a bit of the optimism -- some of it ill fated -- that used to so embody this place that the local newspaper was originally called The Prince Rupert Optimist.</p>
        <p>That was back in the days when Charles Melville Hays, an Illinois wheeler-dealer, decided to make this spot not only the terminus of his Grand Trunk Railroad but an important city that could rival another west coast port, Vancouver.</p>
        <p>Today there's a bronze statue of Charlie next to city hall, and a plaque that explains how he went to England in 1912 and raised money for the further development of Prince Rupert.</p>
        <p>He sailed back on the Titanic. In a memorial to him in The Optimist, now The Daily News, he was given Prince Rupert's highest accolade. They called him ''a dreamer of high dreams.''</p>
