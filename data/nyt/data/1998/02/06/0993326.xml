        <p>John Starks sat with the slumped posture and blank stare of a teen-ager in the back row of a class. Wiped out, totally.</p>
        <p>This was not the vibrant, wide-eyed Starks you know. This was the one who plopped down in front of his locker after the Knicks lost to Minnesota, 95-88, Wednesday, with his body fresh out of miracle shots -- again.</p>
        <p>''I have to kick myself in the tail,'' said Starks, who has hit just 23 of his last 63 shots. ''I can do more for this team, and right now I'm just not doing it.''</p>
        <p>No one is delivering on cue. This has been a pattern for the Knicks during a disturbing 1-5 stretch by a team that is now a mediocre 10-10 without Patrick Ewing as it enters the All-Star break.</p>
        <p>''We're .500 since Patrick went out, and we've struggled in every win to win it, and we've been right there in every loss,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''We have to find more ways to win if we're going to make the playoffs because it's going to take the mid-40's and on up to make the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks are 25-21, and sitting eighth among Eastern Conference teams. Missing the playoffs once seemed unfathomable for a team stocked with more than $200 million in player contracts. And that was the total after Ewing, who signed a $68 million deal this summer, had season-ending wrist surgery.</p>
        <p>But suddenly a team that was squeezing big plays out of its cameo players -- whether it was Starks, Allan Houston, Charles Oakley or Larry Johnson -- has been unable to ad-lib without its superstar. At first, the Knicks seemed liberated, unpredictable and on top of their game without Ewing. They had beaten the Nets and Seattle at the buzzer, and had a victory against Indiana. The Pacers were part of a four-game winning streak that had everyone buzzing about the Knicks.</p>
        <p>But then a strange thing happened on the way to the All-Star break: the pixie dust wore off. Remember when Charlie Ward was the best 3-point shooter this side of Reggie Miller? Ward has hit just 6 of his last 26 3's (23 percent) over the last six games.</p>
        <p>And there was a time when Charles Oakley was coming up with routine double-doubles, but of late he is averaging just 8.5 points per game and shooting 40.7 percent. Not so long ago, everything Starks launched from his hip pocket went in, but he has shot just 36.5 percent during the Knicks' slump.</p>
        <p>It has not helped that the big men have been ailing, either. Both Chris Dudley (back) and Buck Williams (knee) have missed playing time because of injuries. Of the main players, only Johnson has been alive on a consistent basis. He has shot 47 percent over the Knicks' last six games.</p>
        <p>''Other than Larry, I think we've all been up and down,'' Van Gundy said. ''We're just not playing very well.'' Other teams have sensed the disarray. Teams like Milwaukee and Minnesota believe they have a shot to beat the Knicks without the intimidating presence of Ewing.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you can see it in another team's eyes,'' Houston said. ''I think what this last stretch has taught us is that when we had a four-game winning streak, we had a cockiness and attitude of, we're going to win the game. I think now, no matter who we play -- and it doesn't matter if it's the team with the worst record right now -- we think we're going to be in for a close game. We can't approach games like that. I think it carries over in how we play.''</p>
        <p>Shots the Knicks once made are not falling anymore, like the free-throw attempt by Johnson in the closing seconds of the Minnesota game or the 14-foot miss by Houston in a final push to get past Milwaukee. If the Knicks are not missing their shots, they are not getting defensive stops. Opponents are shooting 45 percent against them.</p>
        <p>When every game comes down to the final minute, every small detail counts. And turnovers have added up to disaster for the Knicks. Starks, alone, has had 17 turnovers in the last six games. Houston has had 21.</p>
        <p>''I know I have to pick it up, and know I have to play much better on both ends of the court,'' Starks said. ''I'm one of the key players coaches depend on and the team depends on. I have to look in the mirror and see what I'm going to bring in the second half of the season.</p>
        <p>''If it's energy we need, that's what we'll have to bring. And we'll have to bring it every night.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>CHRIS DUDLEY, who left Wednesday night's game in Minnesota with a sore lower back at halftime, underwent an magnetic resonance imaging exam yesterday. The test revealed a lumbar disk bulge. He will get treatment over the All-Star break.</p>
