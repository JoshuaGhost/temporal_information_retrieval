        <p>It's an unwritten Hollywood rule that action and special effects movies, like ''Titanic,'' go over budget. Unpredictable weather, computer glitches and expensive crowd scenes all contribute to soaring costs.</p>

        <p>It's an unwritten Hollywood rule that action and special effects movies, like ''Titanic,'' go over budget. Unpredictable weather, computer glitches and expensive crowd scenes all contribute to soaring costs.</p>
        <p>A corollary to that rule is that romantic dramas and comedies, like ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' or ''City of Angels,'' generally keep within tight budgetary constraints.</p>
        <p>And then, or so the buzz goes, there's ''Meet Joe Black.''</p>
        <p>One of the most anticipated films of the fall, ''Meet Joe Black'' is a romantic drama with Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani that has reached production costs of about $90 million, several agents and producers said. This would be a record for a traditional romance.</p>
        <p>Producers and agents with knowledge of the movie's finances said that the film was as much as $30 million over budget, although Universal Pictures, which made the film, says that figure is much too high. The movie, set to be released Nov. 13, was nearly three hours long but will probably be pared down to  two hours and 30 to 40 minutes, still at least half an hour longer than the usual romantic drama.</p>
        <p>Casey Silver, chairman of Universal Pictures, said that the movie, directed by Martin Brest, was over budget, ''but not insanely over budget.'' He said that the rumors proliferating around Hollywood about its  cost were not true, though he declined to say how much the film cost.</p>
        <p>''Marty Brest is a perfectionist,'' Mr. Silver said. ''This is a first-class production, and I committed to Marty that we'd be making this first-class in New York and Rhode Island.''</p>
        <p>''It's a great movie, a complete home run,'' he said. ''It's over two and a half hours in length and it didn't go anywhere near $30 million over budget. That's nonsense.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver added that Mr. Brest's two previous films, ''Midnight Run,'' with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin, and ''Scent of a Woman,'' for which Al Pacino won an Academy Award, had been profitable. ''This will be a commercial and critical success too,'' Mr. Silver predicted.</p>
        <p>''Meet Joe Black,'' adapted by Bo Goldman, one of Hollywood's foremost screenwriters, and inspired by the 1934 Fredric March classic ''Death Takes a Holiday,'' deals with a young man who recently died (Mr. Pitt) and who embodies death as a kind of Grim Reaper. He takes a holiday among the living, encounters a business tycoon (Mr. Hopkins) and falls in love with his daughter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brest is known here as a perfectionist, albeit a successful one, who labors over projects for years. One of his most successful was ''Beverly Hills Cop,'' the 1984 comedy that made Eddie Murphy a star.</p>
        <p>Why ''Meet Joe Black'' costs so much, in contrast to other romantic dramas, is not entirely clear. A coming Warner Brothers romantic comedy, ''You've Got Mail,'' starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and directed by Nora Ephron, cost $60 million to $65 million, mostly because of the huge salaries of the two stars and because it was made in New York City. ''Bridges of Madison County,'' another romantic drama, cost about $35 million and grossed more than $70 million. More recently, ''City of Angels,'' a romance with Nicolas Cage and Ms. Ryan, cost about $55 million and grossed nearly $80 million.</p>
        <p>Producers and others who are knowledgeable about ''Meet Joe Black'' attributed the high costs partly to slower-than-usual filming, which delayed the opening by about five months. That meant post-production offices were kept open far longer than expected.</p>
        <p>One person close to the studio said that the shooting was at least two months over schedule, which drove up salaries and overtime pay. In addition, an elaborate set as well as a swimming pool were built to serve as the glittering home of the Anthony Hopkins character.</p>
        <p>The sets included highly expensive rented antiques and furniture. Instead of using them for a limited period of time, said one producer, the filmmaker kept the stage home going for an extended period. .</p>
        <p>Various executives expressed surprise at reports of the high cost of the movie, largely because it will have to turn into a substantial box office success to earn its money. With marketing costs reaching $35 million to $40 million, ''Meet Joe Black,'' just to break even, would have to match the box office totals of a successful film like ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' which grossed $126.5 million. The potential, of course, is far greater: the record setter for a romance is ''Ghost,'' which grossed $217 million.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 21, 1998, Friday  An article yesterday about high production costs for the film ''Meet Joe Black'' omitted three authors of the screenplay. In addition to Bo Goldman, they are Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno and Kevin Wade.</p>
