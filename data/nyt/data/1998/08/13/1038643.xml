        <p>WWW.NWS.NOAA.GOV</p>
        <p>THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE is probably the most trusted and well-known source of weather information in the country. So naturally, its home page is focused on . . . good government?</p>
        <p>The top of the page is emblazoned with the insignias of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service. In between is an American flag and a weather vane.</p>
        <p>The first link is not weather maps, forecasts or conditions, but Our Mission -- a solemn promise to provide weather information and warnings ''for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy.'' Just below that is the agency's ''reinvention'' goals to be accomplished by 2000, a response to a Clinton Administration initiative called the National Partnership for Reinventing Government.</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah, and then there's the weather.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service site gets good marks for explaining, unlike any other site, how weather information is actually recorded. And users can select weather observations from individual locations, not just cities, which gives a context for understanding how close or far the observed conditions are to you (for instance, you can check Los Angeles International Airport, not just Los Angeles).</p>
        <p>You get wind, visibility, maximum and minimum temperatures and 24-hour summaries in addition to the conditions and current temperature (updated every hour). The National Weather Service also provides crop summaries, earthquake and tsunami reports and ultraviolet indexes for those who want more detailed information.</p>
        <p>It also issues official weather warnings. It summarizes severe weather warnings by state, so if you are looking for a flash flood, you will know if there is one on the way. The site offers videos of inclement weather, but they take a long time to download.</p>
        <p>When it comes to forecasts, the National Weather Service site offers an ''enhanced graphics'' version, which worked with mixed results: a page for local weather would not load because the server was down.</p>
        <p>For the most part, graphics on the site are nonexistent to rudimentary. That make the pages quick to load, but they lack the consumer-oriented bells and whistles that the average weather-hunting Web surfer might be looking for. As far as overall presentation goes, the site also requires looking at multiple pages and thus consumes more time than the other sites.</p>
