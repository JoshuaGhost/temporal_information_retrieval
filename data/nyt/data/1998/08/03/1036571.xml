        <p>For decades, vacationers have flocked to this resort's broad beach on the Atlantic, its big hotels and its quaint pastel Victorian guest homes, bringing a welcome infusion of cash.</p>
        <p>But the visitors have had a devastating effect on Cape May's underground water supply, depleting it to the point that, since 1950, two community wells have been abandoned after they became contaminated by salty ocean water that seeped in to replace the fresh water, and the use of two others has been curtailed.</p>
        <p>With the salt front threatening its fifth and last well, Cape May is installing the first desalination plant in the Northeast, becoming the northernmost of dozens of resorts and cities on the East Coast that have turned to desalting to offset strains on their water supplies. All are purifying brackish ground water that was once useless.</p>
        <p>The move toward desalination began in the late 1970's in highly developed resorts on Florida's gulf coast like Sarasota, Fort Myers and Cape Coral, said James Birkette, a consultant on desalination from Maine. Boca Raton and Hollywood on Florida's Atlantic coast also rely on the plants. Recently, desalination moved northward to Mount Pleasant, S.C.; Cape Hatteras and Nags Head on North Carolina's Outer Banks; Newport News and Chesapeake in coastal Virginia, and now, to New Jersey's southern tip.</p>
        <p>''It's a natural result of population growth and overstress on aquifers,'' Dr. Birkette said of coastal cities' growing reliance on desalting plants.</p>
        <p>The common denominators for the resorts, he said, are the steady arrival of new residents and tourists and the overpumping of aquifers, porous underground layers containing water. By allowing the resorts to use once-undrinkable salty water, the plants ease the strain on aquifers and help slow the incursion of salt water. When fresh water is removed in large quantities, rainwater and streams cannot replenish the aquifers quickly enough, and salt water then seeps in.</p>
        <p>In Cape May, summer tourism swells the population to nearly 40,000 from about 4,500 and pushes daily water demand on busy weekends to about 2.7 million gallons from about 900,000 gallons, said Thomas Phelan,  a former Mayor and now head of Cape May's desalination committee.</p>
        <p>Over the last 50 years, salt water has been spreading through Cape May's well field at an increasing speed. In the 1950's, the salt front crept northward at a rate of about 92 feet a year. By the late 1980's, the incursion had sped up to about 271 feet a year, according to a study conducted by the United States Geological Survey in 1992.</p>
        <p>Federal geologists estimated at the time that the salt front would reach Cape May's only unaffected well, No. 5, by 2000.</p>
        <p>''We had to take 1998 as the year it was going to hit, to be on the safe side,'' Mr. Phelan said.</p>
        <p>The salt front encroaching on Cape May is not New Jersey's first. Two others in the last 20 years have ruined hundreds of wells in communities along Raritan Bay and on the Delaware River south of Camden.  About $500 million was spent for a new reservoir, new water treatment plants and distribution pipes on the Raritan and Delaware Rivers, said water managers in the state's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Saltwater intrusion is also a problem, though a much less severe one, on Long Island, which gets all of its drinking water from aquifers. In Nassau County, water officials said, salty water has doomed two wells in Great Neck, which like Cape May is on a peninsula, and forced that community to drill new wells farther inland.</p>
        <p>Cape May's $5 million desalination plant allowed it to drive its first well into the deepest of five aquifers, which are stacked in layers beneath the Cape May Peninsula, and to begin treating the previously unused brackish water. That aquifer, called the Atlantic City Sand, is 800 feet below the surface and 600 feet below the Cohansey aquifer, which Cape May has used for its five wells. Cape May will cut back on its use of the overpumped Cohansey, which has been increasingly fouled by salt.</p>
        <p>State environmental officials had been prodding Cape May to rely less on the Cohansey in hopes of slowing the northerly march of the salt front toward the well fields of two neighboring communities, Lower Township and Wildwood, which also draw from the Cohansey.</p>
        <p>The new plant is to begin test runs early this month, and officials hope to have it operating by Labor Day. It is designed to treat 1 million gallons a day and can be expanded to treat 2 million gallons.</p>
        <p>The sodium chloride, or salt, level in the Atlantic City Sand's water is about 2,000 parts per million, far higher than both the Federal drinking water standard of 250 parts per million and the level in the Cohansey, which is up to 400 parts per million in the two wells that have been closed and in the other two fouled by salt. In the fifth well, the salt level is well below the Federal standard.</p>
        <p>The plant is intended to eliminate all the salt, said David Blair, project manager for Metcalf &amp; Eddy, the engineering company that designed Cape May's plant.</p>
        <p>Like the other plants on the East Coast, Cape May's relies on a filtration process called reverse osmosis. Under this process, the brackish water in the aquifer, which is considerably less salty than water in the ocean, is pumped at high pressure into an array of 40-foot-long tubes filled with rolls of semipermeable membranes.  As the brackish water is forced through the rolls, the chlorides are separated out, and that stream of brine is eventually discharged to a creek flowing to the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>After flowing through the membranes, the purified water reaches a hollow core at the center of the rolls and enters the water distribution network.</p>
        <p>Officials say reverse-osmosis plants are far cheaper to operate than desalination plants that treat sea water, which has chloride counts of 35,000 parts per million. These plants, common in the Middle East, use a technology called flash distillation, which removes contaminants by boiling sea water and condensing the steam. High energy costs have made such plants rare in the United States.</p>
        <p>Here in Cape May, Federal and state loans and grants paid the plant's $5 million in construction costs. The plant will add $1.25 per 1,000 gallons to the resort's summertime water-sewage charge of $14.53 per 1,000 gallons. Mr. Phelan of the desalination committee said he expected his family's water bill to increase about $85 a year.</p>
        <p>But the big hotels on the ocean use from 1 million to 8.5 million gallons of water a year, city officials said. The new plant will add anywhere from $1,250 to $10,625 to their annual water bills, they said.</p>
        <p>Residents and innkeepers seem more resigned to the rate increase than angry about it. After all, they have wrestled for years with the need for water conservation and threats the salt front poses for tourism, the backbone of Cape May's economy.</p>
        <p>Dane Wells, owner of the Queen Victoria, one of Cape May's 60 bed and breakfasts, said that through conserving water and raising room rates he would cover the higher water charge. But he said residents of towns north of Cape May should pay a surcharge to underwrite Cape May's higher costs because the resort city is cutting back on its use of the Cohansey aquifer to help keep the salt front away from well fields in those towns.</p>
        <p>''Because we're on the front edge, we're paying for rampant development north of us,'' Mr. Wells said. ''The state should charge others and the money should go to a fund to help Cape May.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells has reduced his inn's water use by installing pressurized toilets that use less water per flush.  And like many other residents, he has sunk a private well on his property for water to wash his car and sprinkle his lawn and flowers.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Mr. Wells began giving two- or three-night guests the option of using the same bed linens during their stay. That policy has cut water used for laundry by 20 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>But some year-round residents said conserving water has not saved them much money. Pat Dillon, a secretary at the Chamber of Commerce,  switched to low-flush toilets. She said the toilets cut her water use in half, but that did not save her money because Cape May raised water rates to offset the loss of revenue brought on by conservation.</p>
        <p>State officials say Cape May's shift to the Atlantic City Sand aquifer will require careful monitoring because it is the main source of water for resorts on a 70-mile stretch of coastline from Stone Harbor to the northern end of Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>Much of the aquifer in that stretch has been heavily pumped and contains a precursor of a salt front invasion: a huge V-shaped void that hydrologists call a cone of depression. Over decades, if overpumping continues, salty ocean water might fill the cone of depression, as it has done here.</p>
        <p>So far, monitoring wells have not detected any intrusion of salt in the Atlantic City Sand north of the Cape May Peninsula, said Robert Kecskes, a section chief in the state's Office of Environmental Planning. But, he added, state hydrologists and geologists are uncertain whether Cape May's pumping that aquifer will cause a salt front to pop up elsewhere on New Jersey's resort strip.</p>
        <p>If that happens, the options include more desalting plants, he said. But he said a more likely response would be to have the next generation of sewage treatment plants discharge treated effluent into the ground instead of the ocean, so it can filter down to aquifers.</p>
        <p>Any salt intrusion along the coast north of Cape May is years away, he said. ''We all believe there's enough time to react to it safely and inexpensively,'' he said.</p>
