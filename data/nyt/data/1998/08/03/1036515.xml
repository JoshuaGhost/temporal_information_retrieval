        <p>Richard Bernstein's July 28 Critic's Notebook offers several compelling reasons why 19th-century English-langage novels are more powerful than those written in the 20th century: the relative absence of war, a more positive attitude and less ''literary experimentation.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Richard Bernstein's July 28 Critic's Notebook offers several compelling reasons why 19th-century English-langage novels are more powerful than those written in the 20th century: the relative absence of war, a more positive attitude and less ''literary experimentation.''</p>
        <p>However, another fundamental reason, particularly seen in America with its Puritan roots, is that 19th-century novels often focused on issues of faith and the fundamental relationship between man and God. Emily Dickinson, whose mind, like many of the novelists', was constantly flayed by her lack of spiritual ease, wrote, ''I wonder how long we shall wonder, how early we shall know.''</p>
        <p>BARBARA KLEIN  Edgemont, N.Y., July 29, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is an associate professor of literature, Empire State College.</p>
