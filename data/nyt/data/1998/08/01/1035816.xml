        <p>Satu Khamphouy Sinnolai, one of the first Buddhist monks from Laos to take refuge in the United States and the first to arrive as a pastor to immigrants in the New York metropolitan region, died on May 28 at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Conn. He was 79 and lived in that city.</p>
        <p>The cause was prostate cancer, but he was active until a week before his death, said Damdee Kingsidaphone, secretary to the Buddhists in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>Satu (a title meaning venerable) Sinnolai was the abbot of the Thepchantharam Buddhist Temple in Bridgeport and a spiritual leader to Laotian and Thai Buddhists in the Northeast. Mr. Kingsidaphone said final respects to Satu Sinnolai would be paid on Sept. 5 at the temple.</p>
        <p>Satu Sinnolai was born on Feb. 16, 1919, in Ban Houei Sai, Laos. He became a novice when he was 12 and a monk when he was 21. In 1968 he became the abbot of the Temple Phonsavanh in Houei Sai, the capital of the Haut-Mekong Province and the home of hundreds of Laotians now living in the New York area.</p>
        <p>He fled Laos in 1978, stayed in a refugee camp in Thailand and continued to the United States in 1980. He founded the Thepchantharam Temple that year in Rye, N.Y., with the support of Laotian families.</p>
        <p>There are no immediate survivors.</p>
