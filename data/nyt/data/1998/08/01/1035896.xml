        <p>The International Amateur Boxing Association suspended two referee/judges, as well as one judge and one referee from the boxing finals at the Goodwill Games at the Theater at Madison Square Garden yesterday afternoon. The suspensions followed a formal protest by the Russian Boxing Federation and its delegation and an evaluation of the officiating.</p>
        <p>The Russian delegation believed that the judges and referees who were suspended were biased against its boxers. Macario Sosa of Guatemala and Alfredo Toledo of Cuba were the referee/judges suspended. Per-Olof Larsson of Sweden was the referee and Dieter Mika of Germany was the judge who was suspended.</p>

        <p>The International Amateur Boxing Association suspended two referee/judges, as well as one judge and one referee from the boxing finals at the Goodwill Games at the Theater at Madison Square Garden yesterday afternoon. The suspensions followed a formal protest by the Russian Boxing Federation and its delegation and an evaluation of the officiating.</p>
        <p>The Russian delegation believed that the judges and referees who were suspended were biased against its boxers. Macario Sosa of Guatemala and Alfredo Toledo of Cuba were the referee/judges suspended. Per-Olof Larsson of Sweden was the referee and Dieter Mika of Germany was the judge who was suspended.</p>
        <p>The Russian delegation was upset that its boxers had lost some close decisions in bouts on Wednesday and Thursday, and in a written protest yesterday morning it threatened to boycott the finals and take its team home, according to Arthur Tunstall, a technical delegate for the international association from Australia.</p>
        <p>Maikro Romero of Cuba defeated Aleksan Nalbaniyan of Russia, 10-5, last night, landing punches at will with overhand rights.</p>
        <p>Mario Kindelan of Cuba defeated Jacob Hudson of Augusta, Ga., 13-4, to win the gold medal in the 132-pound division. Andrei Mishin of Russia outgunned, outboxed and outclassed Larry Mosley of Los Angeles to win the gold medal in the 147-pound division.</p>
