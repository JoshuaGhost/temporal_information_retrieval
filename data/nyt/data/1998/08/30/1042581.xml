      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One of the most famous sports-car racing courses in the world, Goodwood Motor Circuit near Chichester, England, will officially reopen Sept. 18 to 20, looking much as it did when it made its debut 50 years earlier -- right down to the cars and many of the drivers of the era.</p>
        <p>In Goodwood's heyday, such legends as Jim Clark of Scotland and Stirling Moss of England competed there. It held its first event on Sept. 18, 1948, using the perimeter roads of a wartime air base, and will now be used exclusively for exhibition races featuring historic sports cars, motorcycles and Formula One cars from the 1950's and 60's.</p>

        <p>One of the most famous sports-car racing courses in the world, Goodwood Motor Circuit near Chichester, England, will officially reopen Sept. 18 to 20, looking much as it did when it made its debut 50 years earlier -- right down to the cars and many of the drivers of the era.</p>
        <p>In Goodwood's heyday, such legends as Jim Clark of Scotland and Stirling Moss of England competed there. It held its first event on Sept. 18, 1948, using the perimeter roads of a wartime air base, and will now be used exclusively for exhibition races featuring historic sports cars, motorcycles and Formula One cars from the 1950's and 60's.</p>
        <p>The increasing danger that accompanied faster cars was one of the reasons Goodwood was retired as an active track in the late 1960's. (Mr. Moss crashed there in 1962, suffering injuries that forced him to retire.) The 2.4-mile circuit was not modernized, but that is now one of its charms: a chance to relive the days when bold drivers raced Ferraris and Jaguars on tracks surrounded by hay bales and cornfields (organizers plan to have cart horses finishing the corn harvest within sight of the track, just as in the old days).</p>
        <p>Along with flyovers by World War II Spitfires, one of the weekend's highlights will be an exhibition race on Sept. 20 featuring Mr. Moss and the former world champions Phil Hill of the United States and Sir Jack Brabham of Australia.</p>
        <p>Advance-purchase tickets are $85 for the weekend, $17 Friday to $34 Sunday; at the gate, it's $25.50 Friday to $59 Sunday. Call (44-1243) 755055.</p>
        <p>The track is about 90 minutes south of London by car. It can be reached by taking the A3 to Milford and the A283 to Petworth, then the A285 to Halnaker, and following the signs from there.</p>
