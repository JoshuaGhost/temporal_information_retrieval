        <p>In an age when speed is king, Reid Stowe's plan to spend 1,000 days sailing around the globe might seem odd, especially since the trip can be accomplished in a tenth of that time. But  Mr. Stowe, who crossed the Atlantic twice on a homemade catamaran when he was 19, seems to court the unconventional.</p>
        <p>''I've always identified with the sea turtle,'' said Mr. Stowe, now 46, in a languid Carolina drawl. ''I like to cruise along in my home at a laid-back pace and take in the sights.'' That leisurely pace, nearly three years of nonstop circumnavigation, will be far longer than the 657 days at sea set by an Australian in 1987.</p>

        <p>In an age when speed is king, Reid Stowe's plan to spend 1,000 days sailing around the globe might seem odd, especially since the trip can be accomplished in a tenth of that time. But  Mr. Stowe, who crossed the Atlantic twice on a homemade catamaran when he was 19, seems to court the unconventional.</p>
        <p>''I've always identified with the sea turtle,'' said Mr. Stowe, now 46, in a languid Carolina drawl. ''I like to cruise along in my home at a laid-back pace and take in the sights.'' That leisurely pace, nearly three years of nonstop circumnavigation, will be far longer than the 657 days at sea set by an Australian in 1987.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stowe has long been planning to make his record-breaking voyage in a schooner he and his family built in 1978 in a neighbor's backyard in North Carolina. This November, after the hurricane season has passed, Mr. Stowe and his girlfriend, Laurence Guillem, 26, hope to push off from Pier 63 in Chelsea, where they have lived since last fall.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Stowe does odd jobs, repairs neighboring boats and welcomes a steady stream of curious visitors to the 70-foot, twin-masted vessel that he named for his mother, Anne. The couple live on the boat and eat all their meals there; a below-deck greenhouse provides the greens, and electricity and hot water are supplied by wind generators and solar panels. Two cats, Odessa and Tao, also live on board the ship, which is filled with Mr. Stowe's wood carvings and sculptures.</p>
        <p>To help pay the $1 million cost of the trip, Mr. Stowe has received donations and supplies from companies and individuals around the world. But he is still looking for a sponsor to supply the satellite communications equipment that will connect his expedition to the Web. According to his plan, digital video cameras mounted above and below deck will allow the public to monitor the voyage at all times. ''If people want to know what it's like to round Cape Horn in a storm as waves are crashing over the boat, they can,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stowe and Ms. Guillem see themselves not only as adventurers but as guinea pigs whose success or failure can help NASA plan its voyage to Mars. The period of isolation, stress of survival and size of the ship's living quarters, they point out, will be comparable to those of the Mars mission. ''Humans are evolving off the earth and into space,'' Mr. Stowe said, ''so in a way we're part of the vanguard of the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stowe said he wasn't worried about spending three years in cramped quarters with Ms. Guillem. ''I think it will be romantic,'' he said. While he has been sailing the globe all his life, Ms. Guillem, who is French, made her first 100-day voyage across the Atlantic last year. One of her biggest worries, she said, is her health and the well-being of the cats. ''Reid is a fish, I am not,'' she said. ''Actually, I am a little afraid of the water.''</p>
