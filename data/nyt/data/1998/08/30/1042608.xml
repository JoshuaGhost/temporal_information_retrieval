        <p>STEW LEONARD'S, the Disneyesque supermarket featuring dancing cows and singing milk cartons, will open its first store in Westchester as part of a new retail development now rising on a site near Austin Avenue off the New York State Thruway.</p>
        <p>It will be the first Stew Leonard's outside of Connecticut, where there are now two stores, one in Danbury and another in Norwalk. ''People from Westchester have been asking us if we were ever going to open a store there,'' said Stew Leonard Jr., the company president. ''They travel to our stores in Connecticut so we know we already have a built-in customer base in the county.''</p>

        <p>STEW LEONARD'S, the Disneyesque supermarket featuring dancing cows and singing milk cartons, will open its first store in Westchester as part of a new retail development now rising on a site near Austin Avenue off the New York State Thruway.</p>
        <p>It will be the first Stew Leonard's outside of Connecticut, where there are now two stores, one in Danbury and another in Norwalk. ''People from Westchester have been asking us if we were ever going to open a store there,'' said Stew Leonard Jr., the company president. ''They travel to our stores in Connecticut so we know we already have a built-in customer base in the county.''</p>
        <p>At a ground-breaking ceremony earlier this month Mr. Leonard was surrounded by a herd of Holsteins as his shovel hit a ''milk geyser'' that showered onlookers with a milklike substance at the site of the planned 122,000-square-foot store, which is expected to open by next summer.</p>
        <p>The new Stew Leonard's will be part of a retail complex that will also feature a 103,000-square-foot Home Depot and a 135,000-square-foot Costco, a discount store, both of which are already under construction.</p>
        <p>Like the other Stew Leonard's stores, the one in Yonkers will have features such as audio/animation robots that perform songs about milk and ''shopping at Stew's'' and costumed characters who roam the aisles welcomin customers and dancing with children. There will also be a petting zoo with cows, goats, sheep, chicken and geese.</p>
        <p>Unique to the Yonkers store will be an on-site processing plant for juices and a 300-seat ''hoe-down'' restaurant, which will feature country-Western entertainment.</p>
        <p>''It will be a Western-themed restaurant,'' Mr. Leonard said, ''with oak picnic tables and an atmosphere like a big steakhouse you'd see in the Midwest.''</p>
        <p>At Yonkers, he said, the focus will be more on prepared foods than at the chain's other stores. ''We'll be catering to the professional woman who doesn't have time to cook,'' Mr. Leonard said.</p>
        <p>Construction on the store had been delayed pending the outcome of a lawsuit brought against the development by the Town of Greenburgh, which opposed the reopening of a portion of Sprain Road for use as a secondary access route to the site. The only access now is from the thruway.</p>
        <p>Sprain Road would have connected the development to Jackson Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare. Greenburgh contended it would have caused congestion on its roads, placing an unfair burden on a municipality not benefiting financially from the project.</p>
        <p>Last February, the suit was dropped when Yonkers agreed not to use Sprain Road. The New York State Supreme Court in White Plains had ordered the Thruway Authority, which owns Sprain Road, along with Greenburgh and Yonkers to come up with an alternative access route, which is still being worked out.</p>
        <p>From its inception, the project has been plagued with access issues. When the Morris Companies of Secaucus, N.J., purchased 98 acres off the Thruway in 1981, the site was virtually inaccessible. Any project there hinged on building an interchange off the Thruway, which was completed by the county at a cost of $12 million in 1992.</p>
        <p>LOCAL residents were concerned about the impact of increased traffic on local roads. As a result, Yonkers closed Austin Avenue, a winding residential street. And attention switched to Sprain Road, a portion of which is in Greenburgh.</p>
        <p>''We're still going to need a secondary  access route,'' said Mr. Morris, chief executive of the Morris Companies. It's not so important for phase one, which is currently under construction, he said, ''but if we're ever going to get to phase two, an additional road will be necessary.''</p>
        <p>Phase one will include Stew Leonard's, Home Depot and Costco, as well as a so-far-unnamed multiplex movie theater.</p>
        <p>''We're having trouble signing a theater operator because of size,'' Mr. Morris said. ''I can give them a 60,000-square-foot theater, but most operators want double that.''</p>
        <p>The 98-acre site has been approved for 1.3 million square feet of development and 400,000 square feet are now being built, according to Mr. Morris. The second phase may involve office construction and hotels, Mr. Morris said. ''I'm talking with a hotel operator now who wants to build two or three hotels of different grades on the site,'' he said. The site, which is zoned for office construction, would have to be rezoned to allow for hotels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonard said that he had wanted to open a third Stew Leonard's for quite a while now. His company purchased a 50-acre parcel in the Town of Orange, Conn., which he intended to use for the third store.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut town, however, denied Stew Leonard's application for a zoning change that would have been required for the store. The company still owns the land, which is now being used for farming. ''We may reapply sometime down the road,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''We're still interested in the site and intend to hold onto it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonard said he really hadn't thought of Westchester as a site for one of his stores until he became aware of the Austin Avenue property. ''We didn't think there was any land available in Westchester,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''Now we realize this is an ideal location for us. It's far enough away from our other stores. And we can draw customers from a wide area.''</p>
        <p>Within a 10-mile radius of the Yonkers store there is a population of 1.9 million, according to Vincent D. Summa, chief financial officer for Stew Leonard's; the Danbury and Norwalk stores have 180,000 and 375,000, respectively, in a 10-mile radius.</p>
        <p>''We're expecting the population around Yonkers to be more ethnically diverse than at our other stores,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''We'll have to see if that requires different product or service from us. We like to wait and see, keep our eyes open and find out what we need to do and then do it.''</p>
        <p>THE Yonkers store is expected to provide over 700 full-  and part-time jobs with an annual payroll of $12 million. And Stew Leonard's expects to contribute $200,000 in property taxes to Yonkers and $1.5 million in city and state sales tax.</p>
        <p>John and Mary Annese, who live in Yonkers, have been anxiously awaiting the opening of the Austin Avenue store. They now shop at the Danbury store about twice a month in the nice weather.</p>
        <p>''We're looking forward to having a Stew Leonard's nearby,'' Mr. Annese said, ''but we may continue traveling to the one in Danbury as well. We have relatives in the area and go to the Danbury Mall. It's an outing, an escape from the hustle and bustle of New York.''</p>
        <p>That's one concern Mr. Leonard said he has about the Yonkers store.</p>
        <p>''I wonder how it will impact our stores in Connecticut,'' he said. ''I think there's plenty of room for all three, but we'll see.''</p>
