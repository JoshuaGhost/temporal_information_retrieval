        <p>FUR is not only back -- it's cool. So pronounces Vogue in its big September issue.</p>
        <p>The magazine reports that hip-hop has gone glam as rappers trade ''baggy for Bulgari'' and opt for a look that's ''less ghetto, more Gucci.'' The feature, called ''Rappers Deluxe,'' features Mary J. Blige, Lil' Kim and Missy Elliott in three of the most happening furs of the season. What would have been fashion suicide three years ago is now fashion chic.</p>
        <p>It is quite a makeover -- lynx has never been more phat -- and one that says a lot about where fashion is. As entertainment eclipses the design world as the culture's most influential taste-maker, glamour has become something you slap on like a fresh coat of paint, and personal style something you change whenever the mood strikes. Everyone's a chameleon. Take any girl, hire a stylist to the stars, borrow some jewelry and suddenly she's a Gabor. ''Renee Zellweger Goes for the Glamour,'' Vogue's cover promises, as the homespun actress shows the world her Oscar. (It's a de la Renta.) So what if you've never seen a Gretchen Moll movie? She looks like a star on Vanity Fair so she must be one.</p>
        <p>As a society, we've followed Madonna's advice of long ago -- ''Strike a pose,'' she once commanded -- and embraced rampant RuPaul-ism. We feel comfortable borrowing guises from other eras, other classes and other cultures, without stopping to reflect on their meaning. We've adopted a Village People approach to getting dressed. One day you're an Alexander McQueen cowboy, the next you're a John Galliano Indian.</p>
        <p>Playing dress-up is fun, of course. But when new fads are embraced constantly, it means that the clothes don't have much to say. An East Village girl in Sergio Valente jeans sports a bindi jewel on her forehead. Does it mean she's found religion or that she watches Gwen Stefani on MTV? Most likely, the latter.</p>
        <p>Fashion trends no longer speak of one's personal style but of one's media savvy.</p>
        <p>Piercings, tattoos, henna painting: it all seems calculated, coming from without rather than within.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Pat Boone tried to make a comeback as a heavy metal rocker, trading his white bucks, a genuine fashion statement of a mainstream pop idol, for black leather. It wasn't provocative -- it was preposterous. If Debbie Boone's father is wearing leather, it has no potency.</p>
        <p>Likewise, at any Tom of Finland party, hundreds of men will turn out in leather gear: advertising art directors, fashion editors, stylists and not a real biker in sight. On nights like the one last June at the Tunnel, so many were strapped in leather it seemed as if every gay man in New York had a harness in the closet hanging between his Armani and his Zegna. What was once an underground fetish has become just another look.</p>
        <p>Real leather men are too shocking for most of us today, like real punks were 20 years ago. If it's genuine, it is too intense. In college, I had my first truly punk experience. At a Bad Brains concert at Roseland, a friend and I stood at the front of the stage waiting for the hard-core band to come on. As a pre-show crush began to form around us, I naively said to my companion, ''Oh, I hope they're not going to slam dance.'' A four-foot-tall girl with safety pins through her ear, a razor blade around her neck and incredibly bad teeth looked up at me and scathingly asked what we thought they might do instead. I fled immediately.</p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I had a punk experience, 90's style. On the way to see ''The Avengers,'' I spotted three teen-agers who looked like Sex Pistol wannabes in their Trash and Vaudeville drag sitting on the curb on 19th Street, waiting for the theater to start seating. The big one wore red tartan bondage pants, a leather jacket covered in safety pins and a ripped T-shirt; his Mohawk, gelled into Statue of Liberty spikes. The other two, were in thrift-store tatters and Doc Martens, streaks of green Crazy Color dye in their purposely damaged hair. They were just goofing around until a pained cry pierced the night air. ''Ow! That actually hurt!'' the nose-ringed one shrieked.</p>
        <p>Kid Vicious had accidentally poked him in the face with his hair.</p>
        <p>''Affectation can be dangerous,'' the British style pundit Quentin Crisp once observed. He was referring to Isadora Duncan's penchant for scarves, but he could just as easily have been cautioning these kids.</p>
        <p>There's a little bit of poseur in all of us, to be sure, whether we're jet-set society women wearing Kabuki couture, working stiffs dressed in Ralph Lauren's off-the-rack version of Old Money, geeks in hula shirts and jams who do all their surfing on the Internet or suburban hip-hoppers in droopy pants hanging at the mall. But real style isn't just a borrowed fur or another look on loan. Even Marilyn Manson knows that. The rocker recently jettisoned his trademark goth image for a new glam one. ''If you're gonna pretend to be something,'' he told Rolling Stone, ''then you have to at least live up to what it is.''</p>
