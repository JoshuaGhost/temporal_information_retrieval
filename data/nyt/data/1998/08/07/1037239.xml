        <p>Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, were a band with a clear mission when they performed at Shine on Tuesday night. All they wanted to do was keep the crowd dancing, using any style from the last three decades. That meant James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, even some rapping.</p>

        <p>Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, were a band with a clear mission when they performed at Shine on Tuesday night. All they wanted to do was keep the crowd dancing, using any style from the last three decades. That meant James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, even some rapping.</p>
        <p>The lyrics, in Spanish, are mostly basic and blatant come-ons, delivered with smiling insouciance by Julio Briceno. And the music is a testament to smirking international cool, from keyboards that can sound like squeeze toys to interludes of whistling. Like acid jazz fans in London and lounge connoisseurs in Los Angeles, Los Amigos Invisibles treat their sources with mixed irony and affection. Their American debut album, ''The New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera,'' has been released on David Byrne's Luaka Bop label.</p>
        <p>Versatility is Los Amigos's most winning trait. It's the Swiss Army knife of groove bands, with a rhythm for every occasion; it may not be definitive, but it does the job. Its better material goes beyond simply  demonstrating genres to give them a Latin twist. One tune wandered from late-50's lounge music to Santana-style mambo-rock; another started with a funk guitar lick, then turned into a boogaloo 12-bar blues. It lived up to its chorus, ''para que te muevas mejor'': ''so that you'll move better.''</p>
