        <p>Nervous investors drove shares of the American Express Company down 6.8 percent yesterday after the company warned that its growth overseas would be hampered by the Asian financial crisis and by a softening of the global economy.</p>
        <p>''Given the interdependencies among markets, the effects of Asia will eventually spill over,'' Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express, told analysts at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. ''We can expect to see the impact of Asia on Latin America, and have seen it to some extent in Europe and the U.S.''</p>

        <p>Nervous investors drove shares of the American Express Company down 6.8 percent yesterday after the company warned that its growth overseas would be hampered by the Asian financial crisis and by a softening of the global economy.</p>
        <p>''Given the interdependencies among markets, the effects of Asia will eventually spill over,'' Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express, told analysts at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. ''We can expect to see the impact of Asia on Latin America, and have seen it to some extent in Europe and the U.S.''</p>
        <p>American Express is one of the most geographically diverse United States companies and, while no single company is a proxy for financial developments overseas, many analysts and investors look to American Express for insights about global business prospects -- particularly as they pertain to the company's core travel services and credit and charge card operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golub said American Express had hoped, within a ''reasonable time frame,'' to increase its overseas profit 25 percent to 30 percent a year, with earnings from abroad accounting for half of overall profit.</p>
        <p>''The current economic slowdown, however, is depressing the financial results of both our card and travel business and will likely delay our progress in attaining these 'mix' goals,'' he told the analysts.</p>
        <p>In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of American Express plunged $7.375 yesterday, to $101.0625, on nearly five times the normal trading volume.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the sky is falling because it's too early to figure it out,'' said Samuel Liss, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''I think the Asian problem and the impact of the euro on their foreign-exchange business are among some of the things they need to consider.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Golub spoke privately with the analysts on Wednesday, and the company did not widely distribute copies of his statements until yesterday.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Golub said he thought the company would ''continue to do well, but it will not be as easy or simple to match the performance of the last two quarters.''</p>
        <p>American Express has posted solid financial results lately, driven by an upswing in its card business and tighter expense controls. The company recently reported that its second-quarter profit increased 11 percent, to $578 million, compared with $520 million in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $4.8 billion.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Golub said there were important unknowns, including the possibility of further economic deterioration in Japan or a downturn in China, as possible ''risks in our ability to cope.''</p>
        <p>Another blow for American Express was its decision this year not to bid on the United States Government's card account, which had been an important account to the company in terms of billing volume and number of cards. Mr. Golub said American Express was not willing to go after a contract with the Government if a bidding war meant that that the profitability of its card business would suffer.</p>
        <p>Some analysts thought that the stock market overreacted yesterday to Mr. Golub's comments, noting that the warning was evidence of cautious management and a prudent approach, given current economic uncertainties.</p>
        <p>''I look at this company and think they have a lot of flexibility on the expense side and have a strong financial cushion,'' said Susan Roth of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. She added that ''all financial service companies are considering how their resources should be managed, given the spillover from Asia.''</p>
