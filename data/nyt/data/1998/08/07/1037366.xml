        <p>Joan Brown  George Adams  41 West 57th Street  Through Aug. 14</p>
        <p>Joan Brown, who began exhibiting in San Francisco in the late 1950's, anticipated what in the late 1970's came to be called''Bad Painting'' and ''New Image Painting.''</p>
        <p>This selection of works from the 1960's through the 80's (Brown died in 1990) gives a good sense of her cheerfully unpredictable range, from Marsden Hartley-like portraiture to a triptych featuring rows of cartoon jaguars and Eastern temples cut out of copper sheets.</p>
        <p>Her paintings have the bright, clear look of much abstraction as well as Pop Art of the 60's. Modernist purity or ironic cool were not for her, though.</p>
        <p>Painting in glossy enamel paint with willful insouciance, she made pictures about her dogs and cats, her involvement with marathon swimming, her several husbands and her worldwide travels. Her flat-footed style suggests that of a self-taught artist, but her pictures don't have the visionary or obsessive weirdness associated with outsider art.</p>
        <p>Still, they are often curiously idiosyncratic.</p>
        <p>''Woman and Dog With Chinese Rug'' is like a funky Alex Katz. Every piece of the picture is flat and crisply defined: the stylized clouds on the blue and white rug; the woman's red, high-heeled shoes and her green, polka-dotted dress; the black thronelike chair on which she sits holding a rigid white dog. Mysteriously, a massive ram's horn is displayed on a nearby stand and the woman has a clownish, toothy grin plastered across her face. We don't know what she's laughing at, but her smile seems to embody Brown's mischievous relationship to the conventional esthetic wisdom of her time.</p>
