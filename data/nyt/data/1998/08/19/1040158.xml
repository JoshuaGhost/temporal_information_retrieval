        <p>Oregon officials announced today that eight people in the state had died after taking lethal medications prescribed under the law allowing doctor-assisted suicide for terminally ill people, which took effect last November.</p>
        <p>Two other people who were certified as terminally ill and who had received state authorization to take the drugs died before doing so, according to a report released by the Oregon Health Division.</p>
        <p>The state law, officially known as the Death with Dignity Act, is the only one in the nation allowing doctor-assisted suicide. While advocates for the practice view the law as a potential bellwether for other states that have considered similar measures, opponents have fiercely criticized the Oregon law and fought -- so far successfully -- against its adoption elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Today's report, the first to detail deaths under the law, was described as a ''tragic development'' by a spokesman for the state's Catholic Conference, but supporters said the relatively small number of deaths disproved predictions by Roman Catholic leaders and other opponents that the law would be abused or that sick people would flock to their doctors to end their lives.</p>
        <p>The Oregon law applies to an adult of sound mind who has, in the opinion of two doctors, less than six months to live. Doctors may prescribe but not administer the lethal dose. Those wishing to die fill out and sign a single-page form, titled, ''Request for medication to end my life in a humane and dignified manner.''</p>
        <p>While no names of the 10 deceased people were included in today's report, the report included statistics that offered a stark glimpse into legally assisted suicide, including these:</p>
        <p>*Five were men and five were women.</p>
        <p>*Cancer was the underlying illness in 9 of the 10 cases, while the 10th person suffered from heart disease.</p>
        <p>*The average age at death was 71.</p>
        <p>*All received a medical evaluation by at least two doctors to confirm their terminal condition, and their doctors judged each to be capable of making and communicating health-care decisions, as required by the law. All complied with the 15-day waiting period between the first and second requests for the lethal drugs.</p>
        <p>*Eight of the 10 had more than a high-school education.</p>
        <p>*Of the eight who actually took lethal medication, the wait between acquiring the prescription and death ranged from less than a day to 16 days. The average wait was two days.</p>
        <p>*The eight who who took the drugs died within seven hours of doing so; the average time before death was 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>The Oregon Health Division said today that it was conducting in-depth interviews with the doctors involved in assisting or attending the suicides, and that a more extensive report covering all cases under the Death with Dignity Act would be made public early next year.</p>
        <p>''We are releasing this preliminary summary to inform the public and those concerned about ethical, legal and medical aspects of the act,'' said Dr. Katrina Hedberg, medical epidemiologist for the division. But the law had confidentiality provisions that explicitly prohibited the state from releasing many other details of the suicides, she added.</p>
        <p>''Release of more specific information at this time would jeopardize this guarantee of protection,'' Dr. Hedberg said.</p>
        <p>The Oregon law was originally approved, 51 percent to 49 percent, in a 1994 vote by state residents, but was promptly put on hold by a series of court battles. The fight seemed to have been settled last year, when Oregon voters, this time by a margin of 60 percent to 40 percent, turned back a measure to repeal the law.</p>
        <p>A new wrinkle quickly developed when Federal drug-enforcement officials threatened to impose severe sanctions on any doctor who prescribed suicide drugs, the Oregon law notwithstanding. Attorney General Janet Reno removed that obstacle in June, effectively overruling the drug officials by declaring that no such prosecutions would take place.</p>
