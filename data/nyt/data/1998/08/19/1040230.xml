        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am troubled by suggestions that the President is the moral leader of the country (front page, Aug. 18). The office of the President provides political leadership and governs. Nowhere in the Constitution is the President given moral power.</p>
        <p>In our system we hold that no one is above the law, including the President. The laws, despite differences of judicial opinion, are written in black and white. Moral preference is personal; it differs in all of us. An example is the abortion debate, in which some hold that the law is immoral.  How would we hold accountable a future President who believed that abortion is morally wrong? Present political leaders who oppose abortion are expected to uphold the law.</p>

        <p>The judgment of this Presidency must be a political one, in which the electorate's personal views on the officeholder have always been valid.</p>
