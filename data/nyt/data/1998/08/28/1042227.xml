        <p>One day after a judge ruled that the Million Youth March could proceed next weekend in Harlem, the chief organizer attacked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for trying to block the event, calling him ''an ordinary cracker'' who ''chose to ignore the law.''</p>
        <p>In a speech before reporters and about 20 supporters of the march, the organizer, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, said he wanted young black people who attend to be courteous and respectful. He said that above all, the march would be a show of ''love and unity among black people.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Muhammad took every opportunity during his 30-minute speech to bait Mr. Giuliani, who has condemned him in recent weeks for making numerous anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks.</p>
        <p>''There's no need to be afraid of Rudy Giuliani any longer,'' Mr. Muhammad said, speaking at Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem. ''This cracker knows the law, but he chose to ignore the law.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was uncharacteristically silent after the speech, refusing to discuss it during an afternoon news conference at City Hall. But the city pressed on yesterday in its battle to stop the march, asking the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn the decision that Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court made on Wednesday. A panel of three judges will hear arguments in the case on Tuesday, said Florence Hutner, an assistant corporation counsel for the city.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the city rejected Mr. Muhammad's request for a permit to hold the march in Harlem on Saturday, Sept. 5, saying the neighborhood could not safely accommodate the thousands of people expected to attend. The conflict between the city and the organizers has since become increasingly bitter, with each side accusing the other of racism and the organizers finally suing the city last week.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the march organizers argued in court that the city's refusal to grant them a permit was unconstitutional, and Judge Kaplan agreed. In his ruling, he said the city's rules for weighing permits for street events were too broad and its decisions too arbitrary. He said that the city had considered Mr. Muhammad's application ''on an ad-hoc basis'' and that the city was not ''free to impose a ban like this without a persuasive showing'' that the event threatened public safety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad and other organizers have billed the march -- actually a stationary rally along Malcolm X Boulevard -- as an opportunity for black youth to unite and hear speeches about issues that affect them, like police brutality, racism, unemployment and drug abuse. They have invited young black people from around the country, but they now say attendance will be nowhere near the one million people originally expected.</p>
        <p>In his speech yesterday, Mr. Muhammad praised Judge Kaplan for ruling that the city's actions had violated the Constitutional rights of the march organizers. But he went on to say that he did not believe in the United States Constitution, and that it was not ''worth the paper it's printed on.''</p>
        <p>He also criticized black politicians who have expressed reservations about the march. Several black lawmakers from Harlem, including State Senator David A. Paterson and United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, have questioned why the organizers did not consult with Harlem residents before planning the event, and whether it will be safe.</p>
        <p>''Stand up, be strong again,'' Mr. Muhammad said, addressing black elected officials who have criticized the march, none of whom attended the speech. ''Stop flip-flopping on the side of the youth one day, then against them the next.''</p>
        <p>Senator Paterson issued a statement yesterday asking the march organizers to avoid making ''bigoted'' remarks about other racial and ethnic groups at the event and to focus instead on the problems facing black youth.</p>
        <p>''I don't want it to be a contest to see who can make the most inflammatory statement in the most creative way,'' Mr. Paterson said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Muhammad shrugged off the request, saying after his speech that he could not make such a guarantee. ''How are we going to prepare our youth,'' he said, ''if we don't tell our youth who are our oppressors?''</p>
        <p>In one of his attacks on Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Muhammad said the Mayor ''never would've told Jewish youth in Crown Heights they couldn't march.''</p>
        <p>''He never would've said it to Jew mothers, or Jew youth,'' Mr. Muhammad said. ''He never even would've tried it.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Giuliani would not respond to the speech, he did speak out against the march earlier in the day, at a news conference in the Bronx. ''For the life of me, I can't figure out why people would voluntarily join a hate march,'' the Mayor said. ''The person running this march has said the most hateful things that I have heard in this city in maybe a couple of decades.''</p>
        <p>At the same news conference, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the march would severely strain police resources, since it falls on the busy Labor Day weekend. The West Indian Day Parade alone, scheduled to take place in Brooklyn on Labor Day, will require the supervision of at least 3,000 officers, he said. Mr. Safir said that the Police Department had started planning for the march, but that he did not yet know how many officers would be needed.</p>
        <p>Because many officers are on vacation that weekend, it will be difficult to find enough to cover two major events, even though they are on different days, he said.</p>
        <p>''If we're forced to deal with the march, we'll deal with it,'' Mr. Safir said. ''But we're going to have to bring in all hands. We're going to have to bring in people who are off on overtime, and it's going to be a great cost to the city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad issued a warning to the Mayor and the police force in his speech, saying violence could erupt if police officers mistreat anyone at the rally. ''We could have one fool on the police force who could ignite the collapse of New York City,'' he said. ''Mayor Giuliani, make sure you have no riots by police officers that day, because it could be catastrophic for the city.''</p>
        <p>But he also urged young people planning to attend the march to be ''slow to anger, and not that quick to judge.''</p>
        <p>''If someone steps on your toe, apologize to him first,'' Mr. Muhammad said. ''Keep smiles on our faces. Hug each other with tight embraces. Let's have a day of networking, organizing and galvanizing.''</p>
