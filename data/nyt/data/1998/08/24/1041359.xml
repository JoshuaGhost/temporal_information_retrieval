        <p>In the movie business, the ''suits'' are the studio executives who visit the set in business attire; producers come on set in jeans or khakis, with their sleeves rolled up.</p>
        <p>Tracey Trench is new enough to the producer's job to still have a collection of suits, a holdover from her days as a director of development and production at the Fox Family Films unit of 20th Century Fox.</p>
        <p>''What kind of suit am I wearing?'' she said, repeating a reporter's question. Sitting in a cafeteria in midtown Manhattan, she looked at her gray lapels as if seeing them for the first time. Reaching into the back of her collar, she came up with the answer.</p>
        <p>''Emanuel,'' she said. Emanuel Ungaro, that is. ''I can feel the label. I've got two gray suits that look alike, but one has a smooth label and the other has a fuzzy label.''</p>
        <p>Suits are entirely relevant to the story of this movie producer, who has followed the unlikeliest of career paths to emerge as the kind of person who can be trusted to get a picture made on a tight budget.</p>
        <p>Last summer, when Fox -- a subsidiary of the News Corporation -- asked Ms. Trench, now 34, to leave her studio executive job, become an independent contractor and go to Europe as a fill-in producer on her first feature film, ''Ever After,'' she did yet not understand the dress code. ''I packed a bag, mostly of suits,'' Ms. Trench said. ''I had to call home and send for comfortable clothes.''</p>
        <p>''Ever After,'' a retelling of the Cinderella fable with Drew Barrymore as the heroine, opened to mixed reviews on July 31. (It got two thumbs-up from Siskel and Ebert, while Steven Holden of The New York Times labeled it ''a sappy costume comedy.'') But it has taken in a respectable $42.3 million so far at the box office, as estimated by Variety through yesterday, insuring that it will more than recoup the modest $24 million the film cost to make.</p>
        <p>And that makes Ms. Trench herself a heroine at Fox, because she has brought a happy ending to a movie that seemed headed for trouble, just when Fox needed it least. Last summer the studio was committed to bankrolling, along with Paramount, a $200 million bet on the not-yet-released ''Titanic'' and Fox was wary of spending much on a small period fable like ''Ever After.''</p>
        <p>Shooting was already scheduled to start on the film in the Dordogne region of France, calling for hundreds of extras and thousands of elaborate costumes. But the studio now wanted to slash the $30 million budget and make significant changes in the script. And the two producers on ''Ever After'' were about to leave.</p>
        <p>''It certainly was wobbly,'' recalled Christopher Meledandri, who was then president of Fox Family Films and is now head of Fox's animation division. ''Any time you attempt to set a start date for a picture before you have a final lock-down script, preproduction becomes extremely complicated.''</p>
        <p>The two asked to fit into the producers' slippers were Timothy M. Bourne as the line producer, who would deal with financial matters, and Ms. Trench as the creative producer. ''I knew when I went over there, that if I didn't make it work I would be back in L.A. in a minute,'' Ms. Trench said.</p>
        <p>There were script changes and cuts. In addition, up until two weeks before shooting began, there were the arguments about whether Ms. Barrymore would be blond or brunette. ''Drew is a commodity, recognizable as a blond,'' Ms. Trench said. Studio executives had not paid $3 million for an actress who might end up looking like Drew Barrymore's sister, but Ms. Trench believed Cinderella needed to be a brunette.</p>
        <p>''The time of blond Cinderellas is past,'' Ms. Trench said. ''She doesn't catch the Prince's eye because she's blond, but because of what she says and does.'' And so, Drew Barrymore's Cinderella is a brunette.</p>
        <p>Even more significant, from the company's standpoint, was getting the film made for $24 million -- which included a $2 million rebate for shooting entirely within the European Union with a European crew. Anjelica Huston, who plays the evil stepmother in the movie, counted in the calculations because she holds an Irish passport. Thus was born a producer, the job title given to those who find stories to develop, raise money to make films or supervise the actual production.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meledandri says that the qualities he looks for in a producer go beyond business acumen and common sense. ''It also takes a firm grasp of storytelling,'' he said, ''a talent for working with people under the most pressured circumstances and an ability to maintain a very clear overview of the film at all times, no matter how grand a momentary crisis the movie is in. She had all of those qualities.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Trench also had an eclectic resume. A star high school basketball player in Terre Haute, Ind., who was one of five children of two schoolteachers, she went to Harvard. There she received a degree in social anthropology after writing a thesis on artisan bread baking in Paris.</p>
        <p>After working briefly as a consultant at A.M.I., a health care consulting firm in Miami, Ms. Trench landed in Beijing where she tutored English at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute and learned Mandarin. Her subsequent decision to go to business school was inspired in part, she said, by her inability to make ''heads or tails'' of the English-language Asian Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>It was between her first and second years of business school at the University of California at Los Angeles that she encountered the movie business. She got a freelance job at the Creative Artists Agency, which represents some of Hollywood's biggest names, conducting research for the director Alan Parker. A New York Times Magazine photo essay they saw on Japanese internment camps during World War II led to Mr. Parker's 1990 film ''Come See the Paradise,'' on which Ms. Trench was credited as a researcher.</p>
        <p>After she had spent three years working as a ''development girl'' for other producers, Mr. Meledandri hired her to be a creative executive, an entry-level job, at Fox Family Films in 1994. It was ''because of all of her life experience, not her film experience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While she was a Fox executive, supervising the studio's interests in the children's movie ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'' (''A bit of a non sequitur there in my career,'' she said), Ms. Trench produced a film of her own. It was a 1997 documentary about Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot issue that passed but is still tied up in the courts, which barred illegal immigrants from California public services, including schools.</p>
        <p>The documentary, ''Fear and Learning at Hoover Elementary,'' which cost $150,000, won the Freedom of Expression award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Having been broadcast on the PBS series ''Point of View,'' the film was recently nominated for an Emmy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trench made the documentary with a friend, Laura Angelica Simon, who was a teacher at Hoover Elementary. Ms. Simon said she had only ''micro-intentions'' for the film, but Ms. Trench had a larger vision, as well as the stamina to make a documentary in her spare time. ''She would get up at five in the morning to cook breakfast for the crew,'' Ms. Simon said. The two women jointly financed the film from their savings.</p>
        <p>It was Ms. Trench's work on ''Fear and Learning at Hoover Elementary'' that convinced Mr. Meledandri to offer her the job on ''Ever After.''</p>
        <p>''That documentary involved very careful handling of people, often trying to get people to do things for no money,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Having completed production on ''Ever After'' at the end of last year, Ms. Trench jumped in on a film in preproduction -- again as an independent contractor, this time for the Walt Disney company. The movie, ''I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' budgeted in the low-$20-million range, is due in theaters this fall.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Trench has not yet done what for any producer is the main event: getting her own feature film released, based on a script she herself has developed. Toward that end, she is now developing two films for Fox's Fox 2000 film division: ''Drumline,'' about a black transfer student and a mixed-race marching band in Atlanta, and ''Papi Chulo,'' about a Hispanic man who is three-timing women in Miami, New York and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The films incorporate Ms. Trench's favorite themes -- unusual cultures and the outsider adapting to unfamiliar terrain. Stories, in other words, not unlike her own.</p>
