        <p>Three weeks after a construction scaffold collapsed, raining debris on 43d Street, killing one woman and forcing hundreds of people from their homes and businesses, some semblance of normality has been restored to Times Square. The glitter has returned to most Broadway theaters, street-corner peddlers are back, and the crush of traffic can once again be felt for miles.</p>
        <p>But 274 residents of the Woodstock Hotel -- many of them elderly, frail, mentally ill and formerly homeless -- still cannot go home because their building, badly damaged in the accident, has not been deemed safe.</p>
        <p>Though the city allowed hotel workers to search apartments on Tuesday for important belongings like eyeglasses and identification cards, some residents say they still lack essential things.</p>
        <p>Robert Little needs the dentures he left sitting in a cup in the bathroom of his tiny apartment. Gladys Lejuez needs the comfort of home, period. Alvin Romans wants to gaze on the photograph of his mother that is framed in a grandfather clock that chimes every hour. And Margaret Lawson, 60, needs her Medicaid card so she can go to the doctor to have a heart problem monitored.</p>
        <p>The accident has thrust many Woodstock residents back into a life they thought they had long abandoned, forcing them to live out of plastic bags in sterile hotel rooms. The residents are spread out along Manhattan's West Side, and their temporary homes include the Washington Jefferson Hotel in midtown, the McBurney YMCA in Chelsea and The Times Square. The displacement has disrupted the routines of people who can little afford such disruptions.</p>
        <p>It could be as long as three months before they can go home, said Cynthia Dial, executive director of Project Find, a private nonprofit social service agency that runs the 12-story Woodstock Hotel.</p>
        <p>The stretch of 43d Street between Times Square and Avenue of the Americas, home to the Woodstock and the Kit Kat Klub, location of the hit Broadway musical ''Cabaret,'' might reopen on Aug. 20, said Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management. But even that is not certain.</p>
        <p>''The demolition process necessary for the reopening of the street is a delicate process that could be slowed by inclement weather,'' Ms. Mindel said. ''But we are hopeful.''</p>
        <p>The accident at the Conde Nast building has financially drained Project Find, even though the Red Cross is paying to house the residents at seven buildings around the city. Project Find is trying to raise $350,000 to help pay for clothing, meals and transportation costs for the tenants and for overtime pay for staff members during the displacement, Ms. Dial said.</p>
        <p>But residents not only are in shock over being forced out of their homes; they also are mourning the death of a friend. Thereza Feliconio, 85, who lived at the Woodstock, was killed when chunks of steel from the Conde Nast construction site crashed into her room.</p>
        <p>''I knew her,'' said James Mills, 69, who has lived at the Woodstock for two and a half years. ''I'm thinking about going back to my hometown, Albany. This is getting to be too much.''</p>
        <p>Some residents complain angrily that they have been ignored by the city, saying that more noise was made about pets trapped in apartments. They say that Liberty Mutual Group -- the insurance company for the Durst Organization, the developer of the Conde Nast building -- and Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction manager for the building, quibble over every little detail, making their lives difficult.</p>
        <p>''This city has its priorities all screwed up,'' said Mr. Little, a barrel-chested 69-year-old. ''They forgot about us. I turn on the news and all I hear about is how some people are worried about their pets. Now, I like pets, but what about me? I don't have any teeth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Little, tired of living on food he does not have to chew, is among 90 Woodstock residents staying at the Washington Jefferson Hotel. On Wednesday evening, many of them milled about the worn wood-paneled corridors of the hotel, asking one another whether they had heard any news about when they could go home.</p>
        <p>Most of the tenants are hard-bitten New York City characters, shaped by harsh lives in the city. Many of the tenants are infirm and barely able to walk without canes, and are unable to live on their own without assistance. But some of them once were singers or actors. Others describe themselves as former ''Bowery bums.''</p>
        <p>''Everything I owned, I left behind,'' said Ms. Lejuez, who declined to reveal her age, saying only that she was over 30. ''I walked out in a flowered nightgown that I threw a blouse over and my pocketbook.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lejuez, a white-haired former cabaret and radio singer who was dressed in a brown sleeveless shirt and a rust-colored pleated skirt on Wednesday, had trouble admitting that she had ever been homeless, and she glided over the question like a skater over ice.</p>
        <p>She keeps her donated shoes and clothes in bags on top of two chairs because she does not use hotel bureaus, she said, noting that she had not had time to clean the drawers.</p>
        <p>''This has been hard for me,'' she said, smiling through ill-fitting dentures. ''I need my things. I even left my lipstick, which I had to replace.''</p>
        <p>Clyde Burton, 86, whose easygoing Southern manner made him seem out of place amid the hustle of the lobby of the Washington Jefferson Hotel, sat clutching a plastic bag of asthma medication and blood pressure pills. Mr. Burton has lived at the Woodstock for nine years. A Lower East Side residential center for the elderly is named after him because of his work as a volunteer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for 20 years, and said he used to panhandle on the streets of the Lower East Side. He believes the scaffolding accident is payback for the life he threw away when he was a Bowery bum.</p>
        <p>His voice cracked and trailed off when he said he was afraid of losing his apartment. He was concerned about the delicate china that had been given to him as a gift.</p>
        <p>''With my past, you feel terrible,'' he said. ''I'm reaping what I sowed. It's just hard luck, but God doesn't put no more on you than you can bear. What can you do when you've lost everything you have? This reminds me of the days when I didn't have nothing, when I was wrecking myself. It's a terrible feeling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romans, 69, also believes that the scaffolding accident was a sign of his past catching up with him. He said he did time in prison and slept on the streets of the Bowery, begging for change to buy a pint of white port before finding religion in 1974.</p>
        <p>''When I get down, I think about the life I used to lead,'' he said. ''I don't have the comfort of my little apartment at the Woodstock, but I'm not a drinking man. What I'm hoping and praying is that I can go back and that it's not gone. It's all I have.''</p>
