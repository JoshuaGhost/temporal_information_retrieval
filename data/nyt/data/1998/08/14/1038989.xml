        <p>The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York announced yesterday that it had selected a 29,826-square-foot building at 30 Montgomery Street in Jersey City as the new site of its operations center, currently housed at Corporate Place South in Piscataway, N.J.</p>
        <p>The bank will occupy the entire third floor and mezzanine level of the building, which is being fully renovated by its owner, the Denholtz Development Company. The functions operating from the Jersey City office will be the bank's collateral operations, demand and disbursement services, information systems, audit and administrative services. The new space will also be used as backup offices. About 60 Home Loan Bank employees will be based in the new offices by October.</p>
