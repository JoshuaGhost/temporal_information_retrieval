        <p>Vernon Dahmer Jr. covered his face and wept into his hands. His brother, Dennis, gently pounded a railing in the old courthouse balcony. And their mother, the elderly Ellie Dahmer, bowed her head and thanked God for the jury's verdict that, almost 33 years after the crime, found an old, stooped Klansman guilty of ordering her husband killed.</p>
        <p>A jury of six blacks, five whites and one Asian-American convicted Sam H. Bowers, a former Imperial Wizard of the Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, of murder in the Jan. 10, 1966, firebombing that mortally injured Vernon Dahmer Sr., who had been marked for death because he used his rural store during the 1960's as a place to register fellow blacks to vote.</p>
        <p>Judge Richard McKenzie immediately sentenced Mr. Bowers, now 73, to life in prison and slammed down his gavel to close the courtroom as an old black woman in the back row of the courtroom clapped her hands, twice, in a celebration that had been on hold for three decades.</p>
        <p>It was more than justice for the Dahmer family, who have been frustrated by mistrials in four previous trials, including two state murder trials in the 1960's from which Mr. Bowers strolled free after all-white juries deadlocked.</p>
        <p>It proved, Vernon Dahmer Jr. said, that the society Mr. Dahmer died to create is alive here in south-central Mississippi.</p>
        <p>''That's what my dad's life was about,'' he said, motioning to the jury box that had seated a racially diverse cross section of the community, not the all-white, all-male jury that had traditionally denied justice to blacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dahmer Sr., a storekeeper, farmer and local official with the N.A.A.C.P., was singled out by the Klan because he allowed his store to be used as a place for blacks to pay the $2 poll tax that was required for voter registration.</p>
        <p>Juries were selected from voting lists, and the Klan did everything in its power, from cross burnings to whippings, from church burnings to murder, to thwart the power that a vote could bring.</p>
        <p>Klan members knew, Mr. Dahmer Jr. said, that their world could only exist if blacks could be held back from using their numbers to elect change and to fill jury boxes and public offices with people of color.</p>
        <p>''He was working to make sure this day would come,'' Mr. Dahmer Jr. said.</p>
        <p>''This,'' he said of the diverse jury, ''represents America. This represents our community. The system has now worked for us.''</p>
        <p>As a young man of the Dahmer family moved through the crowded courtroom, an older white man gripped his arm.</p>
        <p>''You saw history here, son,'' the older man said.</p>
        <p>The case was history-making, for several reasons. It was only the second high-profile case in the past few years in which a white supremacist was convicted of killing a civil rights leader -- Byron De La Beckwith was convicted in 1994 in Jackson, Miss., of the 1963 murder of Medgar Evers -- but this case was different.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckwith, a onetime salesman who had been a virtual nobody in the ranks of white supremacists, murdered a nationally recognized figure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dahmer had not been nationally known. He was just a merchant and farmer in Forrest County, outside Hattiesburg. But Mr. Bowers, a businessman in Laurel, Miss., was a powerful Klan figure, the only Klansman who had the authority to order a man's death, former Klan members testified in the trial this week.</p>
        <p>Most of the people who have been convicted in civil rights-related killings have been foot soldiers, the ones who actually threw the bombs, not the leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowers, whose organization was tied to church burnings, murders and other terrorism throughout the 1960's, has served only six years, and that was for his role in the killings of Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney, the infamous Neshoba County murders. That was a Federal conviction. No Mississippi jury, he once bragged to one Klansman, would convict a white man of killing a black man.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowers, who had shown little emotion during the trial and showed none at the verdict, answered ''no'' when the judge asked whether he had anything to say before sentencing. But when his defense lawyer, Travis Buckley, asked the judge to poll the jury, Mr. Bowers turned to face them, as they said ''guilty'' one by one.</p>
        <p>Once, that look might have struck fear in people who lived at the mercy of Klan night riders, but here today, it was just an old man watching time catch up with him.</p>
        <p>''Before the jury came out, he started emptying his pockets, took off his watch in anticipation of what was going to happen,'' said Lindsay Carter, the Forrest County District Attorney. Prisoners are not allowed to take such things inside Parchman Prison, where he will be held.</p>
        <p>''I think he knew what was coming,'' Mr. Carter said.</p>
        <p>In the winter of 1965, Jones County, north of Hattiesburg, was regarded as one of the meanest in Mississippi for Klan activity. It was Mr. Bowers's base of operations.</p>
        <p>In a farmhouse just to the south, outside Hattiesburg, Mr. Bowers summoned Klan members in the months before Mr. Dahmer's murder and asked them why ''something hadn't been done'' about Mr. Dahmer, the former Klansmen testified. Mr. Bowers planned Mr. Dahmer's death, and on a cold January night sent two carloads of Klansmen south with 12 gallons of gasoline and shotguns. One way or the other, Vernon Dahmer Sr. was a dead man.</p>
        <p>The men hurled the gallons of gasoline into the house, where Mr. Dahmer Sr., his wife and three of his children slept.</p>
        <p>He was burned so badly that the skin came loose from his arms, but even while his body was in flames, he fired his shotgun over and over at the shapes darting through his yard, giving his wife and children time to escape through the back of the house.</p>
        <p>A former Klansman turned government informant who took part in that raid, Billy Roy Pitts, testified in this trial that he heard a man ''cry out in distress'' from inside the burning house.</p>
        <p>In his closing argument, Robert Helfrich, the prosecutor who handled the case, evoked that image for the jury. ''A man's voice in distress,'' Mr. Helfrich said. ''And, yes, he was a man. A man's voice is still in distress, because Sam Bowers is still walking the street.</p>
        <p>''Justice delayed,'' he added, ''is not justice denied.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dahmer was still standing that night as the Klansmen rumbled away. But his lungs were so badly seared by the flames that he died in a hospital bed 12 hours later, in his wife's arms.</p>
        <p>''These tears that I am shedding, I am shedding for Vernon,'' Mrs. Dahmer said, standing later in the hot sun outside the courthouse.</p>
        <p>A daughter, Bettie, who was 10 years old when she was handed out of a window from her father to her mother, already burned on her arms and forehead, said after the verdict that she was not able to talk. She stood with tears in her eyes as her brothers thanked prosecutors for bringing Mr. Bowers back to court.</p>
        <p>Citing new evidence, and under renewed pressure by the Dahmer family and others to reopen the case, prosecutors here -- backed by the State Attorney General, Mike Moore -- dusted off an old indictment of Mr. Bowers and two other Klansmen, Deavours Nix and Charles Noble.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nix testified as a defense witness on Thursday that he had never heard Mr. Bowers use a racial slur, let alone order a killing, and that the Klan was not a violent organization. He said he joined because he had heard the Klan was a benevolent organization that passed out fruit baskets to the poor at Christmas.</p>
        <p>He is charged with arson and Mr. Noble is charged with murder and arson in the Dahmer case. They are expected to go to trial later this year.</p>
        <p>Efforts by Mr. Bowers's lawyer, Travis Buckley -- Mr. Pitts had testified earlier that Mr. Buckley had once attended Klan meetings himself -- to paint a picture of a government conspiracy against Mr. Bowers apparently fell flat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley said his client was sacrificed to the political ambitions of Mr. Moore and compared his client's prosecution to Hitler's persecution of the Jews.</p>
        <p>But his witnesses did little to refute witnesses who painted a more ominous picture of Mr. Bowers.</p>
        <p>Two witnesses on Thursday testified that they saw a jubilant Mr. Bowers boast about the killing in the days after it. ''Look at what my boys did to that Dahmer,'' Mr. Bowers said, testified a former Klansman, Robert Earl Wilson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowers, Mr. Wilson said, was holding up a newspaper at the time with the story of Mr. Dahmer's death on the page.</p>
