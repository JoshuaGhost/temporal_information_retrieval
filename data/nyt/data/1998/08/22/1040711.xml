        <p>The American bombings in Afghanistan and the Sudan did not come up at all during juma -- traditional Friday prayers -- at Masjid Alfalah, a mosque in Corona, Queens, that is attended by Muslims from many nations. But afterward, it was clear they were on everyone's minds.</p>
        <p>And the feeling among the immigrant worshipers was almost universal: the attacks launched by their adopted country were cruel and very plainly wrong.</p>
        <p>Some called the United States Government a bully in the schoolyard of international relations, eager to show off its power and anxious to beat up helpless developing nations. Others pointedly criticized President Clinton for singling out the Islamic world while turning a blind eye to injustices against Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia. Still others said they suspected that the President authorized the bombings to divert attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p>
        <p>''To do what Clinton did, he had to have no feelings,'' said Isslam Hadidy, 21, an immigrant from Egypt. ''Innocent lives were lost and the only reason all this happened is because they couldn't control those two countries.'' Mr. Hadidy, an American citizen, was steadfast in his assessment that his adopted country had sinned against the Muslim world and somehow, someday, would pay for its arrogance. ''We believe, as Muslims, that injustice will never prevail,'' he said. ''And what happened here, this was not justice.''</p>
        <p>Ashad Mohammed, 25, a business student at St. John's University from Sri Lanka, agreed. ''They're taking a big risk,'' he said of American officials. ''Because they haven't targeted terrorists, but innocent people,  and this isn't going to finish it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohammed said he had nothing against America, particularly since he had been granted a visa allowing him to study business administration here and learn skills that will help him when he returns to his homeland.</p>
        <p>''They give people from other countries opportunities like that, but they should treat the international situation in the same way, and policies should be equal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohammed said that at the core of the anger that many Muslims feel for the United States was its continuing support for Israel. ''They target the Islamic world, but why haven't they taken any steps against the Israelis for all the hardships they have forced on Arabs?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mahamed Ismail, 65, an immigrant from India who has lived in the New York region for almost 50 years, said the Alfalah mosque was a decidedly apolitical place. ''They don't discuss politics there,'' he said. ''You just pray to Allah, and Allah will take care of the rest.''</p>
        <p>But despite his protestations that he didn't know anything about ''this bomb business,'' Mr. Ismail let slip a hint of anger at President Clinton's actions. ''What he did might be wrong or it might be right,'' he said. ''But if they're looking out for American interests, they should think before they kill innocent people who know nothing about politics.''</p>
        <p>At least one of the hundreds of worshipers who gathered outside the mosque to retrieve the shoes they had shed before kneeling for prayers wholeheartedly supported the bombings. ''To strike back and control them is the right step,'' said Aziz A. Bhatti, a Pakistani immigrant who runs a film developing shop in Jackson Heights. ''They have their own selfish motives, and they don't represent everybody in the Muslim world.''</p>
