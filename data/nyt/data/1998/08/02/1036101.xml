        <p>To the Editor: Readers of William Weaver's informative article about Loreto, ''On Wings of Angels'' (July 5), might want to know about works of art in Loreto that my husband and I found of much greater interest than those described in the article.</p>
        <p>The basilica has magnificent bronze doors carved with scenes from the Old and New Testaments in the late 16th century. Its interior is breathtaking in its simple spaciousness, the vaults defined by soft blue stone, the square white columns topped by blue and gold leaves.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Readers of William Weaver's informative article about Loreto, ''On Wings of Angels'' (July 5), might want to know about works of art in Loreto that my husband and I found of much greater interest than those described in the article.</p>
        <p>The basilica has magnificent bronze doors carved with scenes from the Old and New Testaments in the late 16th century. Its interior is breathtaking in its simple spaciousness, the vaults defined by soft blue stone, the square white columns topped by blue and gold leaves.</p>
        <p>Everything draws your eye to the marble casing that surrounds the Santa Casa, which occupies the space usually taken by an altar. Statues by Sansovino, Sangallo and others lean out of their niches in the marble casing with power and emotional intensity.</p>
        <p>The magnetism of the Santa Casa is its association not only with the birth of Mary and the youth of Jesus but especially with the Annunciation. Pilgrims believe the humble room is the place God chose to become deeply intimate with humankind. Even nonbelievers can be profoundly moved when the priest tells the story of the angel's announcement and asks Mary's question, ''How is it possible?''</p>
