        <p>To the Editor: Your article, ''Boarding Passes Becoming Relics'' (Practical Traveler, June 21) reminded me of an episode on the way to Nairobi a few years ago.</p>
        <p>By mistake, we were assigned to the same seats as another couple on a Pan Am flight. Before takeoff a flight attendant found us two other seats but neglected to give us boarding passes for leaving and re-embarking in Liberia, on the way.</p>
        <p>The attendant said that he could not find additional passes. But he gave us a paper with his signature and assured us that this was all that was necessary. In Monrovia, we spent an hour in the airport, then attempted to re-enter. An armed guard refused to allow us aboard.</p>
        <p>Another flight attendant exited the plane, looked at the signed paper and said that he did not recognize the name, possibly because the flight crew had been changed. At our urgent request, he found our safari group leader on the plane who managed us to get back on board.</p>
        <p>After this experience, our safari was tame.</p>
