        <p>Having grown no fonder of the track surface at Saratoga in the course of a year, Jersey Girl relied on her heart, her class and her courage to carry her to her seventh consecutive victory today in the $200,000 Test.</p>
        <p>Spotting 10 rivals from 3 to 9 pounds, Jersey Girl struggled early as she ran ninth down the backside behind the pace-setters, Storm Beauty, Liable and the highly regarded Brulay.</p>

        <p>Having grown no fonder of the track surface at Saratoga in the course of a year, Jersey Girl relied on her heart, her class and her courage to carry her to her seventh consecutive victory today in the $200,000 Test.</p>
        <p>Spotting 10 rivals from 3 to 9 pounds, Jersey Girl struggled early as she ran ninth down the backside behind the pace-setters, Storm Beauty, Liable and the highly regarded Brulay.</p>
        <p>Heading into the turn, however, with Brulay tiring after fractions of 21 3/5 seconds and 44 2/5 while running three wide, Jersey Girl began accelerating and swept widest of all into the stretch. At the top of the lane she took command and drew clear, hitting the wire in 1 minute 23 seconds to beat Brave Deed by a length and remain undefeated in 1998.</p>
        <p>''She had trouble with the track, but she kept trying and trying, and she never threw in the towel,'' said Mike Smith, who was also aboard the filly when she was beaten 17 lengths in last year's Schuylerville in her only other start here. ''I think it shows she has tremendous heart. For her to keep running like that was tremendous.''</p>
        <p>Her trainer, Todd Pletcher, said: ''She spotted weight, lost ground, was wide every step -- yet she does nothing but win. Her ability to handle the track was a concern because she ran the only bad race of her life here, but once she made that explosive move on the turn like she can, I wasn't worried anymore.''</p>
        <p>Jersey Girl, who took two-thirds of the Triple Tiara with victories in the Acorn and the Mother Goose at Belmont, was held out of the final leg, the mile-and-a-half Coaching Club American Oaks, in favor of the Grade I Test. Pletcher said he was tempted by the chance to join eight other winners of the series but stuck with his original instincts.</p>
        <p>''I told myself to make a decision and live with it,'' Pletcher said. ''I  felt it was the right decision before the race, and I feel like it's the right  decision after the race.''</p>
        <p>He said Jersey Girl will make her next start in the Gazelle at Belmont on Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>The even-money favorite of the crowd of 27,734, Jersey Girl, who carried 123 pounds, returned $4.30 for a $2 bet to win as she extended her bankroll to $571,136 for Robert and Lee Ackerley.</p>
        <p>''It's not up to me to decide the championship, but if they voted today, it would be a no-brainer,'' Pletcher said. ''Another filly would have to do something spectacular, like win the Breeders' Cup Classic, for that to happen.''</p>
        <p>Said the trainer John Kimmel, whose Cantica was third: ''I think in Jersey Girl you're looking at the 3-year-old champion.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Saturday's total handle of $17,120,234 was a Saratoga record for a card outside the day of the Travers, beating the handle of $17,113,575 last year on the day of the Whitney. Escena, 4-2-0 this year, heads the field for Sunday's $250,000 Go for Wand Stakes. . . . Rashas Warning and Naskra's Delight carry top weight of  121 pounds in their respective divisions of Monday's $75,000 Grade III Lake George on the turf. . . . Tale of the Cat arrived at Saratoga on Friday night and will go for his first Grade I victory in next Saturday's Whitney. . . . Favorite Trick will make his next start in next Sunday's $250,000 Jim Dandy.</p>
