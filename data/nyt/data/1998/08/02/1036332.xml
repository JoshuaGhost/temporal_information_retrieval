        <p>Orchard Beach in the Bronx was reopened to swimmers yesterday after Parks Department officials determined that the water had not been contaminated by a sewage leak in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>City parks officials had closed the beach on Friday, a day after a ruptured main at a sewage treatment plant in Mount Vernon released partially treated sewage into Eastchester Creek and, ultimately, Eastchester Bay. Yesterday, the popular beach off Pelham Bay Park reopened at midday, and thousands of sunbathers returned to the water.</p>
        <p>Edward Skyler, a Parks Department spokesman, said the beach reopened at 12:30 P.M., a great relief since an estimated 5,000 people had come out to enjoy the sunny day. ''This is our season, so we want to be able to open every beach, every day,'' Mr. Skyler said.</p>
        <p>The Friday closing was a precaution to protect swimmers against potential health risks. Officials worried that swimmers might ingest fecal matter, risking gastrointestinal infections, hepatitis and other illnesses. The greatest concern was the possible presence of coliform, a potentially dangerous pathogen.</p>
        <p>Water samples taken Friday by Department of Environmental Protection technicians were evaluated yesterday morning by the City Health Department. ''The coliform levels were well below the standard for safe water,'' said Sandra Mullin, a Health Department spokeswoman. ''We've decided that the water is safe to swim in this weekend.''</p>
        <p>Westchester County sewage workers were scheduled to finish repairs last night after a new joint for the damaged sewer main arrived at Newark International Airport early in the morning.</p>
        <p>At Orchard Beach, parks officials hurried to insure that enough lifeguards were on duty to reopen yesterday. In the morning, with the waters still off limits, people sunbathed beneath the red warning flag.</p>
        <p>''People generally understand that it was closed to protect their own health and not through any fault of ours,'' Mr. Skyler said.</p>
        <p>Caryn Cosgrove, 33, arrived early yesterday morning with her husband, Tom, and their son, Thomas. ''Our son is very disappointed,'' Mrs. Cosgrove said before swimmers were allowed back in the water. ''He keeps asking to go in. He asks us if the water is disgusting. We tell him the water is dirty. We don't want to discourage him for next time.''</p>
        <p>Rose White, a resident of the Bronx, brought five children and one grandchild, ages 1 to 5, to let them play in the sand. ''When the water is ready,'' she said, ''we'll let them go in. Until then, safety comes first.''</p>
        <p>Frank Sabatino, 51, a retired police detective and a beach regular for 40 years, shrugged off the closing. He said condoms and toilet paper sometimes wash up on the shore. ''We see stuff here all the time,'' he said. ''My rule is, if the water looks clean, I go in. If there's a lot of slime and brown stuff, I don't.''</p>
