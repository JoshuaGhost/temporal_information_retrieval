        <p>Bonnie Pressman, the wife of Gene Pressman, whose grandfather founded Barneys New York, said yesterday that she would step down as the retailer's executive vice president and director of women's fashion to become senior vice president and women's fashion director at the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation.</p>
        <p>The move is almost sure to shock many people in the fashion industry with whom Ms. Pressman has maintained good will during the retailer's bankruptcy proceedings, which began two years ago.</p>

        <p>Bonnie Pressman, the wife of Gene Pressman, whose grandfather founded Barneys New York, said yesterday that she would step down as the retailer's executive vice president and director of women's fashion to become senior vice president and women's fashion director at the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation.</p>
        <p>The move is almost sure to shock many people in the fashion industry with whom Ms. Pressman has maintained good will during the retailer's bankruptcy proceedings, which began two years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pressman, who joined the company in 1983 as a former model and retail novice, learned from her father-in-law, Fred Pressman, and rose through the ranks of the business, mastering everything from the art of buying shoes to promoting young, unheard-of designers. Fred Pressman died in 1996.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Pressman's place at Barneys, Judy Collinson, the general merchandise manager for the women's division, will take on additional responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Although Gene Pressman was recently stripped of his title as co-chief executive of the company, as part of the company's attempt to restructure and emerge from Chapter 11, Ms. Pressman said her decision to join Lauren was based on the new job's requiring less travel and allowing her more time with her two young children. ''I decided I needed to be home more with them because they need more of my support now that they are in school,'' she said.</p>
