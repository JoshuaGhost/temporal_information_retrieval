        <p>IT'S still the peak summer travel season, but airlines are looking ahead to fall with sale fares to Europe. Travelers will have to act fast for this batch: the booking deadline for most is Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>Late fall and winter travel offers the cheapest seats. For example, $418 is the lowest round-trip fare from New York to Paris being offered by Air France, AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and most other carriers for travel in September and October. That drops to $338 from Nov. 1 through Dec. 11 and Jan. 11 to March 24. Tax is extra, and travel must be on Monday through Thursday. The major drawback for business travelers, in addition to the lead time, is the Saturday-night stay required.</p>

        <p>IT'S still the peak summer travel season, but airlines are looking ahead to fall with sale fares to Europe. Travelers will have to act fast for this batch: the booking deadline for most is Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>Late fall and winter travel offers the cheapest seats. For example, $418 is the lowest round-trip fare from New York to Paris being offered by Air France, AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and most other carriers for travel in September and October. That drops to $338 from Nov. 1 through Dec. 11 and Jan. 11 to March 24. Tax is extra, and travel must be on Monday through Thursday. The major drawback for business travelers, in addition to the lead time, is the Saturday-night stay required.</p>
        <p>The lowest New York to London fare for September and October is $448 on most of the major airlines; later in the season, it goes as low as $318 on Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic and a few other carriers. For late fall and winter, fares of less than $400 round trip are also being offered on a number of other major European routes: New York to Vienna, Milan, Brussels and Amsterdam, to name a few.</p>
        <p>Airline spokesmen say the sales are just business as usual, but Samuel C. Buttrick, airline analyst for Paine Webber, saw another possible reason: increased trans-Atlantic capacity exceeds expected long-term traffic growth.</p>
        <p>Signing Once and For All</p>
        <p>Budget Rent a Car is joining the ranks of other rental companies with ''paperless'' express service. The Budget service, called Fastbreak, is being phased in over the next few weeks at major United States airports.</p>
        <p>Other rental companies, including Hertz and Avis Rent a Car, have similar programs.</p>
        <p>At Budget, enrollment is free; customers fill out a master rental agreement detailing their preferences, from collision damage waiver to type of vehicle. Then, at 25 airports (including Kennedy International, La Guardia, O'Hare International, Los Angeles International and Logan International in Boston) customers will be able to bypass the rental counter, taking the bus from the terminal to the Budget lot and picking up their cars there.</p>
        <p>At 80 additional airports, customers can stop at the counter to check their reservation status on a printout, show their driver's licenses and pick up the keys to their car.</p>
        <p>In both cases, a receipt will be printed out on the spot when the car is returned.</p>
        <p>Card With a Dividend</p>
        <p>U S Airways and Nationsbank have started a Dividend Miles Visa Platinum card that allows members to earn 1.2 miles for each dollar spent. Card members receive a 5,000-mile bonus the first time they use the card and double miles on U S Airways ticket purchases. They also get a $99 companion ticket for a trip in the continental United States each year after their anniversary date of joining, $75 off a new membership to U S Airways Clubs and a year-end account summary. The annual membership fee is $125.</p>
        <p>Their Kind of Town</p>
        <p>Chicago is the city most often visited by business travelers domestically and London is the most popular internationally, according to a recent survey of 227 corporate travel managers by Runzheimer International, the consultants in Rochester, Wis.</p>
        <p>Respondents were asked to name the 10 cities most often visited by their companies' employees traveling on business. On the domestic list, after Chicago, which was mentioned by 54 percent of respondents, other major destinations were New York, named by 44 percent; Atlanta, 41 percent; Los Angeles, 40 percent, and Dallas, 39 percent. London was cited by 54 percent of respondents, with Paris a distant second at 28 percent, followed by Toronto, Mexico City and Tokyo. Both Chicago and London also topped their respective categories the last time the survey was taken, two years ago.</p>
