        <p>Vornado Inc, real estate company that owns now-defunct Alexander's department store in New Jersey, donates huge porcelain mural by Stefan Knapp to Bergen Museum of Art and Science in Paramus (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To David Messer, director of the Bergen Museum of Art and Science in Paramus, the giant mural that has been on the now-defunct Alexander's department store at Routes 4 and 17 since 1962, ''has become the single most important icon of culture in Bergen County.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Messer said he was delighted this month when Vornado Inc., a Saddle Brook real estate company that owns the building, donated the mural, plus $53,000 to pack its porcelain panels, to the museum. The 48-by-180-foot image, in bold swaths of red, orange and blue on white, is by a Polish muralist, Stefan Knapp.</p>
        <p>Carlstadt officials will allow the mural to be stored in a municipal storage facility until museum trustees decide where to display it, Mr. Messer said. One option, he said, is the exterior of a mall proposed in Carlstadt.</p>
