        <p>While the Spanish conquistadors vanquished the Incas and Aztecs with relative ease, the Mapuche Indians of Chile staved off the invaders for generations with ferocious hit-and-run attacks. The Spanish rarely dared to cross the deep, rushing waters of the Bio-Bio River, which served as a tense barricade well into the 18th century.</p>
        <p>Today the Mapuches are a faint shadow of their mighty ancestors, but once again they are making a stand on the Bio-Bio.</p>
        <p>The Government and Endesa, a Spanish-owned electric utility, want to build a $500 million dam project on the river intended to provide more than 10 percent of Chile's electricity  by 2002. But a dozen Indian families have refused to leave their lands, which would be flooded by the dam. Their militancy has provoked demonstrations and road blockades around the country, embarrassed President Eduardo Frei and put the entire hydroelectric project in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>After years of lost Indian land battles during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the conflict has become a test for Indian minority rights in Chile's decade-old democracy, one that may take years to resolve in the courts. But the issue has also highlighted two divergent views of what the future of Indian life should be: one based on traditional ways of living, or one that favors economic development at the risk of assimilation.</p>
        <p>The debate is sharply dividing the impoverished farming and herding community of 500 Pehuenche Indians -- a subgroup in the Mapuche nation -- that sprawls below a breathtaking swath of snow-capped Andean mountains. Faced with an Endesa offer to leave their lands in exchange for a package of new land, housing, a school and credits, the holdouts are opposed by about 90 Pehuenche families who have agreed to make a deal.</p>
        <p>''It will mean a new day for us,'' said Maria Olga Galpan, 26, a goatherd who is ready to leave Ralco. ''We want to keep our traditions but this land is good for nothing. We need new schools, new houses, new opportunities.''</p>
        <p>But a minority in the community  will not budge because, they say, the 1,000-acre reservoir the 570-megawatt project would create would flood traditional burial grounds and other plots where the Pehuenches conduct their religious rituals under sacred trees. They say several herbs the Pehuenches depend on for medicine do not grow on the lands offered by the company.</p>
        <p>''I was born on this land and I want to die on this land,'' said Nicolasa Quintreman Qulpan, 59, a leader of  the Indians who oppose the project. ''How can I abandon my grandparents and great-grandparents?''</p>
        <p>The two groups accuse each other of being manipulated by outsiders, either by the Spanish electric company or by Chilean and foreign environmentalists who say the dam will upset a precious ecosystem and doom several exotic species of fish that are found nowhere else in the world. A couple of fistfights have broken out over the dam in Ralco, says one Chilean environmentalist following the issue, but mostly members of the two groups exchange frosty stares when they meet on the dirt paths that crisscross the riverside community.</p>
        <p>The struggle has taken on national proportions, including a three-day protest march this week by a few hundred Mapuche Indians from Santiago to Valparaiso, where Congress sits. At issue, Indian advocates say, is a 1992 Indian rights law that prohibits the sale of Indian lands without the unanimous consent of the community involved. The law states that only the National Indigenous Development Board, the Government bureau of Indian affairs, which has strong Indian representation on its board of directors, can authorize any land swaps.</p>
        <p>But the Government has argued that in the Ralco case an electric service law that permits expropriation of property in the interest of providing energy for the general good takes precedence over the Indian rights law.</p>
        <p>''Our demand for electric power is growing 8.4 percent every year,'' said Planning Minister German Quintana Pena in an interview. ''So we need to generate power at the lowest cost possible and that means hydroelectric power.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Quintana Pena said that without the Ralco project Chile would be forced to import more natural gas from Argentina, and that would require installing costly pipelines and building new generation plants around Santiago. Such plants, he added, would only add to the capital's already severe air pollution.</p>
        <p>In March 1997, the Government dusmissed the director of Chile's National Environmental Commission, after a commission technical review board issued a finding against the project. Soon after, the review board reversed its decision.</p>
        <p>This month, President Frei dismissed three members of the National Indigenous Development Board  when it appeared that the board  would vote against the project. The vote, which was scheduled for Aug. 6, was put off.</p>
        <p>Domingo Namuncura, who was director of the board until Mr. Frei forced his resignation last week, said he opposed the Ralco project because he believed some of the Indian families who have opted to leave were manipulated by the company.</p>
        <p>''Some can't read, and others thought they had no choice but to go,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Namuncura added that the lands the Indians have been offered were too poor to support their traditional wheat and potato crops.</p>
        <p>The national debate over their land has startled many in Ralco, who are accustomed to a quiet life well outside the hubbub of the modern world.</p>
        <p>''We are really surprised to be in the middle of this controversy,'' said Francisco Levi, a 30-year-old farmer. ''But it does not frighten us. This is the land of our forefathers and we see no reason to make a change.''</p>
