        <p>On June 14, the Jewish Museum in New York opened a retrospective of work by the sculptor George Segal that will be on view until Oct. 4. It has run concurrently with an exhibition of paintings by Chaim Soutine that closes today and then travels to Los Angeles and Cincinnati. On the day his show opened, Mr. Segal met at the museum with a group of art teachers and, after walking with them through his show, responded to questions. The following narrative, adapted from a videotape of that session made by the public-television station WNJN, illustrates how an artist develops the ideas that will shape a career.</p>
        <p>Early Influences And Intuitions</p>
        <p>In the late 40's, Helen -- my wife now for more than 50 years -- had a job for $44 a week, out of which she paid my tuition to Pratt, where I majored in art education. In 1949, I saw a painting show at New York University that overwhelmed me. Even before discovering that the style was called Abstract Expressionism, I instantly transferred to N.Y.U., where Tony Smith and William Baziotes were my teachers. Smith, still an architect, not a sculptor, came to class with a Rothko painting under his arm to show us what the new painting looked like. He urged us to see the new, postwar Italian movies by Visconti, Rossellini, et al., filmed in bombed-out Italy, dealing with a reality rarely considered by Hollywood.</p>
        <p>He asked us to read James Joyce, showed us Picasso and Braque collages, then asked us to find connections between the literature and the art. He spoke of encountering public sculpture in the cities and villages in Italy in contrast to driving from New York to Los Angeles and encountering no art in the streets. But he spoke warmly of the grand look of modern factory buildings in the United States. To help us understand the new abstract painting, he advised us to imagine we were flying over the Rockies in a plane looking down into the landscape.</p>
        <p>Baziotes urged me to throw away my small brushes and stop painting my derivative Cezannes, go to a hardware store, buy a five-inch house-painter's brush and paint abstract marks; he believed abstract gestures could contain every nuance of an artist's feelings. I was horrified. De Kooning was painting those extraordinary women, with his remarkable thick and thin paint, architectural rigor, and all the voluptuous curves and color of a Rubens painting -- and with their evil, manipulative grins. In ''She Wolf,'' Pollock was obsessed with his mixed feelings toward his mother, his admiration of Picasso, and Jung's ideas about connections between the individual unconscious and the archetypes and myths of many civilizations.</p>
        <p>Clement Greenberg's theories on modern American art as an implacable march toward pure abstraction, with all figurative reference wiped out, made little sense to me, considering the hunger in what I considered the best of Abstract Expressionism to embrace the Freudian unconscious, Surrealist process and Jungian myth. My own intuition led me to insist on a connection between physical reality and the feelings and ideas in our heads.</p>
        <p>This concern with the relationship between the visible and the invisible led me to friendships with Allan Kaprow, Lucas Samaras and Bob Whitman, then later to the Pop artists Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Marisol and Tom Wesselman. Kaprow led me to Marcel Duchamp, whose work included paintings of figures in Cubist and Italian Futurist style but also real ''ready-made'' objects like bottle racks, bicycle wheels and bottles that, magically, didn't look ordinary.</p>
        <p>Because of Kaprow, I took a John Cage class at the New School. Cage was ecstatic at the sounds of the streets coming in from the windows, at the spontaneous collage irrationality of the look of those city streets, at the Buddhist profundity of the tumbling barrage of visual sensations we get from the real world. Both Kaprow and I felt that the work of Duchamp and Cage offered an impressive conceptual base for connecting the real world with the invisible contents of our heads.</p>
        <p>In 1956 Kaprow urged me to apply for membership in the cooperative gallery to which he belonged, the Hansa, directed by Ivan Karp and Richard Bellamy, to which artists like Jan Muller, Jean Follett, Richard Stankiewicz, Wolf Kahn and Myron Stout belonged. I was elated to get into the Hansa, where, through Kaprow, I met the great art historian Meyer Schapiro. A longtime promoter of the new abstract painting (in 1937 Schapiro had proposed, without much success, that abstract art become the official art of the Soviet Union), Meyer was surprisingly sympathetic to my new impulse to couple realism with abstraction, inviting me to follow Barnett Newman to talk to his graduate art-history class at Columbia.</p>
        <p>Public Sculpture: Making Ideas Concrete</p>
        <p>The late 70's, after I had become established as an artist, was a time of a new burst of interest in public sculpture in the United States. I was reluctant to enter a competition for a Holocaust memorial sculpture in San Francisco. My father was one of seven brothers in a family in Poland, the only one annoyed enough and nervy enough to leave in 1922 after he was beaten by the Cossacks, who stole all his valuables; a week later he received a draft notice to join the Russian army. All his brothers and their families were eventually killed by the Nazis.</p>
        <p>To think of making such a sculpture would involve my immersion in death and despair for many months. Also, I'd be in competition with some of my best sculptor friends: Menashe Kadishman, Noguchi, Lawrence Halprin and Bob Graham. Bill Lowenberg, a survivor of the camps, prevailed on me to stop in San Francisco to see the site and talk to some of the other survivors in the Bay Area for whom the sculpture was critically necessary: it would serve, figuratively, as a gravestone for the many members of their families they had lost. I decided to make the sculpture whether I won or lost the competition. I did win it.</p>
        <p>In addition to my personal trepidations, I had been wrestling with an esthetic problem: what should public sculpture in a democracy look like? I was impatient with oversize victorious generals on horses, more drawn to deal with the dreams and feelings of poor immigrants, like my father. For years, I had been making sculpture of ordinary people in ordinary places, encouraging the viewer's personal interpretation. How could I make concrete the ideas that drive people and refer to the intensity of that drive? The Holocaust memorial and the F.D.R. Memorial that was installed in Washington last year are my most ambitious efforts. [The Holocaust memorial, in white bronze, shows a death-camp survivor looking out from inside a barbwire fence, with a heap of bodies behind him; the F.D.R. memorial, a grayish bronze tableau, includes an Appalachian farm couple, a Depression bread line and a fireside chat, with a single figure sitting beside a radio.]</p>
        <p>My horror of genocide includes the incalculable loss of civilized values. My F.D.R. imagery in Washington was designed to mesh with the brilliant essence of F.D.R.'s words: ''I see one third of the nation ill fed, ill clothed, ill housed,'' unmistakably announcing the President's conviction that it was the responsibility of national governments to help alleviate these problems.</p>
        <p>Joining Soutine At Society's Margins</p>
        <p>I feel honored to be showing at the Jewish Museum at the same time as Soutine. I marvel at the excellent selections by Norman Kleeblatt and Ken Silver. Their idea of quoting from the famous French critics of the time that characterize Soutine as either Jewish naif or French master or, later, as prophet of Abstract Expressionism, was brilliant in pinpointing some of their fumblings.</p>
        <p>Despite Soutine's frequent citing of the influence that Rembrandt's work and attitudes had on him, this was rarely considered in the writing on him. I was deeply moved by his portraits of people on the margins of society: the bellhops, the chefs, the survivors usually treated with contempt and disdain by the bourgeoisie. Like Rembrandt, Soutine examined them with care, love, compassion. Is that Jewish? Christian? Both?</p>
        <p>Not only were the specific portraits exaggerated for rhythm and invented color, they are remarkably accurate psychological penetrations. ''The Village Idiot'' impressed me greatly. Many people regard someone like this as a mistake of nature. Once their grinning clown act is dropped, they slip into an expression of gravitas and angst, their yearning for normalcy glaringly clear. Soutine recognized this desire. In his portrait, the idiot realizes his lacks, and Soutine reveals his great desire to be normal. Through his compassion for his subject, Soutine recognizes the needs and drives of this man and in the process demonstrates how impossible it is to separate the physical from one's mental, invisible, spiritual existence.</p>
