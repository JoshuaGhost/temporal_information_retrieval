        <p>Taking a defiant stance toward prosecutors and political critics, White House officials said today that President Clinton would continue to maintain that he had had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and would pursue another Supreme Court showdown, this time over an appeals  court decision ordering a top aide to testify in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is not scheduled to testify until Aug. 17, and his advisers cautioned that only he and a small cadre of lawyers were privy to his deliberations. But in what appeared to be a concerted effort several Clinton aides today dismissed pleas from Republican Congressmen and some former officials that Mr. Clinton acknowledge having had an affair with the former White House intern to blunt and perhaps end the six-month investigation by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.</p>

        <p>Taking a defiant stance toward prosecutors and political critics, White House officials said today that President Clinton would continue to maintain that he had had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky and would pursue another Supreme Court showdown, this time over an appeals  court decision ordering a top aide to testify in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is not scheduled to testify until Aug. 17, and his advisers cautioned that only he and a small cadre of lawyers were privy to his deliberations. But in what appeared to be a concerted effort several Clinton aides today dismissed pleas from Republican Congressmen and some former officials that Mr. Clinton acknowledge having had an affair with the former White House intern to blunt and perhaps end the six-month investigation by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.</p>
        <p>''The President has told the truth about this and he will continue to do so,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, in response to questions. ''I have no reason to think that that has changed in any way.''</p>
        <p>Officials expressed annoyance over what they called a presumption that the President was lying when he denied in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct suit that he had had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. They said Mr. Clinton's agreement to testify, despite White House suspicion of Mr. Starr's motives, proved that he had nothing to fear.</p>
        <p>''It is a little insulting to turn on the television and see people come up with the brilliant idea that he should tell the truth,'' one official said. ''Do you think anyone here is going in and saying, 'Sir, you should lie'?''</p>
        <p>Each weekday morning, the President's political advisers and spokesmen, who are generally in the dark about his legal strategy, meet with members of the White House Counsel's office for guidance on how to respond to the day's developments in the investigation. Aides who spoke about the President's position appeared to have based their comments on such discussions.</p>
        <p>As the White House affirmed Mr. Clinton's denials, forensic scientists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation crime laboratory completed a first set of tests on a blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors. Prosecutors are trying to determine whether the dress had been stained during a sexual encounter with Mr. Clinton. The first test, performed under extremely tight security, was intended to determine whether the stain had been caused by semen, but the result was being very closely held.</p>
        <p>On a day of rapid-fire legal motions and court decisions, the White House also served notice that it would ask the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's decision compelling Bruce Lindsey, a White House lawyer who is the President's closest adviser, to testify to the Lewinsky grand jury. After that decision, Lanny Breuer, another member of the White House counsel's office, was subpoenaed last week to testify on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breuer, who served in the Manhattan District Attorney's office and then in private practice here before joining the counsel's office, has been central to the President's damage control effort since the Lewinksy accusations surfaced in January. The decision to subpoena him suggests that Mr. Starr is again training his sights on the small group of White House lawyers with intimate knowledge of how Mr. Clinton has planned his defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr is investigating not only whether Mr. Clinton lied under oath and sought to cover it up, but whether he tried to obstruct Mr. Starr's investigation into both those questions. The appeals court's decision could permit Mr. Starr to question the rest of the lawyers, including the White House Counsel himself, Charles F. C. Ruff.</p>
        <p>The White House filed a motion today with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking to block testimony by Mr. Breuer and other lawyers while it awaits action by the Supreme Court. That motion was rejected, but the White House filed the same request tonight with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. The Chief Justice would have to act by 9:15 Tuesday morning to stop Mr. Breuer's testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsey, who has said he knows of no wrongdoing or criminal conduct, cited lawyer-client privilege in declining to answer some questions before a grand jury here.</p>
        <p>In its divided ruling last week, a three-judge panel of the appeals court found that no such privilege could protect a Government lawyer from testifying in a criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruff said the appeals court decision would undercut any President's ability to get honest advice.</p>
        <p>''This privilege ultimately serves the public interest by insuring fully informed decision making through open and candid discussions between clients and attorneys,'' Mr. Ruff said in a statement today. ''The confidential nature of the attorney-client privilege relationship is no less important in government than in every other context where it exists.''</p>
        <p>In another running legal contest between Mr. Starr and the White House, the appeals court handed down a mixed ruling today, deciding  that an investigation may continue into whether Mr. Starr's office had illegally disclosed grand jury material. The investigation is being conducted by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who presides over the grand jury hearing the Lewinsky case.</p>
        <p>But, overruling part of a decision by Judge Johnson, the appeals court ruled that the President's lawyers might not on their own depose Mr. Starr's prosecutors or demand documents from them, said a lawyer familiar with the ruling, which was sealed. Instead, Judge Johnson must review and approve any documents that are to be turned over by Mr. Starr's office, to insure that they do not reveal grand jury secrets.</p>
        <p>David E. Kendall, the President's personal lawyer, has accused Mr. Starr's office of illegally slipping information to reporters and has sought sanctions against it. Mr. Starr has denied such leaks.</p>
        <p>Aides to the President said today that Mr. Clinton betrayed no sign of nervousness about his prospective testimony. ''The most comforting thing in the White House now is that the President seems totally comfortable,'' said one Clinton aide who is not part of his damage-control team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton confined his public comments today to legislative matters. In a speech to summer workers in Cheverly, Md., he warned Republican leaders that he would not accept a ''bare-bones'' budget from them.</p>
        <p>''The House Republican plan puts politics ahead of people and puts your future in the back seat,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''That is wrong.''</p>
        <p>With veto threats hanging over seven appropriations bills, the White House is on a collision course with Congress over the budget, though that dispute has been obscured by the furor over Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr also gave a speech today, appearing before a lawyers' group in Toronto. He reviewed the Supreme Court's performance this year, calling it ''quite impressive.''</p>
        <p>He said he had learned from a defeat he suffered this year before the Supreme Court, which ruled that he could not have access to notes taken by a lawyer for Vincent W. Foster Jr., the White House deputy counsel who committed suicide in the President's first term. The Court ruled that a client's death did not weaken the attorney-client privilege.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr said that ''the court reminded us that there are other considerations, there are other values,'' besides the pursuit of truth.''</p>
        <p>''The law, embodying the wisdom of the ages, has seen fit to protect relationships, even at the expense of truth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even some of the President's advisers have doubts about his truthfulness regarding Ms. Lewinsky, and some think that by changing his story he could bring an end to a drama that has transfixed Washington and stunted progress on Capitol Hill. But many Clinton allies also believe that an admission by Mr. Clinton would be turned against him.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Clinton's advisers said his team of political and legal aides was nervously awaiting the test results on Ms. Lewinsky's dress. If DNA testing links the dress to Mr. Clinton, this adviser said, White House thinking on his testimony may change.</p>
        <p>Unlike laboratory findings in most prominent cases, which are widely distributed in the upper echelons of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, the Lewinsky laboratory tests are being provided to only a handful of technicians and senior F.B.I. officials. They in turn reveal the findings directly to Mr. Starr.</p>
