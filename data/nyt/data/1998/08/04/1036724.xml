        <p>The Justice Department accused a 79-year-old retired Brooklyn businessman yesterday of lying about his past as a Nazi war criminal to enter the United States more than 40 years ago, and asked a Federal judge to revoke his citizenship, the first step to his deportation.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the man, Jack Reimer, a former potato chip salesman and restaurateur, sharply criticized the Government's evidence and said that his client, who was born in Ukraine and came to the United States in 1952, was a prisoner of war during World War II who had never lied to the American authorities.</p>

        <p>The Justice Department accused a 79-year-old retired Brooklyn businessman yesterday of lying about his past as a Nazi war criminal to enter the United States more than 40 years ago, and asked a Federal judge to revoke his citizenship, the first step to his deportation.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the man, Jack Reimer, a former potato chip salesman and restaurateur, sharply criticized the Government's evidence and said that his client, who was born in Ukraine and came to the United States in 1952, was a prisoner of war during World War II who had never lied to the American authorities.</p>
        <p>But a Justice Department lawyer, Edward A. Stutman, told Judge Lawrence M. McKenna that Mr. Reimer  had been a skilled and highly decorated commander at a Nazi SS training camp in Trawniki, Poland, who participated in the mass execution of 50 to 60 Jews there, and who led his men in missions to liquidate Jewish ghettos in Poland between 1941 and 1945.</p>
        <p>''The Government will show,'' Mr. Stutman said, ''that the Trawniki training camp was in every respect imaginable a training ground for persecution and murder, and the defendant was one of its first teachers.''</p>
        <p>As the lawyers presented sharply contrasting accounts of his past on the first day of his trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Reimer sat impassively at the defense table, dressed casually in a sweater and sneakers, beside his lawyer, Ramsey Clark.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark, a former Attorney General in the Johnson Administration, suggested that the Government had wildly exaggerated Mr. Reimer's status in the SS, and he attacked the reliability of the witnesses and historical documents Mr. Stutman said he would introduce.</p>
        <p>''The Government speaks as if the documents are overwhelmingly clear on these subjects, and they are just the opposite,'' Mr. Clark told Judge McKenna, who is hearing the case without a jury.</p>
        <p>During a break in the proceedings before Judge McKenna, Mr. Clark told reporters that there would be no comment from his client, whom he described as a friendly, cheerful and religious man.</p>
        <p>''His feeling as a religious person is that we are all tested and this is his test,'' Mr. Clark said.</p>
        <p>He also criticized the Justice Department's decision to prosecute Mr. Reimer after so long, saying, ''Perhaps they're running out of business.''</p>
        <p>''He's hardly Ivan the Terrible,'' Mr. Clark added, a reference to the notorious gas chamber operator at the Treblinka death camp in Poland. (John Demjanjuk, a retired auto worker from Cleveland, was accused of having been Ivan but was later cleared after a long legal battle.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Stutman told Judge McKenna yesterday that the Government would prove Mr. Reimer's participation in ''acts of persecution through clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence.''</p>
        <p>He said that evidence would include 132 written statements of ''victims, witnesses, perpetrators and accused perpetrators,'' including two by Mr. Reimer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reimer's varying accounts of his role have long been an issue of contention.</p>
        <p>The Government has introduced a transcript of a 1992 interrogation in which he acknowledged, without a defense lawyer present, that he shot at one man in the mass killing of 50 to 60 Jews near Trawniki, and agreed with a prosecutor's suggestion that he had ''finished him off.''</p>
        <p>In court, Mr. Clark, who has sought to have that testimony suppressed, told the judge that Government lawyers interviewing Mr. Reimer ''badgered him and badgered him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reimer gave a new account in a 1997 interview with Government investigators, saying that by the time he had arrived at the pit where the Jews had been herded for execution, all appeared to be already dead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reimer said that he fired one shot, directing it away so that it would not hit any of the bodies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stutman said that the Government would present detailed evidence -- including the statements of two Trawniki SS men -- to prove that Mr. Reimer was not only in command of other armed Trawniki guards but that he and the others all fired their weapons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reimer's ''most recent assertion, in which he changes the trajectory of his bullet, does not diminish his personal role in this process of persecution,'' Mr. Stutman added.</p>
