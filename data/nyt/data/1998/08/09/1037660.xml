        <p>Foreclosing Outside Of Court</p>
        <p>Q: I hear that the New York State Legislature recently passed a bill to permit some foreclosures out of court. If this bill is signed into law by the Governor, how will it change the state's existing nonjudicial foreclosure statute (which has been on the books for nearly 80 years but is almost never used)? . . . Alfred Markberry, Ardsley, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A: Steven L. Einig, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in foreclosures, said that the bill referred to by the letter writer was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki on July 7. The bill amends the state's foreclosure law by replacing the section of the law that governs nonjudicial foreclosures. The bill was drafted, Mr. Einig said, because the prior law was so complex it was hardly ever used. But while the former law covered essentially all mortgages, the new law applies only to commercial mortgages and contains provisions designed to protect residential tenants. All other foreclosures require court supervision.</p>

        <p>Foreclosing Outside Of Court</p>
        <p>Q: I hear that the New York State Legislature recently passed a bill to permit some foreclosures out of court. If this bill is signed into law by the Governor, how will it change the state's existing nonjudicial foreclosure statute (which has been on the books for nearly 80 years but is almost never used)? . . . Alfred Markberry, Ardsley, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A: Steven L. Einig, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in foreclosures, said that the bill referred to by the letter writer was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki on July 7. The bill amends the state's foreclosure law by replacing the section of the law that governs nonjudicial foreclosures. The bill was drafted, Mr. Einig said, because the prior law was so complex it was hardly ever used. But while the former law covered essentially all mortgages, the new law applies only to commercial mortgages and contains provisions designed to protect residential tenants. All other foreclosures require court supervision.</p>
        <p>A nonjudicial foreclosure, Mr. Einig said, is a foreclosure that takes place without the supervision of the courts. ''There's no judge, no jury, and the sales usually take place outside the courthouse,'' he said. In a nonjudicial foreclosure under the new law, Mr. Einig said, a borrower who is in default and who has ignored all opportunities to ''cure'' that default must be given 30 days' written notice of the lender's intent to foreclose. At the expiration of the 30-day period, Mr. Einig said, the lender publishes a notice of sale in a local newspaper alerting the borrower and any other lienholders of the date and time of the foreclosure sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Einig said that permitting nonjudicial foreclosures of commercial mortgages enables lenders to reduce the time it takes for a foreclosure to go through the judicial process.  ''Even a noncontested judicial foreclosure can take over a year to complete,'' he said, adding that it was not uncommon for such foreclosures to take two years or more. A nonjudicial foreclosure, on the other hand, can be completed in just a few months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Einig said that to protect residential tenants, the amendment prohibits nonjudicial foreclosures when residential tenants could face eviction. The amendment also prohibits nonjudicial foreclosures in buildings where 65 percent or more of the units are residential, even if the foreclosure was to be conducted in such a way as to preclude the eviction of any residential tenants.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Einig said, the amendment allows borrowers whose mortgages predate its effective date of July 7 to demand a judicial foreclosure simply by advising the lender of that demand within 40 days of receipt of the notice of intent to foreclose. Those with mortgages made on or after the effective date can obtain a judicial foreclosure only by court order.</p>
        <p>Needing a Permit For a Retaining Wall</p>
        <p>Q: Is a permit needed to construct a retaining wall four feet high -- three feet of which would be underground -- to keep flooding out of my backyard? My next-door neighbor already has a retaining wall. As a result, in addition to the water that normally flows into my backyard, I also end up with the water being stopped by his retaining wall. In torrential rains, water even comes into our house. . . . Jean Tully, Flushing, Queens.</p>
        <p>A: Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Buildings, said that the letter writer probably needs a permit for the installation of the wall.</p>
        <p>''And to get the permit she'll need a drawing from an architect or engineer,'' Ms. Fink said, explaining that it is possible that such a drawing would also be necessary for officials -- as well as the letter writer -- to determine whether the wall to be constructed falls within the letter writer's property lines.</p>
        <p>''The engineers here at the department also suggest that the property owner might want to think about installing a yard drain,'' Ms. Fink said, adding that such a drain would properly channel the water off the letter writer's property without passing it along to neighbors ''downstream.''</p>
