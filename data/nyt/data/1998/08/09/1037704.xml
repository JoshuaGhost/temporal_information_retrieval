        <p>ANYONE who thinks science is dry and technical should go to the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, where a new exhibition, The Experiment Gallery, is running through Sept. 13. Described as ''science fun for everyone where you do the experiments,'' the exhibition features 26 hands-on activity stations exploring sound, light, weather, mechanics and electricity.</p>
        <p>Visitors of all ages can examine the scientific principles behind sound waves, the color of light, seasonal weather patterns and more, using instruments, experiments and objects that demonstrate various concepts.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is part of the museum's new science initiative, said Philip Verre, its director. When the museum was founded in 1914, he said, its mission was to present art, history and science. Over the years, science has generally been relegated to the Andrus Planetarium, but, Mr. Verre said, ''We realize that there was a need for more than astronomy -- people called up asking for weather observation studies, environmental programs, and so forth.'' Mr. Verre and other staff members and the board members set about planning a strategy to present scientific theories in colorful, amusing and informative ways to the public.</p>
        <p>The Experiment Gallery includes ''Make Snow in Summer,'' in which visitors can create snowflakes with their own breath: visitors breathe into a chamber where there are crystallized pieces of dry ice and the warm breath creates snowflakes. There is also ''Control the Wind,'' where people boil ice, inflate balloons and float bubbles in a bottle, and ''discover the shock of electricity,'' in which a hand crank is used to generate electrical power.</p>
        <p>The museum hours are Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. and Fridays noon to 9 P.M. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission is $3, $1.50 for children 12 and younger and people 62 and older. The number to call for information is 963-4550.</p>
        <p>Nor is the future being ignored. As part of the science initiative, the museum has already planned ''Hudson Riverama,'' a large permanent exhibition scheduled to open in 2000. It will ''take visitors through six distinct Hudson River environments and explore occupations and activities related to the river,'' according to museum literature.</p>
        <p>''For most visitors, the Hudson River is an important but little understood presence,'' a proposal for ''Hudson Riverama'' reads. ''Most people do not know the role the river played in human history. People are unaware of the existence of over 200 different animal species living in and around the estuary.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition will include dioramas, paintings and special theatrical effects, including ambient sound, light and video ''to re-create an ever-changing Hudson River, where weather, time of day and water level simulate the real world.''</p>
        <p>The proposal continues: ''Entering the source, we discover a pristine habitat along the river, hearing the rushing stream, wind rustling through leaves and branches, and scratching and sniffing sounds of mammals moving earth to uncover food sources.''</p>
        <p>Also on display will be ''the rich, dense, aural New York City environment replete with tugboat engines, helicopters, foghorns, sea gull cries and the roar of cars rushing into the Holland Tunnel,'' according to the proposal.</p>
        <p>There will also be environmental reproductions of the Adirondacks and Lake Tear in the Clouds, where the river starts. Using binoculars, people can get a hawk's eye view of the lake below and search, as a hawk would, for food, spotting mice, moles, fish and rabbits. There will be a mechanical simulation of hawks' wings to experience the motion of flight.</p>
        <p>''And this is just the beginning,'' Mr. Verre said. ''It is very exciting to  show the interrelationship between art, history and science. People are more and more interested in the natural world, and we feel that we can present it to them in a new and special way.''</p>
