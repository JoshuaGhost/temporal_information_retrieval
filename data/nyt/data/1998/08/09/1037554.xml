        <p>RANSOM</p>
        <p>The Untold Story of</p>
        <p>International Kidnapping.</p>
        <p>By Ann Hagedorn Auerbach.</p>
        <p>481 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Henry Holt &amp; Company. $25.</p>
        <p>The cold war had its blessings. One was that an American tourist or businessman wasn't so likely to be kidnapped in the so-called third world; guerrillas were too busy knocking over banks or blowing up local police stations. But in today's no-boundaries, mountain-climbing, eco-traveling, adventure-stretching world, tourists and profit-seeking foreign businessmen have become food for the fish that used to swim among the people. In places like Cambodia, Yemen, the Philippines, Kashmir, Mexico and especially Colombia, where kidnappers are as common as bodyguards, foreigners might as well wear dollar figures on their Banana Republics. Ransom demands start in the millions, and, as protection rackets go, business is good.</p>
        <p>So Ann Hagedorn Auerbach reports, in what might have been an exciting foray into this shadowy world but instead dissolves into a moralistic tale relying principally on secondhand sources and the pronouncements of government spokesmen. Auerbach, the author of ''Wild Ride: The Rise and Tragic Fall of Calumet Farm, Inc.,'' lends her considerable compassion to the kidnapping targets and their families, who well deserve it for the cruel suffering they must endure. But this leads her to sacrifice a journalistic detachment that might have more effectively served her subject. Let the victims write their own stories.</p>
        <p>Still, she's onto something. As she reports in ''Ransom,'' worldwide kidnappings have soared from a total of 951 in 73 countries between 1968 and 1982 to 6,500 in Latin America alone in 1995. By 1996 there were four kidnappings a day in Colombia, the Fort Knox of ransom proceeds, with $328.9 million forked over by corporations and families from 1991 through 1994.</p>
        <p>Why the upsurge? For one, there are more targets available, including a record 3.27 million Americans living abroad. Foreign travel has increased yearly by 10 percent, Auerbach notes, to over 50 million travelers in 1995, with many drawn to such ever more remote and exotic offerings as rain forests and tours of stone-age tribes in situ. How wonderfully exciting, but also dangerously provocative, considering that the income gap between tourists and locals tripled between 1960 and 1993.</p>
        <p>Auerbach's story begins grippingly enough in the early morning of Aug. 13, 1995, when peasant women in Indian-occupied Kashmir discover a headless torso on the side of the road. It turns out to be that of Hans Christian Ostro, a Norwegian tourist kidnapped two months earlier, along with two Americans, two ''Brits'' (as Auerbach annoyingly calls them) and a German who had gone mountaineering in the high foothills of the Himalayas. The initials of Al Faran, a Pakistani-backed Muslim separatist group, had been carved in his chest. One of the Americans, a Connecticut businessman, John Childs, escaped after five days; the fates of the rest remain unknown.</p>
        <p>This tortuous tale, with its three years of heartbreaking waiting, interagency wrangling, dedicated bureaucrats, colorful private operatives, aborted rescues and bitter Pakistani-Indian rivalries, would have been plenty enough for a thrilling -- and sobering -- book. Instead, the scope of ''Ransom'' is expanded to other kidnappings, the purpose of which appears to be to roll out portraits of steely-eyed ex-C.I.A. and British operatives who people the ranks of private kidnap negotiators. As it is, Auerbach loses traction on her story every time she cuts away for excursions to kidnappings in other countries or, worse, dreary expositions on the history of kidnapping. She also fails to develop tantalizing tidbits about the activities of a United States Delta Force team sent to Kashmir, or the ability of American spy satellites to fix the kidnappers' location by tracking their radiotelephone calls. Granted, such secrets are hard to crack, as are the behind-the-scenes negotiations carried out by government agents or shadowy businesses like Control Risks Group, the London-based concern often called on to secure someone's release. But that is the real story of a ransom, and it's the one we want to read.</p>
