        <p>NOT only does the ''skirmish of wit'' between Beatrice (played by Nance Williamson) and Benedick (Kurt Rhoads) flourish resplendently in the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival's joyous staging of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' at the Boscobel Restoration here but the young lord of ''confirmed honesty'' and unconfirmed bachelorhood and Shakespeare's Lady Tongue are also some sparring sexy pair.</p>
        <p>From the company's characteristically cheering welcome to the audience -- this time, by means of a messenger drinking espresso, instantly dispensing an Italianate flavor -- to an ominous portent of fascism hovering, musically and in striking visual imagery at the end, Nick Mangano has directed a theater piece of intelligence, substance, high style and low-jinks.</p>

        <p>NOT only does the ''skirmish of wit'' between Beatrice (played by Nance Williamson) and Benedick (Kurt Rhoads) flourish resplendently in the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival's joyous staging of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' at the Boscobel Restoration here but the young lord of ''confirmed honesty'' and unconfirmed bachelorhood and Shakespeare's Lady Tongue are also some sparring sexy pair.</p>
        <p>From the company's characteristically cheering welcome to the audience -- this time, by means of a messenger drinking espresso, instantly dispensing an Italianate flavor -- to an ominous portent of fascism hovering, musically and in striking visual imagery at the end, Nick Mangano has directed a theater piece of intelligence, substance, high style and low-jinks.</p>
        <p>His concept of love's continuing merry war is played in contrast to and in concert with the ephemera of national peace. Good times are not here to stay. Menace looms. Today, Sicily; tomorrow, the world. The director's notion is sustained by a company as gifted in dealing with the masks, the tarantellas and the tambourines in ''Finiculli, Finiculla'' (so infectious, it inspires an audience clap-along) as in imparting the duplicities of man's inherent villainy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williamson's Beatrice is a gorgeous, witty representation of an eternal challenge: a woman with a face, a mind and a mouth, who dares a man to embrace her defiance, as a natural and essential component of her love.</p>
        <p>Her ''every word stabs.'' And yes, she is ''pleasant -- spirited,'' too, a ''dear Lady Disdain'' who happens to be alluring, charming, mistress of the withering put-down, impossible to resist and easy to believe when she stakes her claim to a celestial place: ''A star danced, and under that was I born.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhoads, a master of self-reflection, is in command of everyone's perception of him, and of his own sublime contradictions. He protests too much, and he knows it. He climbs up the side of the tent and reclines there, a clown in silhouette. He is agile with all the director's required purposeful pranks; the slapstick is never slapdash. His cry of surrender: ''The world must be peopled'' makes the mountains move.</p>
        <p>And that ''mountain of affection'' between Beatrice and Benedict is palpable in the portrayal by Ms. Williamson and Mr. Rhoads. That they are husband and wife off stage is, well, nice to know.</p>
        <p>The actors, in ensemble, communicate the pleasure of language. More so than in past seasons, the Hudson Valley Company confidently attends to words and characterization, not to a pressing need to entertain. As a happy consequence, they have hardly ever been more entertaining. The audience cheers.</p>
        <p>Johnny Garcia's Don John is superbly slick and smarmy, ever charming evil incarnate. The audience jeers. And John Cariani, as Verges and as a messenger, is an endearing Chaplinesque figure, waddling in the distance.</p>
        <p>In their loveliest season, the company plays against nature's all-encompassing greenery, in harmony with human nature's vagaries, implanting an entrancing theater memory, while a summer Sunday's dusk settles.</p>
        <p>The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival production of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' at Boscobel Restoration, Garrison. Performances through next Sunday. Box Office: 265-9575.</p>
