      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Compaq Computer Corporation said yesterday that it had expanded its relationship with Draft Worldwide by naming the agency's New York office to handle its direct marketing account in the United States. The account, with billings estimated at $60 million to $80 million, had been handled for five years by the direct marketing unit of Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York.</p>
        <p>Mike Berman, a spokesman at Compaq in Houston, confirmed a report of the switch this week in Advertising Age. Draft, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies that already handles direct marketing for Compaq in Australia, France and Switzerland, was awarded the domestic account without a formal review. Fifty employees of the direct marketing unit of Ammirati Puris will join the New York office of Draft to work on the Compaq account.</p>

        <p>The decision came two months after Compaq moved the creative and media portions of its $300 million account from Ammirati Puris, which is also owned by Interpublic, to the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group in New York.</p>
