        <p>Investors seemed to be asking, ''Where do we go from here?'' as they warily eyed the stock market in the wake of last week's rout.</p>
        <p>Since last Tuesday's 299.43-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, most market pundits have called for a continued downdraft near term, before the market again picks up steam.</p>
        <p>Forecasts of earnings growth in the third quarter were quickly ratcheted lower; analysts now see earnings for companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks growing 6.4 percent this year, down from the 15.1 percent forecast on Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Now investors seem to be taking a defensive stance. ''There are no heroes,'' said Charles W. Johnson, head equity trader at Blaylock &amp; Partners in Baltimore. ''No one wants to be the first one out there. People are not quite sure what's going on, so they're waiting for someone else to give them direction.''</p>
        <p>A rally among small-company shares, which rose smartly late last week, faltered yesterday, leaving the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks closing lower than it had a week earlier. The Russell fell 4.16 points, to 411.64, a 1 percent decline.</p>
        <p>Drug company shares rose, helping stem further declines among larger-company stocks. Investors bought shares of Merck, Warner Lambert and Schering-Plough, as they sought a haven from continued Asian weakness. Some fear that Japan's woes could force China to devalue its currency.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the purchases should help the health care sector, down 8.9 percent since July 17, rebound soon.</p>
        <p>While domestic equity markets were little changed, prices fell in Asia, Latin America and Europe.</p>
        <p>In the recent market rout -- from the highs on July 17 through last Friday -- financial stocks were the worst performers among the 11 sectors that make up the S.&amp; P. 500, down 12 percent, and they fell again yesterday, largely because of exposure to Asia.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan fell 3 5/16, to 120 3/16, accounting for more than half the decline in the Dow industrials, which fell 23.17 points, to 8,574.85. The S.&amp; P. 500 lost 6.31, to 1,083.14. The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.56, closing at 1,839.21.</p>
        <p>Despite those declines, a number of analysts are optimistic that financial shares will soon resume their place as stellar performers.</p>
        <p>Tom Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said brokerage-firm stocks might have been hurt by the decline in initial public offerings and a lack of investor confidence in the market. He foresees no recession, however,  and predicts that the environment of low inflation will be good for financials, retailers and home builders.</p>
        <p>''We think this is a buying opportunity,'' said Raphael Soifer, financial services analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. Although, he said, financial stocks would probably be volatile near term, ''when the market turns up, we expect them to lead.''</p>
        <p>Longer term, he likes Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>Mike Farrell, a quantitative analyst with Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford, predicts that savings and loans will continue to falter, as low interest rates increase the risk that borrowers will prepay mortgages.</p>
        <p>In the next 6 to 12 months, Mr. Galvin believes that financials, health care, and technology stocks will resume their roles as market leaders. Since July 17, health care stocks have fallen 8.9 percent.</p>
        <p>Managed-care companies will continue to be under pressure because of the Medicare reimbursement process, Mr. Galvin added.</p>
        <p>Although recent stock market declines scuttled United Healthcare's  planned purchase of its rival, Humana, consolidations in the industry are likely to continue, he said, because few managed-care programs have been very cost effective.</p>
        <p>While technology companies were toppled early by Asia's malaise, they have been one of the better performing sectors in the S.&amp; P. 500 since the July highs -- down just 5.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Stocks like Compaq, Intel and Motorola, which declined as much as 25 percent in the second quarter, should reverse those declines, as inventories shrink and seasonal demand for computers picks up, analysts said. As a result, the outperformance of telephones and utilities, a defensive play, should be outlived. The communication sector fell just 5 percent in the period.</p>
