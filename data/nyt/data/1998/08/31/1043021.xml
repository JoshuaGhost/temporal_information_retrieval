        <p>Weight has long been the great equalizer in horse racing, and today at Monmouth Park, it almost humbled Skip Away.</p>
        <p>Almost.</p>
        <p>Spotting his six modest rivals from 16 to 20 pounds as he carried top weight of 131 pounds, Skip Away was caught in midstretch by Stormin Fever but rallied through the final sixteenth to win the $500,000 Iselin Handicap by a nose, his eighth straight victory.</p>
        <p>The crowd of 19,107 gasped in disbelief as Stormin Fever, a 10-1 shot whose only victories this year have been in allowance races, moved up rapidly on the far turn and took dead aim at the prohibitive favorite at the head of the stretch. Under vigorous urging from Jose Santos, Stormin Fever -- who carried 113 pounds -- poked a nose in front in the deep stretch, but Skip Away came back on the inside in the final strides and actually was pulling off at the wire.</p>
        <p>''It probably scared a lot of people more than me,'' said Jerry Bailey, the jockey, who sent Skip Away to the lead after a half-mile. ''He was in a neutral mode, and when the other horse came to him, I could feel his motor start running again. With the weight, it took him a few strides to get going again.''</p>
        <p>The performance surprised Santos. ''At the eighth pole, I thought I was home free,'' the jockey said. ''Skip Away had to really show class today to come back and beat me.''</p>
        <p>Sonny Hine, Skip Away's trainer, said: ''Skippy never gives up. I wasn't worried when that other horse came up to him.''</p>
        <p>If Hine had a concern, it was over another matter. This morning, when Hine and his wife Carolyn, the horse's owner, went to check on him, they found Skip Away had had a reaction to a routine medicated cream for his legs.</p>
        <p>When the horse's leg wraps were removed in the morning, Sonny Hine said: ''Some of his skin had come off. I don't know why. He never had a reaction before. We put him in ice to desensitize him. He was sound, but his legs were irritated.''</p>
        <p>The condition did not appear to slow Skip Away down. His time of 1 minute 471/5  seconds was two-fifths of a second off the track record.</p>
        <p>It was the sixth straight graded stakes victory this year for the 5-year-old, who had last run in the Hollywood Gold Cup on June 28. After that, Hine had considered waiting until the Sept. 19 Woodward at Belmont Park, but Monmouth increased the Iselin purse to $500,000 from $250,000 and the distance to one and one-eighth miles from one and one-sixteenth to insure Skip Away's presence on his home track. ''I'm glad we came,'' Carolyn Hine said. ''It's like being in your own backyard.''</p>
        <p>His $300,000 share of the purse boosted Skip Away's lifetime earnings to $9,206,360, just under $800,000 shy of Cigar's record of $9,999,915. Sonny Hine hopes Skip Away will crack the $10 million mark by the end of the year. Following the Woodward, he is scheduled to run in the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 10 and the $4 million Breeders Cup Classic on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>Skip Away returned $2.10 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>''He came back to the winner's circle and he was even blowing,'' Sonny Hine said. ''He ran hard, but he didn't run any harder than he had to. He's a real champion.''</p>
