        <p>And Achilles made fast to strike at the walls of Troy,</p>
        <p>But Odysseus cautioned him and said, ''The sons of Priam are mighty.</p>
        <p>Let us first make use of Androstenedione.''</p>
        <p>And Peleus's son Achilles said, ''I do not know that name. What goddess, muse or sprite is Androstenedione,</p>
        <p>That we may pray to her for victory?''</p>
        <p>''None of those, but a nutritional supplement that raises the level of Testosterone,'' whispered the wily Odysseus.</p>
        <p>''Does Testosterone fight as a soldier in the ranks of our flowing-haired Achaeans? How is it that I do not know his name?'' asked Peleus's son.</p>
        <p>''Rather is Testosterone an ichor in our veins. It thickens our sinews and inflames our hearts.''</p>
        <p>So the Achaeans partook of Androstenedione, and thereafter, wherever they spat, hair would grow up from the earth.</p>
        <p>''It does, however, cause mood swings,'' Odysseus admitted later,</p>
        <p>After Achilles slaughtered the inhabitants of Chryse and smashed the temple of Apollo there,</p>
        <p>Because of a disputed restaurant check.</p>
        <p>Now the god Apollo was angered by this and appeared to the men of Troy saying,</p>
        <p>''You will face the greatest Achaean in battle tomorrow, but not without the aid of Creatine.''</p>
        <p>Hector applauded, saying, ''I knew Crete would not stay out of this,</p>
        <p>And now they have sent their warrior-king Creatine to save us.''</p>
        <p>But the wise god Apollo said, ''Say not that Creatine is a man, for it is instead an amino acid that . . . look, just take it, O.K.?''</p>
        <p>''It says on the side of the bottle, 'Not recommended for use by persons in whom burns the unwearying fire of Pallas Athena's divine breath,' '' vouched Paris. ' ''Or by persons allergic to shellfish.' ''</p>
        <p>''Just take it,'' the healer and archer Apollo said again.</p>
        <p>''I use a kava kava and shark cartilage supplement already,'' said Aeneas. ''Is there any danger of a negative interaction?''</p>
        <p>''If this continues, I'm going to scream,'' said the mighty and ingenious god.</p>
        <p>But Zeus went cloaked among the Achaeans and gave them turtle glands marinated in ephedrine and desiccated with brewer's yeast,</p>
        <p>And Hera, seeing this, visited her favored Trojans and fed them spirulina mead infused with equine growth hormone.</p>
        <p>And many from each side sacrificed to Anabolis, goddess of steroids,</p>
        <p>So that when the day of battle came and the Olympic Committee for the Ilionic Wars conducted the customary tests,</p>
        <p>Each warrior's urine caused the testing cup to burst into flames.</p>
        <p>And the bravest and mightiest of each side cast off his therapeutic magnets, and the fight was joined.</p>
        <p>Now as a wild boar having fed on ginseng will charge down from the hills did Hector hew among the Achaeans,</p>
        <p>And as a mighty bear gorged on protein powder will pounce upon helpless fish, now did Achilles lay waste to the Trojans in his path.</p>
        <p>There fell, as a white poplar topples, Amphimachos, son of Aktorian Kteatos, a pioneer in the use of enzymatic hawk liver,</p>
        <p>And pierced in the chest by an Achaean spear was Othryoneus, who introduced pollen and lycine tablets to warfare.</p>
        <p>When the day ended and the strong-greaved Achaeans withdrew, Achilles had slain two and sixty Trojans, eclipsing the modern record set by Agamemnon.</p>
        <p>Then did the press gather around his locker to find Achilles heavy with weeping.</p>
        <p>''For all of my glory, I am strangely depressed,'' cried the warrior. ''Does not one of you have any St. John's Wort?''</p>
