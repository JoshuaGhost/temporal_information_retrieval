        <p>An Appellate Division judge yesterday reinstated an injunction barring the City University of New York from proceeding with preparations for a ban on remedial classes at its senior colleges in September 1999.</p>
        <p>CUNY had won a temporary stay of the injunction issued earlier this month by Justice Elliott J. Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who ruled that the university could not prepare for the remedial ban before a trial on whether the board had violated the state's open meetings law when it adopted the policy in May.</p>
