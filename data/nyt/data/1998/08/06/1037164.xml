        <p>ERNST &amp; YOUNG said yesterday that it had named D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Communications in New York to handle its account. While the selection of the agency was no surprise, the amount of business that the shop landed was more than expected.</p>
        <p>Speculation that D.M.B.&amp; B. would win Ernst &amp; Young's domestic account, with billings estimated at $15 million or less, had circulated since late last month. But when the decision was announced, it included the accounting firm's entire worldwide advertising and branding account, with billings estimated at more than $100 million.</p>

        <p>ERNST &amp; YOUNG said yesterday that it had named D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Communications in New York to handle its account. While the selection of the agency was no surprise, the amount of business that the shop landed was more than expected.</p>
        <p>Speculation that D.M.B.&amp; B. would win Ernst &amp; Young's domestic account, with billings estimated at $15 million or less, had circulated since late last month. But when the decision was announced, it included the accounting firm's entire worldwide advertising and branding account, with billings estimated at more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>''We are a global organization,'' said Philip A. Laskawy, chairman and chief executive of Ernst &amp; Young L.L.P. ''A global campaign will help us better communicate the consistent, high caliber of our work.'' He said it would promote the company's ''seamless, global integration.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the decision by Ernst &amp; Young is emblematic of the ferment in the financial services field as a growing number of marketers rethink agency relationships. In the last two months, for instance, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company named the J. Walter Thompson Company in New York, part of WPP Group, to handle its $85 million worldwide account, while Charles Schwab &amp; Company consolidated its brand advertising, with billings estimated at $50 million, at the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Grace &amp; Rothschild in New York previously handled creative duties for Ernst &amp; Young in the United States for two years, while Grey Advertising in New York previously handled the media services. The overseas portion of the account was divided among 10 agencies. Last year, Ernst &amp; Young spent $6 million to $8 million worldwide.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Shern, vice chairwoman for marketing and planning at Ernst &amp; Young in New York, said, ''It was our plan and hope all along to select a global agency and to develop a global marketing strategy.'' She added, ''We selected D.M.B.&amp; B. because of the quality of their strategic thinking, their creative capability and their fully integrated communications approach and the team itself.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shern said that D.M.B.&amp; B., which is part of MacManus Group, was awarded the account after a review that began in April when the accounting and consulting company decided to examine all aspects of the company's business following the failure of a proposed merger with KPMG Peat Marwick. The review had been narrowed to D.M.B.&amp; B. and another finalist, DDB Needham Worldwide in New York, also part of Omnicom.</p>
        <p>''It ended up being a tough choice,'' Ms. Shern said, adding that D.M.B.&amp; B. ''hit on all parts of our scoring system. We wanted to engage an agency that would help build the brand for Ernst &amp; Young.''</p>
        <p>In building the brand, Ms. Shern said Ernst &amp; Young hoped to further distinguish itself from competitors like Deloitte &amp; Touche, Price Waterhouse Coopers, KPMG Peat Marwick and Andersen Consulting.</p>
        <p>The Ernst &amp; Young acquisition was a delight and a relief for D.M.B.&amp; B. after a period of shortfalls in other high-profile reviews including Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>''We're absolutely thrilled,'' John Farrell, president of D.M.B.&amp; B. North America said. ''It's a terrific complement to the agency when a client of this stature puts this level of faith and commitment in the agency.'' He added, ''Strategically, Ernst &amp; Young is exactly the kind of business D.M.B.&amp;B. is best at.''</p>
        <p>D.M.B.&amp; B., with more than 6,000 employees in 126 offices in 74 countries, has billings estimated at $5.8 billion from blue-chip clients including Procter &amp; Gamble, General Motors, M&amp;M Mars and Coca-Cola. D.M.B&amp; B.'s New York office will serve as the lead office for the Ernst &amp; Young global account, which will aim at primary markets including the United States, Britain, France, and Germany.</p>
        <p>The Ernst &amp; Young acquisitioncomes on the heels of another worldwide account gain for the agency. Last week, Avon Products Inc. in New York expanded its relationship with D.M.B.&amp; B. and its sibling, N. W. Ayer &amp; Partners in New York, by consolidating its worldwide advertising between the two. Those billings were estimated at more than $65 million.</p>
        <p>D.M.B.&amp; B. had been hoping to help compensate for the loss in late March of the Gateway computer company after handling its worldwide account for a year. The account, with billings estimated at $50 million to $70 million, had been one of the 10 largest at D.M.B.&amp; B.</p>
        <p>A new campaign for Ernst &amp; Young is expected to be introduced in October. Details regarding the campaign were not disclosed, other than that it would include a replacement for the current theme, ''There isn't a business we can't improve.''</p>
