        <p>They loaded Mcdonald Mafu into the donkey cart about 10 minutes after the doctor signed his papers. He had been dead for two days -- one less than he had lived -- but it took his mother a while to make it to the district hospital so far from her home.</p>
        <p>The whole transaction lasted about two minutes. Dr. Bart Vander Plaetse took a piece of paper with the words ''Notice of the Death of a Person'' printed on top. He wrote down the dead boy's name and for his age he scribbled a fraction: 1/52.</p>
        <p>Since he had no idea of the cause of death, the doctor listed A.R.I. -- acute respiratory infection. ''That's what we say when we can't say something else,'' Dr. Vander Plaetse explained with a sad shrug. ''It'll let his mother bury him.''</p>
        <p>The next sounds floating through the doctor's window were the thud of a cow bell and the whack of a whip as two donkeys hauled the body to the burial ground across the road.</p>
        <p>Mcdonald's mother and grandmother sat in the cart with the cardboard box that held their boy. Several women walked behind softly singing funeral songs. There were no men at the service: Mcdonald's father died a few months ago. His grandfather died last year. A brother died the year before. Three uncles are also gone.</p>
        <p>''You almost can't keep track of it all,'' said Dr. Vander Plaetse, 32, a gentle internist from Belgium, one of two doctors serving this rural area of 140,000 people not far from the border with Botswana.</p>
        <p>''There are just so many sick people,'' he said. ''We want to control it all, and we try. But it's getting harder. There are times when it seems like it's getting out from under us.''</p>
        <p>Death from every type of disease has become so common in Zimbabwe, as in much of Africa, that it no longer seems to matter that this country has become the center of the world's AIDS epidemic. Recent studies now suggest that Zimbabwe may have the highest AIDS infection rate on earth. The optimism of the West is a cruel fantasy in Africa. Here there is no treatment, no cure, little hope and -- in almost every country on this continent -- far more pressing problems to face each day.</p>
        <p>The savage virus has left few people untouched: it has devastated families and communities. But seen through the weary eyes of the beleaguered doctors and nurses who must attend to the sick people around them, AIDS is just another word for dying, and it's just another disease.</p>
        <p>People here call it iyoyo -- that thing. And in the spare but spotless clinics of this nation, where aspirin is available only a third of the time, ''that thing'' may not even be the one that matters most.</p>
        <p>With an average of less than $10 to spend on each person's health every year, most African countries have no money for tests, for fancy drugs or for complicated support networks. Despite the magnitude of the epidemic, the great majority of people in Africa have no idea if they are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and most don't want to know.</p>
        <p>Zimbabwe once had a health system that was the envy of southern Africa. Yet, fueled by AIDS and also by increasing poverty and instability, illness has begun to overcome the country. Tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, measles and cholera -- all wholly preventable -- have surged mercilessly. So have infant mortality, stillbirths and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
        <p>In 1996, during the last heavy rains, this region in the center of Zimbabwe reported 82,000 cases of malaria, which means that more than half of the local population got sick. The hospital here was so overwhelmed that nurses could not even make their way down the teeming halls.</p>
        <p>In 1989, 100 people died of malaria in Zimbabwe. Last year the figure was 2,800. Reported cases of tuberculosis -- the sentinel illness of poverty and social decline -- have risen from 5,000 a year in 1986 to 35,000 last year. This year it is worse.</p>
        <p>The Hard Numbers  Africa Has 90% Of AIDS Deaths</p>
        <p>If the effects of it all are sometimes impossible to believe, they are also impossible to ignore. In Zimbabwe average life expectancy, often considered the most reliable barometer of a nation's health, was 61 in 1993. But by the end of the century, it is projected to fall to 49.</p>
        <p>In 10 years, if the trend continues, United Nations officials say it may be closer to 40, which would push development here back nearly a century. Many other sub-Saharan countries face the same grim prospect.</p>
        <p>''AIDS is the basic fact of all our lives,'' said Dr. Vander Plaetse, whose dawn-to-dusk work day includes dealing with everything from setting bones to major surgery. ''But it is not the only fact. And to be honest, it is not a fact we can do that much about.</p>
        <p>''It may sound callous,'' Dr. Vander Plaetse said, ''but there may be better ways to spend our time and money than treating a complicated disease we will never have the money or the drugs or the ability to cure.''</p>
        <p>It is an understandable comment from a man who could not send his nurses out into the community in July to give vaccines because the Health Ministry had no money left to buy gas for the car.</p>
        <p>''Oh, that's O.K.,'' he said softly. ''Last year we had no radio contact with any other clinic for two months because we couldn't pay a $300 phone bill. It's hard to focus on the big picture when that's happening.''</p>
        <p>It would probably be hard in any case, because numbers like these are almost too great to have meaning: four million people were newly infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa last year alone. The epidemic has already killed 10 million people in that region -- 90 percent of the world's AIDS deaths -- and because there is so little hope of access to the best drugs, at least 20 million more will almost certainly die.</p>
        <p>In Zimbabwe doctors and nurses all know the bad news, and they all worry about it. They face AIDS in one way or another all day, every day: when they see a man with genital herpes, when they draw blood or stick themselves with a needle, when they deliver a baby, when any patient starts to cough or to wheeze or breaks out in a rash. And particularly when people die -- of fevers and wasting and pneumonia or TB.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, 500 people died each week in Zimbabwe. Last year the figure was 650. Now it is close to 750. They die after a ''short illness,'' or they die after a ''long illness.'' The newspapers do not print ages in obituaries. They don't have to. The words ''loving son'' and ''remarkable daughter,'' repeated in nearly every other notice, tell the story clearly enough.</p>
        <p>Tsholotsho is a two-hour drive from Bulawayo, the nearest big city. Most patients walk to get here, sometimes for days across dried river beds and dusty roads. The squat brick hospital is a wide open building at the end of the only paved road in the region.</p>
        <p>Dr. Vander Plaetse sweeps from one room to the next -- setting bones, operating on an elderly woman with internal bleeding, checking the health of pregnant women and seeing dozens of patients with skin rashes, eye diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. He has a chart for everyone, and his nurses are disciplined and extremely well trained.</p>
        <p>The Harried Clinics  AIDS Is Not All: There's Leprosy . . .</p>
        <p>''It's hard to worry about something that is going to kill you one day when so many other problems are going to kill you tomorrow,'' said Dr. Ruth Labode, the frank and energetic medical director for the region that includes Tsholotsho and Bulawayo, the industrial city of 900,000 that is the country's second-largest city. ''Have you ever sat down with a man who is trying to feed his hungry children and had a talk about safe sex? It's not easy.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Labode has a poster on a wall outside her office that lists the ''standard case definition'' of bubonic plague. It is not a historical artifact.</p>
        <p>''We have too many hungry people,'' she says. ''And of course AIDS makes it all worse.''</p>
        <p>At this year's international AIDS conference in Geneva, there was particularly grim news about Zimbabwe and neighboring Botswana. At least in part because statistics are better than in many other developing countries, experts say as many as 25 percent of all adults here may now be infected with H.I.V. In some places -- including tourist crossroads like Victoria Falls -- the rate is closer to 40 percent.</p>
        <p>It would be a staggering figure anywhere, but it is particularly so in a country that can afford to spend only $11 a person each year on health care.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to think about AIDS,'' said Sithozile Nkala, a nurse at the district hospital in Tsholotsho. ''It's not because I am afraid or because I think we can run away from it. But the only way I can do my job is to see every patient and try to just help them. If I say to somebody you have AIDS -- and we almost never know, because we don't have money for tests -- they just go home.</p>
        <p>''That's why I don't think you can write about the effect of AIDS on the health care system. Most people just stay home to die. And we encourage that, because really there is very little we can do here for them except to try and make them comfortable. And people at home can do that better than we can.''</p>
        <p>Miss Nkala is 28, and she came from a small village 125 miles from Tsholotsho. Most people do not want to know if they are infected with H.I.V., she says, and it is common lore among nurses that those who do find out often give up and die much more quickly than if they had lived on in ignorance.</p>
        <p>When Miss Nkala is not tending to patients, she is folding uniforms or towels or wrapping sterile instruments in paper. She is unusual because she has been at the hospital for three years and has no plans to leave.</p>
        <p>Like most regional health care centers, the hospital finds its nursing staff down 50 percent, and recruiting is hard.</p>
        <p>''It's the biggest problem we have,'' Dr. Vander Plaetse said, ''because nurses do nearly everything here. Without them there is no health care.''</p>
        <p>The Unlikely Optimist  Hopeless Is a Word He Won't Use</p>
        <p>Dr. Bornapate Nkomo hates it when people start talking about ''hopeless'' Africa. ''It's a code,'' he said. ''It means let's forget them. They can't be helped. Let's move on to something else.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Nkomo is in charge of treating sexually transmitted diseases in Bulawayo. He is a careful man who spent seven years in Czechoslovakia (when that country still existed). One year was devoted to language study, and the next six were for medical school.</p>
        <p>The Khami Road Clinic is the only sexually transmitted disease center in Bulawayo, and Dr. Nkomo runs it. Its pale green waiting rooms overflow with people waiting quietly for help. There is only one doctor and few major drugs, but the clinic is clean, efficient and well lighted.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nkomo can see 130 people a day, although most days he sees far fewer. Sexually transmitted diseases have long been taken as the best marker for the prevalence of H.I.V. In addition to being a sign of risky sexual behavior, the diseases themselves often make it far easier for someone to become infected.</p>
        <p>Last year 70 percent of the patients tested in one sexually transmitted disease clinic in Harare, the capital, were infected with H.I.V. No similar study has been conducted here, but Dr. Nkomo assumes that the figures cannot be much different.</p>
        <p>''You have to assume that almost everybody who walks in the door is going to get AIDS,'' he said. ''But you can't dwell on it. Because if you do, then you just walk out and go home for good.''</p>
        <p>He has no intention of doing that. A thin man with a wispy string of beard, he manages to be both an optimist and a realist.</p>
        <p>He will see a variety of people: a boy with a broken ankle, a woman with a skin rash and a man with a strange swelling in his feet. One woman comes in with elevated blood pressure, but Dr. Nkomo will be able to do little for her, because no drugs are available at the moment for her condition.</p>
        <p>Most basic medicines are usually available, but it takes aggressive pharmacists, luck and good connections to keep a well-stocked clinic. At the moment, there is no aspirin, no acyclovir -- for treatment of herpes, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections -- and penicillin will not be in until the afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I want more drugs, and I want donors to help buy them for us,'' Dr. Nkomo said. He has recently returned from three months' work at a clinic in Liverpool, and it pains him greatly to see how easily most of his clients could be treated.</p>
        <p>''Why shouldn't we want to treat AIDS?'' he asks. ''What kind of doctor would I be if I sat here quietly and watched everyone in England taking drugs that will save their lives and knowing that we are all going to die?''</p>
        <p>A 23-year-old man comes into the office. He is shy, embarrassed and silent.</p>
        <p>''You got to tell me what's bothering you if I'm going to treat it,'' Dr. Nkomo said, quietly. ''That's what I am here for.''</p>
        <p>The patient has reason to believe that he has a sexually transmitted disease, and on examination it is clear that he is right.</p>
        <p>''When did you last meet someone?'' the doctor asked, using a common euphemism here for having sex. The answer was the previous week.</p>
        <p>''Did you use a condom?'' he asked. The answer was a quiet no.</p>
        <p>''Is she your regular partner?'' he continued. No again. ''When did you meet someone before her?'' The week before. The same questions followed, with the same answers.</p>
        <p>''Do you know about AIDS?'' he asked. Yes, the patient replied, dazed but slightly angry. ''Don't you care?'' Dr. Nkomo asked, his voice rising sharply. ''Do you want to die?'' Of course not, the patient replied. Sometimes he just forgets.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nkomo gives the man a lecture and tells him that condoms are always free at his clinic. He shows him how to use the condoms -- there is a wooden pole on his desk for demonstrations. And he warns the young man that sex these days is not a game.</p>
        <p>As soon as the patient is gone, Dr. Nkomo slams his hands on the desk.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes this is so painful,'' he whispered. ''What can I do for these people? I want to be out there fighting or them. Most of the time I believe we will turn the tide. But sometimes I ask myself if we are all just going to disappear.''</p>
        <p>The Ailing Nurse  Never Tested, But She Knows</p>
        <p>Mildred passes for what is considered middle class in this part of Africa. She is a highly trained nurse who earns about $100 a month, but recently she became too sick to work. She has fevers, headaches and no appetite. Her husband, who has spent his life working on the railroads, seems healthy, and neither has taken an AIDS test.</p>
        <p>For a month she and her husband have been on a drug hunt, desperately trying to find a way to acquire enough antiretroviral medicine to keep her alive. They have three children and live in a lovely brick house in a suburb of Bulawayo that once was dominated by the whites who ruled the country.</p>
        <p>When asked how she had become infected, she replied at first that she was not infected. When pressed, she conceded that she must be. ''I can't explain it,'' she said, fighting back the tears. ''I can't explain it at all. I never had any extra love. I have always worked hard. I don't deserve to die, and I know I don't have to.''</p>
        <p>There are many drugs in Zimbabwe to treat the secondary infections caused by AIDS. But the latest therapies to treat the virus itself are not available, and very few people could afford them if they were. So this couple recently went to South Africa to see if they could buy a stay of execution.</p>
        <p>''We got to a clinic, and the doctor told us it would be about $1,000 a month for the drugs,'' the husband said, moaning softly. ''That was some sort of discount price.</p>
        <p>''I make $200 a month. We could afford the drugs for maybe one month or two. And that is nothing. It would only make us poor. So we are waiting now for God to help us. We are hoping God will help us all.''</p>

        <p>Later articles will report on other aspects of AIDS in Africa, and then on other continents.</p>
