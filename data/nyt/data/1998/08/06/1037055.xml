        <p>ATTENTION Jewish mothers: If you could program your daughter's life, which of the following options would you choose?</p>
        <p>A) Grow up in San Clemente, Calif.; graduate from Lewis and Clark College; earn a master's degree in comparative literature at the University of California at Santa Cruz; write articles and essays for The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Boston Phoenix and Utne Reader; teach writing in Antioch University's Master of Fine Arts program, and write books.</p>
        <p>B) Become a cleaning lady.</p>
        <p>Not much of a choice, you say? Well, what if she did both?</p>
        <p>Louise Rafkin has. She is the author of ''Other People's Dirt: A Housecleaner's Curious Adventures'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1998), and for eight years she has supported her writing career by cleaning houses -- with her eyes wide open and a notebook by her side. She knows when you've been bad or good -- bad when you leave your toenail clippings lying around, very bad for firing her the day she left two Cheerios in the sink. With an anthropologist's eye she can look at an unmade bed or the contents of a garbage can and tell you a person's life story.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I'm a modern-day Margaret Mead,'' she said. ''I just don't have the money to get to the South Seas.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rafkin, who is 40, did get to New York recently from her home outside San Francisco. True to the dual nature of her life, she arrived at the SoHo Grand Hotel ready to analyze the detritus from three recently departed visitors, before relaxing into Part Two, being interviewed in the hotel dining room while reclining on a banquette eating lobster salad.</p>
        <p>First things first. She burst into the lobby a bit late, a whirl of movement amid the black-clad clientele posed on the furniture. She wore white overalls, a flowered shirt and red sneakers, looking like an exceptionally hip plumber.</p>
        <p>Accompanied by two members of the hotel staff, one from housekeeping, she entered the first room, which appeared to have been hit by the proverbial hurricane. ''I would feel embarrassed to leave a room like this,'' Ms. Rafkin exclaimed. ''They'd have my name on the register. They would know who I am.''</p>
        <p>She took a look around. ''It was a woman,'' she said, noting the blow-dryer still plugged into the wall and a bottle of Finesse hair spray left behind. A package of Dunhills lay next to the bed. ''There are only two gone,'' she said. ''Her husband doesn't want her to smoke, so she left the box here.''</p>
        <p>She peered into one of the wastebaskets. ''Red lipstick lady,'' she said, surveying a butt. She sorted through some slips of paper on the desk. ''I'll just take these receipts and put them on my expense account,'' she said jokingly.</p>
        <p>Holding up a Trish McEvoy bottle, Ms. Rafkin continued: ''She's probably at least 40, and the alpha-hydroxy moment has hit her. And look, more dental floss. She also threw out a really expensive toothbrush she bothered to bring here and left a wooden-handled razor.''</p>
        <p>She reached inside the third trash basket. ''I did just touch dental floss,'' she said with a note of doom. She also found a receipt for a skirt that cost $225, and another for a $350 coat. ''If we were evil and mean people, we could run their Amex through, take their numbers and mess up people's lives,'' she said of her colleagues, making that more recent household menace, the nanny, seem suddenly benign. ''But we don't,'' she said reassuringly. ''We're just intrigued by them.''</p>
        <p>The second room was pristine by comparison. A penny lay on the floor, tails side up. The housekeeping-staff member turned it over so the head was up, transforming it into a good luck charm for the next person. Ms. Rafkin smiled in recognition; she has had her own moments tangling with fate. In her book she writes of the time she found a love letter taped to the back of a picture frame, unsealed and addressed to a man she vaguely knew. It was a confession of love from another man who had previously lived in the house but had long since left town.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't imagine how the letter had come to be stuck to the back of the picture, or why it was there,'' she writes. At the end of the letter, the man concluded: ''I hope someone will send this. I am not brave enough to accept my passion.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rafkin mailed it. ''Sometimes I want my presence in a house to have an effect beyond that of a well-mopped floor,'' she writes.</p>
        <p>Does she know what happened? No, she said as she headed to the next room, smiling, seeming perfectly content at not knowing the outcome. It is odd to realize that sometimes fate can be no more cosmic than the cleaning lady's mailing a letter or turning a bad penny into a good one on impulse. Suddenly that person with the keys to your house, the one upon whom you graciously bestow your old magazines, takes on a different dimension.</p>
        <p>''There's an old saying,'' Ms. Rafkin writes. ''A servant is a master in disguise.''</p>
        <p>''But the masters don't know it,'' she said, when reminded of the line. ''That's the curious part.''</p>
        <p>The third room was the male equivalent of the first. Wet towels were strewn across the floor with faxes and magazines. ''He ate the trail mix and had the tomato juice,'' Ms. Rafkin noted, familiar by now with the contents of the mini-bar. He also left a wad of red chewing gum on top of it. She wrinkled her nose and walked to the desk.</p>
        <p>''Look, he left all his change,'' she said, eyeing the pile. ''He doesn't like nickels and pennies. They're for the little people.'' In the trash, she found a schedule of telephone calls and discovered he was an executive at a television network. She asked the hotel staff members' permission to take the People magazine he left behind, and they said yes. As she picked it up, she also slipped the man's business card into her overalls pocket. They didn't notice.</p>
        <p>Her analysis finished, she headed for the dining room. Has she considered her cleaning future, now that her employers, current and prospective, will discover her penchant for playing Harriet the Spy?</p>
        <p>She nodded, expecting the question. Part of her trip has included a visit to Provincetown, Mass., where she lived for nine years before moving west last fall. ''I went the other day to clean to see if I still enjoy it, and I do,'' she said. ''I like to work. Writing takes so long, and it's so un-task-oriented. I would love to be able not to work, not so I could write, but so I could play around.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rafkin said that her housecleaning fees range from $20 to $50 an hour. Last fall she taught a writing class at the City College of San Francisco, for which she was paid $15 an hour. Doing less menial labor than cleaning -- say, working in a bookstore -- pays $7 an hour. ''I could not live on $7 an hour,'' she said flatly. ''I'd have one latte and be done for the hour. I wanted to write this book to show what artists have to do and who they actually are.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Ms. Rafkin did a reading in Provincetown of some of her writing on cleaning. ''The audience was the cleaned-for and the cleaners, the artists and the patrons of the arts with nothing keeping them apart,'' she said. ''It was almost like seeing a light bulb, the way the one started looking at the other. Now they see us, I thought, and it started me thinking about a book.''</p>
        <p>Many artists wait tables, of course, and Ms. Rafkin has, too. ''For years,'' she said. ''Chez Panisse offered me a job. They have a wine list with 200 wines I'd have to learn. Do I care if something is woodsy?'' She made a face.</p>
        <p>Instead, she has found another line of work she actually enjoys: cater waitering. ''Every event has a story,'' she said. ''At one wedding the old girlfriend showed up, and the bride threw her veil out the window. It was great. My personal life is so unexciting by comparison. I'm working on a piece now called, 'Always a Cater Waiter, Never a Bride.' You walk away with a wad of dough and a story.''</p>
        <p>There is nothing in Ms. Rafkin's own story that would have foreshadowed her life's taking such an unexpected turn. Named Kathy Louise Rafkin at birth, she dropped her first name during college registration. ''I had never heard of a writer named Kathy: that was my cheerleading name,'' she said. ''We were not rich growing up,'' she went on, though her parents employed a cleaning lady like everyone else in their San Clemente neighborhood. Her father was a part-time pharmacist and died when she was 17. Her mother became a marine ecologist, and at 77 she is still working.</p>
        <p>In the course of writing ''Other People's Dirt,'' Ms. Rafkin returned to California to talk to her own family's Mexican housekeeper, who made no effort to hide her dismay at Ms. Rafkin's choice of employment.</p>
        <p>''That American dream thing was her life,'' Ms. Rafkin said easily. ''Her son became a policeman. They wanted to assimilate, do what was expected. For her, it was not an easy life. But I'm making free money to live another life.''</p>
        <p>Part of which is writing about mess as metaphor, a subject she warms to. ''Being messy is human,'' she said. ''The more people there are in your life, the bigger the mess.''</p>
        <p>Which also goes for pets, she said, including her own dog, Lucy. ''If I didn't have her, I wouldn't have to vacuum every day, but then I wouldn't have Lucy. People I know with the cleanest houses, it's a sad, sad thing. But that's their choice. No mess, no love, no people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rafkin decided against telling most of her cleaning clients about her writing career. ''That was the challenge,'' she said, ''being in these houses, never being asked anything, not even my name. There was that ego moment, sure, but then I would think, Does it really matter if they know?'' As for the few people she refers to by nickname in the book, she said plainly, ''I doubt they would recognize themselves.''</p>
        <p>Did she set any boundaries when it came to privacy? ''I saw journals and never read them,'' she said. ''I don't do that. But once I taped together a breakup note from the trash. They had been married 30 years, and it was a very beautiful human artifact that would be thrown away otherwise. It's not like I did it to show my friends.''</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the final question of the day: What exactly was she planning to do with that television executive's business card? Will she call him?</p>
        <p>She colored slightly, and shook her head. ''I would never do that, because I could get the housekeepers at the hotel in trouble,'' she said. ''But I have friends who are getting into show business now, so I thought I'd tell them his name and see if maybe they've heard of him.'' She shrugged, and smiled in spite of herself. ''I'd just like to know.''</p>
