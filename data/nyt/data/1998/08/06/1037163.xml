        <p>It was a drug bust gone bust.</p>
        <p>More than 100 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and detectives from the Ninth Precinct pried their way into the Hell's Angels clubhouse in the East Village last night, working on a tip that narcotics were being sold in the motorcycle club.</p>
        <p>But when the authorities arrived, they found no illegal drugs -- nothing illegal, in fact, except a pair of unregistered handguns, they said.</p>
        <p>''All they had to do was knock,'' one gang member said.</p>
        <p>Four members were arrested: one on an assault charge, two on outstanding robbery charges, and another on a charge of criminal possession of the weapons, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The clubhouse at 75 1/2 East Third Street -- actually incorporated under New York State law as a religious nonprofit organization and formally known as the Church of Angels -- has been at that address for three decades.</p>
        <p>Last night, as the police had the block cordoned off for the raid, Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer who has defended some gang members before, denounced the raid as harassment and said the authorities were running a ''police state.''</p>
        <p>Neighbors insisted that the bikers kept the area clean and sober.</p>
        <p>''They're good neighbors,'' said Caren Goldstein, 32. ''They're very peaceful and they protect the block. I feel safe here.''</p>
