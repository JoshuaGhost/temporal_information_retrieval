        <p>PAT ZAGARIA was at the helm as the sailboat headed out from a Toms River marina and into Barnegat Bay. Once an avid sailor, Zagaria has been forced to curtail his outings because of a disabling illness.</p>
        <p>But not on this day, as the sailboat he piloted joined a small flotilla taking part in an outing sponsored by the group Sail-Habilitation.</p>
        <p>The program, run by volunteers from both the local recreational sailing community and those working in rehabilitation of the disabled, promotes the physical-fitness and  recreational benefits of sailing as part of the rehabilitation process.</p>
        <p>Sailing programs on different levels, from introductory recreational sails to competitive racing, are offered by the program, which was cited for its achievements by Governor Whitman last year.</p>
        <p>At the outing last week, one of  Sail-Habilitation's Community Sailing Days, Chris Calavano, brought Guy Blair to the boat where he joined Walter Jasinski, who received help with a life preserver from David Crapnell. Also on board the 24-foot boat, which was donated to the group and is run exclusively by the program, was Joe Herbert, a volunteer crewman. Out in the bay, Marvin Dupree took the tiller.</p>
        <p>Back on shore, Michael Corcione waited by the grill as lunch was about to be served at a picnic held for the sailors at Dillon's Creek Marina in Island Park. The program runs out of the marina, which is equipped with ramps to make it fully accessible to the handicapped.</p>
