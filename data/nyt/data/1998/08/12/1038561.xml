        <p>Colorado Democrats chose women today as their candidates for two significant races this fall: Dottie Lamm, a former newspaper columnist and wife of a former governor, for senator and Gail Schoettler, the Lieutenant Governor, for governor.</p>
        <p>Republican voters largely rejected right-wing candidates, endorsing Ben Nighthorse Campbell to run again for the Senate and choosing Bill Owens, the state treasurer, to run for governor.</p>
        <p>The Senate seat is an open one. Colorado's Governor, Roy Romer, is barred from running for a fourth term because of term limits.</p>
        <p>With most precincts reporting, Mr. Campbell, 65, running in his first Republican race since he switched from the Democratic Party in 1995, had 70 percent of the vote, to 30 percent for Bill Eggert, a Denver lawyer who is himself a former Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lamm, wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm, had 57 percent of the vote against State Representative Gil Romero, with 43 percent.</p>
        <p>In the races for governor, Mr. Owens had 59 percent of the vote in the Republican primary against Tom Norton, the State Senate president. On the Democratic side, Ms. Schoettler had 55 percent, to 45 percent for Mike Feeley, the State Senate minority leader.</p>
        <p>Colorado's primaries brought several new faces to the fore. Mark Udall, son of former Congressman Morris Udall, will be the Democrats' candidate to represent the district encompassing Boulder in Congress.  Republicans, seeking to break a 24-year Democratic lock on the district, chose Bob Greenlee, a moderate who is Boulder's first Republican Mayor in recent memory.</p>
        <p>Reflecting a fund-raising dichotomy, the winners had raised enough money to buy television advertisements. The losers, on tighter budgets, bought radio advertisements.</p>
        <p>In the general election, Democrats face a disadvantage in statewide races. Republicans are a growing presence in Colorado and have a registration edge of 5 percent, or 120,000 votes, over the Democrats.</p>
        <p>With Republicans controlling the State Legislature, Democrats argue that the election of a Democratic governor is the only way to stop Colorado from following its neighbors into ''one party'' status. In Kansas, Wyoming and Utah, Republicans control both the legislatures and governorships. Colorado has had a Democratic governor since 1975.</p>
        <p>Today's election was also stamped by the impact of Colorado's term limits laws. Twenty-five members of the Legislature sought to extend their political careers by running for new offices.</p>
        <p>In a reflection of the significant migration into Colorado, natives of New York and natives of California outnumbered natives of Colorado in the pool of eight candidates for the two top offices today -- senator and governor. The lone Colorado native was Mr. Romero, of Pueblo. In the Senate race, Ms. Lamm and Mr. Eggert are natives of the Bronx.</p>
