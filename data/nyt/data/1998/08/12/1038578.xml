        <p>Representative Christopher H. Smith said he would travel to Myanmar today to push for the release of a New Jersey college student arrested there on Sunday for distributing pro-democracy pamphlets.</p>
        <p>The student, Michelle Keegan, 19, of Hamilton Township, was taken into custody with 17 other foreigners, including 5 other Americans, in Yangon, the capital city, for distributing literature the government said was intended to incite unrest.</p>
        <p>A State Department official said yesterday that a top American diplomat in Myanmar visited the American detainees and reported that they were in good condition.. Mr. Smith said that Ms. Keegan, who was to be a sophomore this fall at American University in Washington, traveled to Yangon to help commemorate the 10th anniversary of a violent government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.</p>
        <p>The Congressman, a Republican from Washington Township who chairs the House Subcommittee on International Relations and Human Rights, said he was asked to intervene by Ms. Keegan's father, a Trenton police officer.</p>
