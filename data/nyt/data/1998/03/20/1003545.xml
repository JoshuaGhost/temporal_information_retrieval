        <p>Steven Strauss letter sees parallel between Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas case and Kathleen Willey's relationship with Pres Clinton, observing that both women were concerned with protecting their work situation</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill explained her continued contact with Judge Thomas after his alleged sexual harassment of her as motivated by concerns about her career (column, March 18). In order to protect her career, Ms. Hill claimed, she could not have offended Judge Thomas. This explanation was widely accepted, despite the fact that Ms. Thomas was a well-qualified professional.</p>

        <p>Kathleen Willey is a widow without a college degree. The tone of her letters to President Clinton is that of a weak person desperately begging for support. If Ms. Hill's explanation was credible, Ms. Willey's is even more so.</p>
