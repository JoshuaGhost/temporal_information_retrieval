        <p>Jess A Velona letter contends Kathleen Willey's assertions took courage to make, even if they were not truthful</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The commentary on Kathleen E. Willey (news articles, March 16, 17) has not stressed the personal risk she took. She told a story under oath and in public that effectively accuses the President of sexual misconduct and perjury. Ms. Willey did so knowing it would be her word against that of the President and his spin operation.</p>
        <p>She had to know that every aspect of her apparently difficult private life would be unearthed by the White House and the media. She must have known, too, that most of her political friends would leave her to face this trial by fire essentially alone.</p>

        <p>Yes, Ms. Willey may not be truthful and her motive may be improper. But this may also be an act of courage -- a quality in short supply in Washington.</p>
