        <p>IN a feat of competitive catch-up, the General Motors Corporation says it has cut the the time it takes to design and build new cars and trucks by six months. Further, it promises another six-month improvement by the end of this year, matching its domestic competitors.</p>
        <p>G.M. executives have confirmed that the company moved a new vehicle concept from the design studio to the factory floor in just 30 months, beating its previous record of 36 months. And G.M. says it will soon match its smaller American rivals, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, with a 24-month development cycle.</p>

        <p>IN a feat of competitive catch-up, the General Motors Corporation says it has cut the the time it takes to design and build new cars and trucks by six months. Further, it promises another six-month improvement by the end of this year, matching its domestic competitors.</p>
        <p>G.M. executives have confirmed that the company moved a new vehicle concept from the design studio to the factory floor in just 30 months, beating its previous record of 36 months. And G.M. says it will soon match its smaller American rivals, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, with a 24-month development cycle.</p>
        <p>Every auto company is trying to speed up the development process to respond faster to changes in consumer tastes and demand. For G.M., which has long been the laggard in product development, as well as the most inefficient auto producer, the quicker cycle demonstrates that the company's global restructuring and investments in new technology are starting to pay off. The company would not disclose the development times for any specific vehicles.</p>
        <p>''We are not stopping at 24 months,'' said William G. Poulos, a director of G.M.'s vehicle development process center in Detroit. ''We will continue to look for ways to take time out'' of product development.</p>
        <p>The first G.M. cars built for the United States market on the 30-month cycle will be introduced next year, Mr. Poulos said. Although he would not identify the models, the company is expected to bring out in late 1999 an all-new Pontiac Bonneville and Buick LeSabre, as well as a new Chevrolet Impala (which replaces the Lumina) and Monte Carlo, according to J. D. Power &amp; Associates, an automotive consulting firm.</p>
        <p>While G.M. is making progress, the company remains far behind Japanese competitors. The Toyota Motor Corporation, for example, designed and started building the new Lexus RX 300 sport utility vehicle, which went on sale two weeks ago, in just 18 months. And Toyota's chairman has set a new-product goal of just 14 months.</p>
        <p>Some analysts are also skeptical that G.M. can deliver on its promises.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter if your product cycle is that fast, if you can't make a decision about what to build,'' said Michael L. Schmall, managing director of Planning Edge, a consulting firm in Troy, Mich. ''They are just so late to the market. The company keeps telling us how wonderful everything is, and their market share keeps going down.''</p>
        <p>Nearly everyone in the industry agrees that faster development times provide a critical advantage. The speedup is good news for consumers, who won't have to wait the traditional four or five years for a new car or truck design. For the companies, the results are mixed. Shaving time off the development cycle saves money, but big profits from a hot-selling model can soon be siphoned away by a quick competitor that rushes out a similar product. As a result, auto makers are trying harder to shield future products from rivals' spying eyes.</p>
        <p>The chairman of G.M., John F. Smith Jr., told Wall Street analysts this month that the company may have blundered by showing a prototype of a European-market mini-van, the Opel Zefira, at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September, a year before the van was to go into production.</p>
        <p>In a recent meeting with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Smith said his ''concern was that they've given the competition, including Ford and others, a lot of lead time,'' said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto stock analyst for Lehman Brothers. Mr. Smith conceded that if G.M.'s competitors scrambled, ''We will only have six to nine months on the market before they answer our product.''</p>
        <p>For G.M. and most other auto makers, the key to saving time has been a switch to computer-aided design and holographic models from paper-and-ink drawings and clay models. Now, companies can make more design changes, and they can make them faster. Computer designs are also more precise than hand-crafted models. A more accurate and complete design means fewer costly, last-minute changes to equipment in production plants.</p>
        <p>''You can actually deliver a higher-quality, lower-cost product with a more effective development process,'' Mr. Poulos said. He estimated that reducing the cycle to 30 months shaved about 12 percent off the cost of developing a new vehicle, which translates into tens of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>G.M. has also tried to speed the process by harmonizing designs among subsidiaries in different countries. For example, it plans to introduce small cars based on a single platform around the world starting in 2000, analysts say.</p>
        <p>''Shortening the development cycle is important because there is a lot more input from other organizations in other regions,'' said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an auto-industry consulting firm in Southfield, Mich.</p>
        <p>G.M. has also eliminated layers of management that delay decisions by consolidating divisions and putting one person, known as a vehicle line executive, in charge of taking a new design to the factory floor. ''It's getting better,'' said Mr. Phillippi of Lehman Brothers. But there is ''still too much of a bureaucratic labyrinth products have to wind their way through.''</p>
