        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with your comment that we ''know so little about what kind of man Bill Clinton really is'' (editorial, March 17). Everyone knows exactly what kind of man he is. What we are wrestling with is whether we are willing to overlook this. The sad part about the reporting on the President's character is that we are constantly being told that he's only human, so what's the big deal?</p>

        <p>I do not care if President Clinton has been unfaithful to his spouse. What I care about is that three people have called him a liar. Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, should at least be given the same benefit of the doubt as the President.</p>
