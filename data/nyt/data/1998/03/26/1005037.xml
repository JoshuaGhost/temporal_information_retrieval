        <p>A Federal judge who will sentence Terry L. Nichols in the Oklahoma City bombing said today that he would consider some leniency if Mr. Nichols helped the Government learn more about the conspiracy.</p>
        <p>''It would be disappointing to me,'' said the judge, Richard P. Matsch of District Court her, ''if Federal law-enforcement officers have quit looking for answers in the Oklahoma bombing tragedy.''</p>

        <p>A Federal judge who will sentence Terry L. Nichols in the Oklahoma City bombing said today that he would consider some leniency if Mr. Nichols helped the Government learn more about the conspiracy.</p>
        <p>''It would be disappointing to me,'' said the judge, Richard P. Matsch of District Court her, ''if Federal law-enforcement officers have quit looking for answers in the Oklahoma bombing tragedy.''</p>
        <p>The lead prosecutor, Larry A. Mackey, said, ''We continue to look.''</p>
        <p>But Michael E. Tigar, Mr. Nichols's chief lawyer, pointed out that his client still faces a state murder investigation in Oklahoma and ''whatever he says falls into hands that do not have his best interests at heart.''</p>
        <p>Some members of the jury, which convicted Mr. Nichols of conspiracy and manslaughter but acquitted him of murder and the bombing, said they believed that evidence of a wider conspiracy had not been pursued.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nichols's co-defendant, Timothy J. McVeigh, who was tried separately, has been sentenced to death on murder, conspiracy and bombing charges in the blast, which killed 168 people. The jury that convicted Mr. Nichols could not agree that he intended to kill, sparing his life and handing Judge Matsch the sentencing decision.</p>
        <p>Judge Matsch said he believed that Federal guidelines called for a life sentence for Mr. Nichols, but that he would consider a lesser term at a hearing to be scheduled.</p>
        <p>The judge said this afternoon that he had planned a sentencing hearing for April 17 but postponed that indefinitely after lawyers for the bombing victims raised the issue of restitution for the first time, saying today that they did not want Mr. Nichols to profit from any future book or money-making venture connected with the case.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Government also said they wanted to take up the issue of how much of Mr. Nichols's property and how much of his future pay in prison should be given to the Government for its losses.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Nichols cannot afford to pay $32 million to put the building back up,'' Mr. Tigar retorted angrily, saying that was ''beyond the power of any prisoner to earn in a lifetime.''</p>
        <p>Judge Matsch responded, ''I didn't anticipate a quarrel over restitution,'' then added, ''you want to have a big fight about restitution, we'll do it. But it will hold things up.'' He ordered prosecutors to file briefs on restitution by April 6 and gave lawyers for Mr. Nichols until April 20 to respond.</p>
        <p>Today, Judge Matsch granted a request from Marsha Kight, who lost her daughter in the bombing, and Martin Cash, who lost an eye in the bombing, that victims be allowed to make statements at the sentencing hearing.</p>
        <p>Although the judge said some 2,500 people might be eligible under the  law to speak, Paul G. Cassell, the victims' lawyer, said only 12 have responded to queries from the Government and have asked to appear. Each would speak about 10 minutes. Judge Matsch said that victims who want to speak must notify him at least 10 days before the hearing.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Nichols had one victory today as Judge Matsch granted their request to see 12,000 notes handwritten by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who took calls from the public. Prosecutors had objected, saying there was nothing in these documents that might exculpate Mr. Nichols.</p>
        <p>Judge Matsch ordered prosecutors to hand over these documents as soon as possible but said they could  block out portions that showed how the agents followed up on the tips.</p>
