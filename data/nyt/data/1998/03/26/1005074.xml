        <p>After a three-hour meeting at a lakeside hotel here, President Clinton secured a commitment from six East African leaders today to work toward building more democratic governments in their countries and to prevent genocide in this strife-torn region.</p>
        <p>But beyond vague pledges about regional cooperation, a communique issued by the leaders was short on details about how a raft of lofty sounding goals, including protecting human rights and expanding trade, would be accomplished. On democracy, for instance, the agreement contains several loopholes and caveats that would allow one-party systems, like the one in Uganda, to continue.</p>
        <p>The six African leaders pledged only to ''pursue a dialogue on democratization'' that ''recognizes there is no fixed model for democratic institutions'' and ''explores alternative approaches to the democratic management of cultural diversity,'' according to the communique.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said: ''America knows from our own experience that there is no single blueprint for a successful democracy. We're still working in our country to create what our founders called a more perfect union.''</p>
        <p>The meeting was the culmination of Mr. Clinton's two-day visit to Uganda, the second country in his tour of Africa to promote a new American policy toward the continent, which Mr. Clinton's aides say would stress trade and investment.</p>
        <p>The meeting came just hours after the President visited neighboring Rwanda and gave a moving address in which he said the United States had not done enough to stop the genocide there in 1994, in which more than a half-million Tutsi people were killed by Hutu militias.</p>
        <p>In their communique, the seven leaders promised to prevent massacres, among other things, denying safe havens to political extremists who advocate genocide.</p>
        <p>''We have agreed to work together to banish genocide from this region,'' Mr. Clinton said after signing the communique. ''Our efforts come too late for yesterday's victims. They must be in time to prevent tomorrow's victims.''</p>
        <p>The agreement was signed by the United States, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Congo (the former Zaire) and Ethiopia, as well as an envoy from the Organization of African Unity. In the talks Mr. Clinton held out the possibility that he would support more debt relief for East African countries and promised to restore direct American aid to Africa to its historically high level of about $813 million a year, said Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton also made it clear that in return the United States expected economic and political changes that would insure human rights, expand their democracies and create a stable environment for investors, Mr. Berger said.</p>
