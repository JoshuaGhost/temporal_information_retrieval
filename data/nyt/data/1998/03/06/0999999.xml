        <p>The Full Monty</p>
        <p>To generate income and recover self-esteem, a group of unemployed steel workers in Sheffield, England, decide to strip naked in front of a club full of wildly cheering women who usually fling good amounts of money at male dancers. All of them, including Gaz (Robert Carlyle, above), work hard and awkwardly to develop a routine. ''I'll bet even Madonna has difficulty getting her shoes and socks off,'' one says. Gradually and painfully the act comes together in Peter Cattaneo's Oscar-nominated film, whose hunk-free cast, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''gives it loads of nonchalant humor, serious social underpinnings and a wonderfully incongruous edge.''</p>
        <p>1997. Fox. $104.16. Laser disk, $39.98. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.</p>

        <p>The Full Monty</p>
        <p>To generate income and recover self-esteem, a group of unemployed steel workers in Sheffield, England, decide to strip naked in front of a club full of wildly cheering women who usually fling good amounts of money at male dancers. All of them, including Gaz (Robert Carlyle, above), work hard and awkwardly to develop a routine. ''I'll bet even Madonna has difficulty getting her shoes and socks off,'' one says. Gradually and painfully the act comes together in Peter Cattaneo's Oscar-nominated film, whose hunk-free cast, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''gives it loads of nonchalant humor, serious social underpinnings and a wonderfully incongruous edge.''</p>
        <p>1997. Fox. $104.16. Laser disk, $39.98. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In and Out</p>
        <p>Gathered to watch the Academy Awards show, Howard (Kevin Kline), his fiancee (Joan Cusack, who has been nominated a for best supporting actress Oscar) and everybody else in the town where he's a high-school teacher is thrilled to hear him praised by an actor and former student of his who has just won an Oscar. And, the actor announces to the billion or so viewers, Howard is gay. The rest of Frank Oz's film deals with the consequences of the revelation in a ''frequently funny but surprisingly strait-laced comedy, one that too often imagines homosexuality as a taste for bow ties and a reverence for a certain movie queen'' (Maslin).</p>
        <p>1997. Paramount. $105.96. Laser disk, $34.98. 92 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.</p>
        <p>A Life Less Ordinary</p>
        <p>Danny Boyle's film mixes romantic fluff and rough stuff played for laughs. When a janitor named Robert (Ewan McGregor) kidnaps Celine (Cameron Diaz), the boss's daughter, the captive proves far more suited to a life of crime than the abductor. Sent to earth to bring the pair together romantically, two angel police officers (Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter) get banged around and shot. As for romance, little heat develops between Robert and the abrasive Celine in a film that ''comes with a strange and whimsical mean streak'' (Janet Maslin).</p>
        <p>1997. Fox. $104.16. Laser disk, $39.98. 103 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Peacemaker</p>
        <p>Everybody moves fast when terrorists make off with a trainload of Russian nuclear devices. Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman), a specialist in missing nuclear materials, is very brisk, and Lieut. Col. Thomas Devoe (George Clooney), an intelligence officer, is very suave. Later an otherwise sensitive Bosnian piano teacher tries to take out New York with a homemade nuke in a thriller directed with ''crisp economy and furious energy'' (Maslin).</p>
        <p>1997. Universal. Laser disk, $39.98. 124 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.</p>
