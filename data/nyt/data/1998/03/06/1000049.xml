        <p>In a smoothly scripted bailout of Japan's financial system, 21 big banks submitted applications for public funds today, a move the Government hopes will ultimately help restore worldwide confidence in Japanese banks.</p>
        <p>The drama, however, was interrupted by a discordant note: the arrest this afternoon of two Finance Ministry officials for accepting entertainment from bankers and brokers. It was the second time in just over a month that Finance Ministry officials have been arrested for taking bribes, and the arrests underscored the regulatory weaknesses that have contributed to the confidence problem.</p>
        <p>As part of a $238 billion bailout plan, the Government is spending money to buy securities issued by the banks to raise their capital strength, stabilize the financial system and help ease a credit shortage that has hurt bank lending.</p>
        <p>The banks are issuing either preferred shares, which carry no voting rights, or subordinated bonds, which carry fewer creditor rights than other bonds.</p>
        <p>It is an American-style bailout, modeled after the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the 1930's, when the Government bought shares in banks to help end the Depression.</p>
        <p>Analysts say, however, that the Japanese bailout does not directly confront the problem of the estimated $600 billion in bad or questionable loans carried by the banks. Nor does it address the underlying problem created by Japan's glut of banks, which means some may have to fail to guarantee profits for the rest.</p>
        <p>Banks originally reluctant to take public funds were apparently encouraged to do so by the Government, which feared that if only weak banks applied, their depositors might get nervous and close accounts.  Some critics said the participation of all banks in the bailout reflected the continuing emphasis on a convoy system, in which all banks move together only as fast as the slowest.</p>
        <p>Altogether, the banks applied for 2.1 trillion yen, or about $16.7 billion. But nearly all the major banks applied for the same amount -- 100 billion yen, or about $794 million. All submitted similar restructuring plans.</p>
        <p>''The whole scheme seems to be more of a political maneuver to boost sentiment rather than an earnest effort to improve the banking system,'' said James P. Fiorello, banking analyst at ING Barings Securities (Japan) Ltd.</p>
        <p>The exceptions were Nippon Credit Bank, which is seeking up to 300 billion yen, and Long Term Credit Bank, seeking 200 billion yen.</p>
        <p>Government officials defended the plan, saying it was meant to stabilize the financial system, regardless of whether it appeared to be a return to tradition.</p>
        <p>''The ultimate goal for the scheme is to make the Japanese financial system more efficient and internationally competitive,'' said Takayoshi Hatayama, deputy head of the committee at the Deposit Insurance Corporation that is overseeing the disbursement of public funds.</p>
        <p>Most banks were reluctant to issue preferred shares and allow the Government to take a stake, for fear the Government would interfere in management of their operations. Indeed, several banks are issuing preferred shares in New York, a move regarded as a slight against the Government and an effort by strong banks to show they can raise money on their own without having to turn to the Government.</p>
        <p>All the banks are expected to receive funds by the end of the month.</p>
