        <p>The European Union said today that it would not drop a ban on hormone-treated beef even though two international panels have ruled against it.</p>
        <p>The European Union's move marked a test of wills over enforcing World Trade Organization decisions in disputes. It also rekindled an ideologically charged battle over drugs and food with the United States, which immediately charged that Europe would undermine the authority of the four-year-old international tribunal to settle trade battles.</p>
        <p>At issue is Europe's 10-year-old ban on beef from cattle that have been treated with growth hormones. European countries have adamantly defended the ban, derived from a widespread popular concern in many nations about meat treated with chemicals.  American cattle breeders, who use growth hormones on most cattle, have argued that the ban is a barrier to free trade.</p>
        <p>Last year, in what the Clinton Administration viewed as an important test case for resolving trade disputes over health restrictions, a panel at the World Trade Organization declared the ban illegal because it was not based on scientific evidence. An appellate board upheld that ruling last month and gave the European Union 30 days to present a plan for how it would carry out the ruling.</p>
        <p>But today, the European Union announced that the appellate ruling merely required it to prepare a new risk assessment. In a statement, it also said that it did not have to quantify the risk of hormone-treated beef or ''rely only on the majority or mainstream scientific views.''</p>
        <p>Rita Hayes, the United States Ambassador to the World Trade Organization, denounced the move as an ''unacceptable'' repudiation of a valid international decision.</p>
        <p>''The E.C. has had several opportunities to present scientific evidence to support its ban,'' Ms. Hayes told reporters in Geneva.  ''Yet during the more than 10 years that the ban has been in effect, the E.C. has been unable to produce the required evidence.''</p>
        <p>At stake is more than just American beef exports to Europe, which American cattle executives have said would amount to about $250 million a year if the ban was lifted.</p>
        <p>The beef battle marked the first big foray into the sensitive area of treating health and safety issues as trade disputes. Under a pioneering trade agreement signed by most industrial countries, they agreed that trade restrictions based on concerns about health and safety must be based on scientific evidence.</p>
        <p>The United States seized on the issue of hormone-treated beef, citing conclusions from international health authorities that the hormones given to cattle have no impact on human consumers. But European government leaders, sensitive to widespread popular suspicion of chemicals, argued that the ban was well within their rights to protect consumers.</p>
        <p>The outcome is likely to set precedents in many other disputes in coming years, ranging from imported fruit standards to genetically engineered crops.</p>
        <p>Under the procedures of the World Trade Organization, the European Union was required to inform the tribunal about how it would carry out the recent decisions on hormone-treated beef. The United States argued that Europe should drop the ban promptly.</p>
        <p>American officials and other trade experts said the European Union was seizing on a small detail in last month's decision by the appellate board. They said that European officials were relying on a note by the board that Europe had itself never conducted a scientific risk assessment on hormone-treated beef. Since the ruling, European Commission officials have argued that the ruling would let them keep the ban if they came up with a risk assessment.</p>
        <p>In its statement today, the European Union said it would ''take into account the most recent scientific knowledge,'' adding that ''recent findings indicate there is a need for re-evaluation of the old assessments.''</p>
        <p>International trade rules usually give countries about 15 months to change policies after they lose a case before the World Trade Organization, though arbitrators can adjust the allowed time.</p>
        <p>In Brussels, European officials have said they intend to produce a new risk-assessment study over the next year and use it to argue against lifting the ban.</p>
        <p>In Geneva, officials for the World Trade Organization refused to comment today on whether European officials were on solid ground.</p>
