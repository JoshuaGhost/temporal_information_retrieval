      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By declining to segregate women during basic training, Defense Secretary William Cohen sends the right message that gender integration is vital to the modern military. After several military sex scandals, a special advisory panel convened by Mr. Cohen and headed by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker recommended last December that the Army, Navy and Air Force separate new recruits into single-sex training units and house them in single-sex barracks. The Marines already segregate training by sex.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cohen refused this week to require that approach of all the services. He did ask the services to insure that living quarters be separate, but did not push for separate barracks buildings. The Army, Navy and Air Force chiefs oppose gender segregation for a simple reason. Fourteen percent of the nation's 1.4 million volunteer troops are women, a percentage that is likely to increase. Recruits will eventually have to work with both men and women. Basic training should reflect that reality.</p>

        <p>But Mr. Cohen refused this week to require that approach of all the services.

Recruits will eventually have to work with both men and women. Basic training should reflect that reality.</p>
        <p>The Kassebaum Baker panel recommended several important changes that Mr. Cohen has endorsed. He wants the services to increase the numbers of female recruiters and instructors, improve the method of selection of instructors and provide training to root out sexual harassment. He will also promote tougher physical standards for everyone. In the military as in civilian life, creating a gender barrier is no way to deal with sexual misconduct.</p>
