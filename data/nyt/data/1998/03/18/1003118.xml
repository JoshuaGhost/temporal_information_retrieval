        <p>New Jersey's unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point in February -- to 5 percent -- even as the number of jobs in the state increased by 12,500, the State Department of Labor announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Although the figures may seem contradictory, they are not, said Kevin Smith, a department spokesman. Because the unemployment rate incorporates the number of residents who are both unemployed and seeking jobs, the rate can rise simply because jobless people who had not been looking for work have resumed their search, Mr. Smith said. That is probably what happened in New Jersey last month, he added, due to optimism about the economy.</p>

        <p>The creation of new jobs, although  still a positive economic indicator, may not reduce the unemployment rate, Mr. Smith said, depending on how many of those jobs are filled by unemployed residents seeking work. Last month's new jobs were concentrated in the retail, construction and transportation industries, Mr. Smith said.</p>
