        <p>The Justice Department is seeking to prevent Microsoft from making computer manufacturers load Internet Explorer in new machines. Microsoft says, however, that without Explorer, its Windows 95 operating system and features of other software will not work.</p>
        <p>The reason: when Microsoft upgraded Internet Explorer to version 3.0, it placed some of the program's improved code into files that also contained instructions for operating system functions like drawing windows on screen.</p>
        <p>The new hybrid files, some of which previously existed as part of Windows, became part of Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>Microsoft says that these files -- called dynamic linked libraries -- are part of Internet Explorer because they offer browser functions. Microsoft also says that the libraries are part of the Windows operating system because they control some basic functions.</p>
        <p>In short, Microsoft's position is that Windows and Internet Explorer are not separate products, but an integrated package.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of the program files loaded by Internet Explorer and, for a few key files, a description of what they do.</p>
