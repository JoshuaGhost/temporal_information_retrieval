        <p>Rupert Murdoch already had a $14 billion media conglomerate when he decided that his Fox Television group should buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. But Ted Turner was not a cable news titan or America's Cup winner when he bought the Atlanta Braves in 1976. He was just a brash Southern dervish with a billboard business and a small UHF station.</p>
        <p>Two decades later, however, Mr. Murdoch appears to have seen the value in Mr. Turner's instincts: that owning a sports team can help guarantee cornerstone programming for a television outlet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, whose maverick reputation among baseball owners probably best approximates Mr. Murdoch's, started carrying the Braves in 1974 on WTCG (for ''Watch This Channel Grow''), Atlanta's Channel 17. He expanded its regional appeal by bouncing the signal around the Southeast by microwave. But in 1975, the Braves fell to a 67-94 record and drew 534,672 fans. Fearing his crucial summer programming would abandon him for Toronto, Turner bought the team for $10 million.</p>
        <p>''The station needed programming,'' said Bill Bartholomay, one of the former owners who is still its chairman. ''Buying the team flowed naturally.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner renamed the station WTBS and made a most vital move: he linked the station to a satellite, so any cable system could take it for a small fee. It would become best known as the TBS Superstation.</p>
        <p>''He was able to get the kind of enormous cable ratings that you can't get today,'' said Robert Wussler, a former president of the Turner Broadcasting System. ''We sold the games to Anheuser-Busch and other major sports advertisers. It was real money, and of critical importance.'' In 1977, Mr. Turner bought basketball's Atlanta Hawks and put them on TBS.</p>
        <p>Turner's superstation, which sent Braves games into other teams' markets, provoked a long battle with baseball: dealing with this superstation, ''Bowie Kuhn threatened to use the 'best interests of baseball' clause to stop us, but never did,'' Mr. Wussler said, referring to a former commissioner.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, TBS helped the Braves solidify their place as the self-described ''America's Team.'' In 1982, they won the National League West pennant. Attendance more than tripled to 1.8 million. And TBS was reaching 25 million homes, up from 694,746 six years before.</p>
        <p>But as TBS and its ilk grew more popular nationally -- and teams believed the superstations' encroachment on their markets caused them to lose viewers and advertising -- Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth imposed a tax on the superstations. But the fees have never recaptured the real value of the broadcasts.</p>
        <p>''Ted realized it was time to pay something,'' Mr. Wussler said. ''It was quite de minimus, compared to what the rights were really worth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner provided baseball with other headaches. He hired himself as manager for a game in 1977. He signed the free agent Andy Messer smith for $1 million, assigned him the number 17 and had the name Channel put on the back of his uniform -- advertising for TBS. Mr. Kuhn suspended Turner for a season for tampering in the free agent outfielder Gary Matthews's signing.</p>
        <p>The Braves still constitute crucial programming on TBS, all the more so because they are perennial World Series contenders. TBS is no longer a superstation, having converted last year to a basic cable network in 73.1 million cable households.</p>
        <p>''Ted's always looked at the Braves as both a team and programming, but not one at the expense of another,'' said Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports. ''He loves the game, he follows it, and winning is important to him.''</p>
