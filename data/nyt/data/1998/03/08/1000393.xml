        <p>THE LIFE OF INSECTS</p>
        <p>By Victor Pelevin.</p>
        <p>Translated by Andrew Bromfield.</p>
        <p>179 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $22.</p>
        <p>Political allegory, antic fantasy, willful enigma: Victor Pelevin's latest book to appear in English is a little of all three. Vivid in its essence yet puzzling at times in its detail, this Russian novel is a slippery piece of work -- more so, say, than Pelevin's ''Omon Ra,'' which describes a highly irregular Soviet space-race episode and then spells out the incriminating truths behind it.</p>
        <p>Pelevin withholds any such easy explanations in ''The Life of Insects.'' Instead, as a commentary on a volatile, shape-shifting interval in recent Russian history, the novel constantly shifts shape itself, inducing uncertainties in the reader's mind that are keenly shared by the book's main characters. Indeed, these uncertainties run so deep that they routinely put the characters' very species into doubt, as they seemingly change from moment to moment. With this absurdist approach, Pelevin delves deeply into the illusory lure of political ideology, the sense of loss that occurs when this ideology fails and the way even yearned-for social changes can undermine the essence of individual and collective identity.</p>
        <p>Put in these terms, ''The Life of Insects'' may sound like a political lecture. But given its lively cast of characters -- including Marina, an airborne future ant queen who lands on a Black Sea boardwalk in a denim skirt and red stiletto heels, and Mitya and Dima, two philosophizing moths who engage in a literally cliffhanging life-or-death battle with a bat -- it's clearly no ordinary diatribe.</p>
        <p>Set in a semiderelict seaside resort, the book paints a picture of historical and ontological limbo. The rules by which Pelevin plays are quickly established. Ants, moths, dung beetles, hemp bugs, cicadas and a very sexy fly named Natasha all indulge in swift and casual metamorphoses into human form and back again -- or, more mysteriously, from one insect form to another. Although Kafka isn't mentioned by name, the prospect of turning into a cockroach prompts ''a cold shudder'' in at least one character. Debates on ''insect rights'' are held. The menace of insecticide is addressed.</p>
        <p>A wheeling-and-dealing trio of investors -- two Russians, Arthur and Arnold, and one American, Sam -- get things going. Sam is eager to sound out the region's business possibilities. Arthur and Arnold just as eagerly push its attractions, announcing, rather oddly, that along with ''lots of fruit and grapes,'' the Crimea offers ''a bit more hemoglobin and glucose'' than Moscow. When they offer to take him on a guided tour, Sam cannily resists: ''Oh, no, no special Potemkin villages.'' He would rather just look around for himself -- and, with that, he backflips off a precipitous balcony and wings it.</p>
        <p>Sam, it turns out, is a globe-hopping mosquito. He has been to Mexico, Africa and Japan. More impressively -- to a prospective lover, anyway -- he has been to France. When asked what he was doing there, he says, ''The usual thing, sucking blood.'' It must be the capitalist in him speaking, for at this point he has taken human form. French blood is one thing; Russian blood is something else altogether (''What an emotional whirlwind! What a torrent of feeling!''), and it puts Sam constantly off balance.</p>
        <p>Beneath the novel's capricious surface is a creeping feeling of disorientation and doubt, shared by author and characters alike. Mitya the moth, pining for a light that used to be, puts it best: ''For me, it's as though there used to be something in life that was amazingly simple and more important than anything else, and then it disappeared and we've only just realized it ever existed. And it turns out that absolutely everything we ever used to want only made sense because there was this most important thing.''</p>
        <p>The insect plights of Pelevin's not-quite-insect characters have an instinctive rightness about them, whether they're wistful moths looking for a light to follow or capitalist mosquitoes seeking out another bloodsucking opportunity. One of the novel's finest passages describes a cicada's chance discovery of the modest creature comforts -- a bed, a television, a friend's company, ''a bottle or two of vodka'' -- that keep him going as he spends years digging through the ''soft Russian loam,'' awaiting the moment when he can emerge on the earth's surface to ''trill his song.'' When he does find his voice, it's not entirely surprising that he sings of ''the fact that life had passed in vain, and that it could only pass in vain, and there was no point in weeping over it.'' The human parallels are obvious: who hasn't, at moments, felt as small and as purposeless?</p>
        <p>Although there is no single plot line, the novel's chapters interlock in curious ways as characters leap from insect scale to human scale and back again. Some characters absent-mindedly rub out others; some are rescued from harm by former insects who haven't forgotten their origins. As Dima remarks, ''Life is structured very strangely.'' The same might be said in praise of this ever-inventive novel.</p>
        <p>But there are some stumbling blocks: the humor in a dope-smoking episode is redolent of a Cheech and Chong sketch. And topical references that may not mean much to an American reader pepper the text. What are we to make of the repeated mentions of Magadan, former administrative center of the Soviet political prison system, especially when they're couched in such whimsical terms? Some notes might have helped.</p>
        <p>Occasionally Andrew Bromfield's translation can feel shaky as it mixes British and American vernacular or serves up dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in a Hong Kong action movie. (''God! What a life I've been living. It's all wrong!'' ''Calm down. Us, too. But don't get hysterical about it.'') Most of the time, however, Bromfield conveys the book's sudden shifts in perspective with clarity and ease, making Pelevin's lyrical caprice come alive in the process: ''Night in the Crimea is astonishingly beautiful. As the sky darkens, it rises away from the earth and the stars are clear and bright. . . . The straight, narrow cypresses seem like columns left behind from buildings demolished long ago; the sea murmurs exactly the same way it always has; and before you rolls your sphere of dung.''</p>
        <p>Yes, well, that's the way it is when you're a dung beetle, no matter what regime you're living under. Pelevin's triumph is to make insect aspirations and anxiety feel so fragile and so soberingly universal.</p>
