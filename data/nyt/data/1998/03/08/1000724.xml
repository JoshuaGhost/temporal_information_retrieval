        <p>Sooner or later, today's windy conditions at the Doral-Ryder Open gave everyone fits. Shooting a 62, as Jim Furyk did on Friday, was out of the question. In fact, anything under par was excellent.</p>
        <p>It was a day of survival, a day to keep yourself from being blown off the leader board. And when it ended, Michael Bradley held the third-round lead, but at least a dozen players, including Tiger Woods, managed to keep themselves in the hunt.</p>
        <p>Shooting a two-under-par 70 today  and reaching nine under par for the tournament (207), Bradley held a two-stroke lead over Stewart Cink (209) heading into Sunday's final round. Woods, Billy Mayfair and Mike Brisky were tied for third place at six under par, while five more players were tied at five under, still within striking distance.</p>
        <p>Mayfair (68) and Paul Azinger (69) were the only players in the 75-man field to shoot in the 60's today as steady breezes with gusts up to 35 miles per hour turned the always-challenging Blue course at Doral Golf Resort and Spa into a test of skill and patience. Bogeys were plentiful, birdie opportunities were few, and the wind was a constant concern. Before his putt on the ninth hole, Brisky's hat blew off and had to be retrieved by his caddie. It was that kind of day, and with the Sunday forecast calling for similar conditions, the players braced themselves for more thrills.</p>
        <p>''Boy, it was a tough day,'' said Woods, who ended his round of 71 with a spectacular birdie, hitting a 7-iron out of a bunker from 148 yards to within two inches of the hole. ''Most of the holes, it's cross winds. I can't remember a shot where I had it dead downwind or dead into my face. It was always some kind of crosswind.''</p>
        <p>But Bradley, whose only victory on the PGA Tour came at the 1996 Buick Challenge, never lost his composure. Starting the day at seven under par, tied for first place with John Cook and Tim Herron, Bradley had a steady round with four birdies and two bogeys. His biggest birdie came on the 18th hole, giving him a two-shot cushion heading into Sunday. After a solid drive, Bradley hit a 7-iron to within 8 feet and made the putt.</p>
        <p>Winning would be impressive for Bradley because he is suffering from a back problem that has kept him from working on his game.</p>
        <p>''I've got a herniated disk,'' said Bradley, who has been troubled by the injury since January. ''I'm trying to strengthen it, or I'm going to have to have surgery. It gets fatigued. I haven't hit a practice ball all week. I'm going to go out and rock and roll for 18 holes Sunday, and whatever happens, happens.''</p>
        <p>While Bradley is looking for his first victory in several years, Mayfair won last week's Nissan Open, and he would love to win back-to-back championships. Mayfair's round today was another indication that his game is in a groove. And after beating Woods in a playoff last week, Mayfair's confidence has never been higher.</p>
        <p>''I went out today and did exactly what I wanted to do,'' said Mayfair, who birdied No.  16 and No. 18. ''I feel I'm putting better this week than I did last week.''</p>
        <p>Cink, who was the 1996 Nike Tour player of the year, won his first PGA Tour event last year, the Canon Greater Hartford Open. Just 24 years old, Cink believes he has the temperament to handle the final-round pressure of a prestigious tournament, something he will try to show Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to go out and play aggressive,'' said Cink, who bogeyed the 18th hole after hitting his tee shot into the water, but who also saved the bogey with a 15-foot putt to finish a round of 71. ''If I'm close at the end, I'll be drawing on those Nike Tour wins and Hartford. Knowing what I've done before helps me. I've don't see any reason why I can't do it again.''</p>
        <p>But Woods will be just as confident, with two second-place finishes and a third-place finish in four tour events this season. Woods won the  Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand in January but has not won on the PGA Tour since July. He hopes he is due for a victory.</p>
        <p>''You've got to keep giving yourself chances, and one of those times, hopefully you'll come out on top,'' Woods said. ''I've been in the hunt every week except for Pebble. I've had a chance to win. That's all you can ask for.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JOHN COOK, who started the day with a share of the lead, shot a 74 today, falling into a tie for fourth place. . . . TIM HERRON, who also started the day tied for first, shot a four-over-par 76 and fell into a tie for sixth.</p>
