      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At Sotheby's, the international auction house, annual travel and entertainment expenses during the glitzy 1980's sometimes ran to $200,000 a year -- for a single senior employee. But in these days of downsized management and Scrooge-like budgeting, purse strings everywhere are a lot tighter. Filing an expense report can call for creative gamesmanship. The dollar bill handed to a baggage handler mysteriously becomes $2. The entertainment bill for $78, split down the middle with your lunch partner, goes on the expense report as yours alone. However petty the sum, the cost of travel and entertainment, or T and E, still adds up -- to more than $156 billion annually, according to American Express Travel-Related Services, with almost half going to hotels, meals, entertainment and ''other.'' With an attitude of ''they owe it to me,'' expense-report novelists will try to cover the costs of a hairdresser, golf game, kennel and traffic ticket. The I.R.S. has raised the ceiling for undocumented expenses to $75, but as one corporate travel manager puts it, ''we're still at $25 because the minute we make it higher, we'll get taxi fares for $74.65 -- with no receipts. Even now, when we see $24.97 for a fake taxi, they must think we're really stupid.''</p>
        <p>Below are examples from two major U.S. companies of how the expense-report game goes, with comments from supervisors. It's their job to render verdicts on claims from thousands of employees -- the mundane to the out of the ordinary, the legitimate to the downright dubious.</p>
