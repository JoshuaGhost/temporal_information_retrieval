        <p>Ramon Ramos looks people in the eyes when he meets them, shakes their hands strongly and warmly, and with an engaging smile assures them that he is doing ''great'' more than eight years after a devastating car crash almost killed him. He offers a thumbs up to punctuate his comments.</p>
        <p>''Before I go to sleep every night, I thank God for my recovery,'' Ramos said. ''He made this happen.''</p>
        <p>For the longest of moments after this greeting, there is hope. Hope that Ramos will comprehend everything that is said, despite the brain damage he suffered. Hope that he will have the mental capabilities of the 30-year-old man he is. Hope that he will be the smart and vibrant person his friends knew him to be as he helped steer Seton Hall to college basketball's national championship game in 1989.</p>
        <p>But that hope fades a few minutes later when Ramos shakes hands with the same person again and repeats the same speech verbatim.</p>
        <p>After spending two months in a coma following the accident 10 days into his career with the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-8-inch Ramos has made a remarkable recovery. He learned to walk again, to talk in both Spanish and English again and even learned to drive, as long as he is accompanied by another person. Until last year, he worked in a discount store with his friend Baldin Aguayo.</p>
        <p>With each unexpected gain, there was hope for more independence.</p>
        <p>Ramos occasionally still makes progress, making 29 of 30 free throws in a rare trip to the basketball court or jogging an extra half mile along the beach, but his friends conceded that his condition has basically plateaued. He had to quit his job when Aguayo was promoted and could no longer assist him.</p>
        <p>Still, as much as his friends miss the other Ramon, it is apparent that they love this one.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was just a big nightmare when Ramon had the accident and that he'd never wake up,'' said Felix Roman, a former student manager for Seton Hall. ''Well, now, at least he's awake.''</p>
        <p>Roman uttered these words at a dinner of ham, rice and plantains that he coordinated with four other friends. Ramos came with Aguayo, who picked him up at the home he shares with his parents in Loiza. It was a draining evening, filled with moments that were equally exhilarating and depressing.</p>
        <p>Ramos rarely initiated conversation, but he seemed to follow most of the bilingual chatter. As his friends discussed the starters on the Pirates team that lost the championship game in overtime to Michigan, they remembered Ramos, John Morton, Gerald Greene and Daryll Walker, but could not remember the fifth player until Ramos interjected, ''Andrew Gaze.''</p>
        <p>P. J. Carlesimo, the coach of that Seton Hall team, believes Ramos could have been comparable to the former Knick Bill Bradley as a man who played professional basketball but whose most memorable contributions would have come off the court.</p>
        <p>Ramos was the Big East's scholar athlete in his senior year, but he had not played a minute for the Trail Blazers when his car skidded on an icy patch of interstate near Portland on Dec. 16, 1989.</p>
        <p>''His family has a much better way of looking at it than I do because I've stayed resentful,'' Carlesimo said. ''They're happy he's alive.''</p>
        <p>Carlesimo acknowledged, ''He's done much more than anyone thought he would.'' He also chastised himself for not being more diligent in keeping in touch with a player who was perhaps his favorite ever. Carlesimo said it had been ''a couple of years'' since he has seen Ramos.</p>
        <p>''I've done a really poor job of staying in touch,'' he said. ''I feel badly about it.''</p>
        <p>Roman said the backup point guard Pookey Wigington is the only member of the team who has remained close to Ramos. Wigington visited last June and said he calls Ramos about once a month.</p>
        <p>''I don't struggle with seeing Ramon at all,'' Wigington said. ''I really believe that everything happens for a reason. Who learned something from Ramon's tragic accident? Only God knows. I don't look for the old Ramon. I take Ramon for who he is today.''</p>
        <p>Before the still athletic-looking Ramos ate, Aguayo reminded him to take his medication. Ramos popped in a throat lozenge. Aguayo told him that he had to take a pill, but Ramos insisted that he had before leaving home. ''I guarantee it; I guarantee it,'' said Ramos, sounding like Muhummad Ali.</p>
        <p>When Aguayo contacted Iluminada Ramos, she confirmed that her son had taken his medication. Everyone squealed.</p>
        <p>As delighted as his friends were when Ramos recalled an incident or name, their chins sagged when he struggled. Sometimes, Ramos reached for a thought and it was not there.</p>
        <p>Asked to describe his old job with Aguayo, Ramos said: ''I help him bring in the products and carry the new products. I carry in a big box. I open up the big box, take out all the little boxes and put them on the shelf.''</p>
        <p>The description was detailed, but Aguayo later said that Ramos had not worked with him in almost a year.</p>
        <p>Ramos, who matched up against Alonzo Mourning of Georgetown and Rony Seikaly of Syracuse in college, was asked if he ever reflected on his own aborted career when he saw them playing in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to Rony Seikaly or Alonzo Mourning, it comes to my mind when Seton Hall played against Syracuse or Georgetown,'' he said. He paused for a second and then whispered, ''Ramon, it'll come to you.''</p>
        <p>It never did.</p>
        <p>''I remember when I played Syracuse, I think of Rony Seikaly and Alonzo Mourning, I think of Georgetown,'' he said again, trying to answer the question.</p>
        <p>His friends tried asking the question again in Spanish. They received the same rambling answer.</p>
        <p>''He equates everything that happened with college as being good,'' Roman said. ''Everything that happened in the N.B.A. was bad. He kept turning the question around because he doesn't want to discuss it.''</p>
        <p>While Ramos contends he reads box scores in the newspaper and watches games on television, he had no reaction when told that Latrell Sprewell had been suspended for a year for choking Carlesimo and threatening to kill him.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't heard that,'' Ramos said the second time the topic was broached and then added, ''He was a very good coach.''</p>
        <p>As the rare night out with friends ended with hugs and handshakes, Ramos thanked everyone and reminded them how special it was. He stood alone in the parking lot and soaked up the moment. Then Ramos mumbled something, took a few steps that looked like a jig and smiled as he strolled to Aguayo's car.  COLLEGE BASKETBALL</p>
