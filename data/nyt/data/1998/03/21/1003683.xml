        <p>In the wake of the New York City Board of Education's decision to require uniforms for elementary-school children, manufacturers of the signature plaid skirts and navy vests and the stores that sell them are giddily expecting a surge in business and are gearing up for the competition.</p>
        <p>''This is a milestone decision for us,'' said Michael Suttproved in a unanimous vote on Wednesday, covers 670 public elementary schools and will take effect in the fall of 1999. Currently, 229 elementary schools use uniforms voluntarily. The plan calls for each school to select the style and color of its uniform and also allows individual students and schools to opt out of wearing uniforms.</p>

        <p>In the wake of the New York City Board of Education's decision to require uniforms for elementary-school children, manufacturers of the signature plaid skirts and navy vests and the stores that sell them are giddily expecting a surge in business and are gearing up for the competition.</p>
        <p>''This is a milestone decision for us,'' said Michael Suttproved in a unanimous vote on Wednesday, covers 670 public elementary schools and will take effect in the fall of 1999. Currently, 229 elementary schools use uniforms voluntarily. The plan calls for each school to select the style and color of its uniform and also allows individual students and schools to opt out of wearing uniforms.</p>
        <p>For manufacturers and retailers, the shift in policy will mean having to make many individual sales pitches, since each school will be responsible for recommending one or more vendors to parents.</p>
        <p>Some schools that now use uniforms have a loose uniform of, say, khaki pants and a yellow shirt, giving parents leeway as to where they buy the clothes. But most seem to form a relationship with one of the dozen or so clothing stores in New York City that specialize in school uniforms, choosing one of a number of plaids or color schemes for a more traditional and specific look.</p>
        <p>Lazarus for Kids, a clothing retailer on 125th Street in Harlem, is one such business, selling uniforms to about 60 public schools in the area. A quarter of the store's business comes from uniforms. George Adams, the general manager of Lazarus, frequently visits schools with uniform samples and swatches of the 10 different plaids the store carries.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a dog-eat-dog world, with everyone going after these schools,'' he said. ''We're going to start contacting schools right away.''</p>
        <p>Although many public elementary schools in Harlem already have uniforms, Mr. Adams is anticipating an expansion of his market. That is because sometimes only a single grade in a particular school will wear them and schoolwide compliance is sporadic. Mr. Adams has started to tell manufacturers to expect an increase in orders, he said.</p>
        <p>And the uniform business may move into high gear before 1999. Craig Baker, the owner of Frank Bee School Uniforms, a manufacturer and retailer in the Bronx, said, ''We've been getting calls every day from schools that want to go over to uniforms this fall.''</p>
        <p>Another supplier of uniforms, Cookies Department Store, with outlets in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, is planning to hire three new sales representatives in its school uniform department and is gearing up for the added demand. ''I need to make sure the manufacturers I have can supply me even if it means I have to put an order in a year in advance,'' said Morris Kassab, who heads the store's school uniform program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kassab, who attended the Board of Education meeting on Wednesday, said the uniform business at Cookies had already been growing substantially in recent years, with sales climbing 30 percent annually. ''Now we'll jump 50 percent a year,'' he said. ''I'm thrilled.''</p>
        <p>In recent days, uniform suppliers from around the country have swamped the Board of Education with calls, thinking they can bid on one contract for the whole system. ''I tell them you have a free market and that it's really a local school decision,'' said Joyce S. Johnson, executive assistant to the Schools Chancellor, Dr. Rudy Crew. ''The schools have many, many choices, so make your case.''</p>
        <p>Lands' End, the mail order catalogue company in Dodgeville, Wis., is one of the national companies aiming its sights on New York. Its year-old school uniform division, which is already selling to public and private schools in 50 states, sees the policy change in New York City as a ''fantastic opportunity,'' said Mike Grasee, managing director of Lands' End's Kids Division.</p>
        <p>Although the Board of Education has not recommended specific suppliers to schools, it is advising them to be savvy shoppers. ''We try to tell the schools to ask about discounts and layaway plans -- to really shop,'' said Vicki Sheehy, deputy director of community outreach with the board's Office of Community Relations. ''We want them to ask the tough questions and get good value for their money.''</p>
        <p>Though it may be difficult for some parents to come up with the initial outlay of cash for a complete school-uniform wardrobe, school officials say uniforms cost less in the long run than regular clothes. That is one reason that the voluntary uniform program has taken hold in low-income neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''The uniforms are actually a lot cheaper than what the parents can do,'' said Dr. Askia Davis, Superintendent of District 5 in Harlem. ''These kids want Perry Ellis shirts that cost $70. But you can get two or three pairs of pants, four or five shirts, a couple of ties, a sweater and socks for $150.''</p>
