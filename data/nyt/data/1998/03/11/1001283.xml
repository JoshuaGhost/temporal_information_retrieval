        <p>As one finalist withdrew from a review for the account of the Little Caesars pizza chain, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million, another was added.</p>
        <p>The agency that withdrew, citing its present workload, was Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. Mark Goldstein, president for integrated marketing, confirmed a report of the decision in the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age.</p>
        <p>The new finalist is a team of two agencies based in Troy, Mich. One is McCann-Erickson Detroit, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, and the other is Kolon, Bittker &amp; Desmond, a onetime Little Caesars shop that specializes in retail advertising. McCann Detroit was recently named to handle advertising for Olympia Entertainment, which like Little Caesars -- a unit of Little Caesar Enterprises -- is owned by the Ilitch family.</p>
        <p>The finalist team joins two other finalists that continue in the review: Bozell Worldwide in Southfield, Mich., a unit of True North Communications, and Grey Advertising in New York. A decision is expected this month. The account was handled for more than a decade by Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners in New York, part of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi P.L.C., until the agency resigned last month.</p>
        <p>The changes in the finalist lineup came as Advertising Age and Adweek reported that Bozell had been awarded a promotional assignment for Little Caesars. ''I am satisfied that it is not a precursor and that Bozell will not necessarily get the account,'' said Gunnar Wilmot, executive vice president and managing director at McCann Detroit.</p>
