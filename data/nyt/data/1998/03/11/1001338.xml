        <p>Liz Helmrich had just taken the blood pressure of a dizzy woman who stumbled off the No. 7 train onto a crowded platform at Grand Central Station when the next call came in: a pregnant woman, also dizzy, on a Lexington Avenue train. Ms. Helmrich ran upstairs and gave the woman some water and orange juice.</p>
        <p>It was not exactly a common day for Ms. Helmrich, a practical nurse who has worked at hospitals and clinics for seven years. But as one of the biggest and most disruptive repair jobs in decades gets under way in the subway, she is part of a new experiment to help the affected lines run on time by addressing a problem that delays trains every day: ill passengers.</p>
        <p>For the next eight months, nurses will be stationed at five critical subway stops during rush hours to make sure sick passengers get off the trains quickly.</p>
        <p>''You want to keep the trains moving,'' said Ms. Helmrich, 43, ''because when one train backs up one minute, 10 trains are going to back up 30 minutes.''</p>
        <p>Every weekday, on the average, about 35 trains are delayed by passengers who fall ill with anything from heatstroke to heart attack -- the second leading cause of backups after track work, according to New York City Transit. Often, if the passenger cannot leave the train without assistance, it is held up in the station for 15 or 20 minutes until paramedics arrive.</p>
        <p>But these days, with tracks on the West Side of Manhattan partly shut down and some West Side trains running on East Side tracks, subway officials have fewer ways to reroute trains, and any delay has the potential to wreak havoc throughout the system.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, nurses can board a train immediately and get the patient onto the platform, allowing the train to go on its way, cutting delays to a few minutes at most.</p>
        <p>''We have extra road car inspectors on hand,'' Jared Lebow, a transit spokesman, said yesterday. ''We have extra mechanics. We have extra maintenance. The odd player in this equation was the sick passenger.''</p>
        <p>The nurses, hired through a temporary-employment agency, are on duty from 6:30 A.M. to 9:30 A.M. and from 4 P.M. to 7 P.M. in Manhattan at the Bowling Green, Grand Central and 125th Street stations on the Lexington Avenue line, the 96th Street-Broadway station on the Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 9 lines, and the 149th Street-Grand Concourse station on the Nos. 2, 4 and 5 lines in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The nurses started working on March 2 and will continue until the $138 million reconstruction of the Lenox Avenue tunnel, used by the Nos. 2 and 3 trains in Harlem, is completed around the end of the year. Apart from Grand Central, chosen because it is one of the busiest stations in the system, the other stations are the ones where the potential for bottlenecks during the repair job is the greatest.</p>
        <p>Despite occasional flurries of activity, the life of a subway nurse is hardly the stuff of a television series. During the first six days of the program, the nurses treated a total of 11 passengers, giving each nurse an average of one patient every 16 hours.</p>
        <p>Put another way, New York City Transit is paying the temp agency, Winston Nurse Staffing of Manhattan, about $433 per patient treated.</p>
        <p>''This is a pilot program,'' Mr. Lebow said, ''and it may not turn out to be the solution. But we'll look at the delay reports, and if we find that the nurses are keeping the railroad moving a lot faster it could prove to be worthwhile.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lebow said there was no easy way to calculate the cost to the transit system of a delay, but he said that from a health care perspective, sick-passenger delays can breed more sick-passenger delays.</p>
        <p>''It's not just a question of dollars,'' he said. ''If you have a delay in rush hour and you have 1,700 passengers on each train, and you delay a dozen trains, you're delaying over 20,000 customers and they're sitting there for 20 minutes, you create not only inconvenience but also stress.''</p>
        <p>So far, the nurses have only had to deal with one unconscious passenger; most of the cases involved simple dizziness. But Ms. Helmrich said she was ready for anything as she sat in the dispatcher's office waiting for her next call.</p>
        <p>''I think about what I'd do if somebody falls into the tracks,'' she said. ''What am I going to do? What am I legally allowed to do? Transit says I can't go down to the tracks to help that person. But if it comes to that, you do what you have to do. Am I going to get fired for saving somebody's life?''</p>
