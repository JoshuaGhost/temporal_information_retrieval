        <p>The political battles and attendant bitterness over government financing of the arts is enough to make one long for the days of enlightened private patronage.</p>
        <p>The current budget of the National Endowment for the Arts, $98 million, is the smallest in 20 years, and even that sum barely survived a divided Congress. There are private foundations, of course, but they can be as cumbersome and politically driven as government arts panels. Corporate giving usually comes with strings attached and seldom goes to cutting-edge work.</p>
        <p>So where are the moneyed, cultured patrons who think supporting an artist is as beneficial to society as building a new hospital wing?</p>
        <p>Betty Freeman of Beverly Hills, Calif., may be one of the last of them. The vivacious Ms. Freeman, 76, is a modern-day Medici. Her artistic interests are wide-ranging. She has collected American painting, befriended artists and authors and is herself a photographer.</p>
        <p>For 35 years, Ms. Freeman's special mission has been contemporary music, and her support of living composers is renowned in new-music circles. She has given money to struggling composers for living expenses, as when she rescued the self-taught eccentric Harry Partch from a vagabond life in the 1960's. And she has supported the commissioning of works for major institutions, like the 1991 ''Hyper-Viola Concerto'' by the electronic instrument whiz Tod Machover, composed for Kim Kaskashian and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group.</p>
        <p>But no panel, no demographic study group and no expert arbiter of taste influences her decisions, and that is how she likes it.</p>
        <p>''My choice of composers is purely arbitrary and based solely on my response to their music,'' Ms. Freeman said recently during a trip to New York. These included the visiting British composer Harrison Birtwistle, whose kinetic, complex works (several of which she commissioned) she considers among the towering masterpieces of our time.</p>
        <p>''My choices are also not a matter of being right,'' she added, ''because I've sometimes been disappointed in the results.'' On balance, however, she is delighted by the long list of works she has been midwife to, by composers as diverse as the American iconoclast Conlon Nancarrow and the lushly harmonic, quasi-Minimalist John Adams, who dedicated his opera ''Nixon in China'' to Ms. Freeman.</p>
        <p>''Betty is a maverick in that she makes her own decision based on personal esthetics,'' Mr. Adams said during a recent telephone conversation from his home in San Francisco. ''And with her enthusiasm and love for the artists she gets involved with, and the prestige of her giving, she can call real attention to a composer like some grand figure from a French or Russian court.''</p>
        <p>Until the 1990's, Ms. Freeman supported American composers almost exclusively. But in recent years she has been increasingly drawn to Europe, especially to the Salzburg Festival, where Gerard Mortier, the artistic director for the last six years, has been introducing bracing contemporary programming into what had been a bastion of the past, and facing considerable opposition.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freeman, a staunch financial backer of Mr. Mortier's programming efforts, has received what she calls ''hate letters'' from several composers she had previously supported, charging her with abandoning her own country. She will not name names. ''It was upsetting,'' she conceded. ''But I've gotten over it.''</p>
        <p>She also declined to put a dollar amount on her largess. ''That would make this work seem like a business rather than a creative partnership,'' she explained. Gifts can be as small as several hundred dollars. (She is financing a series of short piano works from 10 composers at $500 each.) And as large as tens of thousands of dollars. (She gave $23,000 to the Los Angeles Philharmonic to commission the composer Christopher Rouse's Cello Concerto, written for Yo-Yo Ma and first performed in 1994.) But even a conservative estimate would put the total amount in the high six figures.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freeman's involvement with contemporary music comes not from a sense of duty but from an instinctive response. ''I've always been interested in the new, and don't understand why everybody isn't,'' she said. ''I like contemporary painting, clothing, furniture, architecture. So of course I like contemporary music. Old music is fine. But I like complexity, challenge, ambiguity, abstraction.'' Her attitude distinguishes her from the typical music patron today, who is more likely to finance a new production of ''Carmen.''</p>
        <p>Nothing in Ms. Freeman's background prefigured her love of contemporary culture. She was born in Chicago and reared in Brooklyn. Her father, a chemical engineer, had his own company, the source of Ms. Freeman's wealth. Her mother was a math teacher. Neither parent had the slightest interest in the contemporary arts; nor did her two brothers, her first husband or her four children.</p>
        <p>In the Beginning Was Music</p>
        <p>Ms. Freeman, who studied piano as a child, graduated from Wellesley College in 1942 with a major in English and a minor in music, and continued studying music when she moved to Los Angeles in 1950. There she began collecting contemporary painting, and it was through the art world that her unplanned career as a music patron began.</p>
        <p>In 1961, some artist friends told her that the experimental composer La Monte Young, whose quasi-theatrical compositions (various pieces called for performers to build a fire before the audience or release a batch of butterflies) had been arrested in Connecticut for possession of marijuana. ''His friends were raising money,'' Ms. Freeman said. ''I sent $100. That was my first gift.''</p>
        <p>The next was also motivated by a composer's crisis. In 1964, she met Harry Partch, who was living in his car. Ms. Freeman brought him to the Los Angeles area, found him housing and supported his work, which included building the unconventional percussion and keyboard instruments he invented to play his pieces.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Adams her support of Partch is a good example of her prescience. ''That she could tune in on this guy who was virtually a hobo, see the value of his work and put up with his crusty, abusive behavior for 10 years until he died is amazing,'' Mr. Adams said.</p>
        <p>After that, supporting composers and commissioning works consumed her. But she got more organized,  eventually establishing the White Light Foundation. ''The tax advantages are not any greater to me when I give through my own foundation,'' she said. ''But it does help me keep track of what I'm doing.''</p>
        <p>The work with Partch also inadvertently started her career as a photographer. She was financing a documentary about Partch, but when no one from the small film crew was available to take still photographs, the cameraman thrust a camera into her hands. To her surprise, the results turned out splendidly. ''I had a knack for taking portraits,'' she said. ''I later attended some workshops given by Ansel Adams and Cole Weston, but essentially I learned by doing. A camera is like a golf club: this inert thing until you use it.''</p>
        <p>Her work has been exhibited in Europe, Japan and extensively on both coasts of the United States, including a show last season in the lobby of the New York State Theater. Her subjects, almost without exception, have been composers.</p>
        <p>Adding to Ms. Freeman's mystique as a Medici was the series of musicales she sponsored at her elegant Beverly Hills home over 10 years. They began in 1981, when the Los Angeles-based music critic Alan Rich suggested that she invite composers to discuss and play tapes of their works in an informal setting with a variety of guests. Ms. Freeman's commodious, sunny salon was the ideal space: the walls are lined with paintings by, among others, Rothko, Lichtenstein, Stella and her friend David Hockney.</p>
        <p>The Freeman musicales were fabled. Pierre Boulez, Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt, Luciano Berio, Joan La Barbara and dozens of others came to discuss their work. Once in a while, a nonmusician would be presented, as when Mr. Hockney talked about his scenic designs for opera or when the poet Jack Larson discussed his collaboration with Virgil Thomson on the opera ''Lord Byron,'' a complete recording of which Ms. Freeman financed.</p>
        <p>Usually, 100 guests would attend and important networking occurred, like the time the composer Lou Harrison, who wanted to present a gamelan concert at the Getty Museum, met Thomas Reese, the museum's deputy director. That was all it took.</p>
        <p>The musicales, however, were bound up closely with Ms. Freeman's second husband, the painter Franco Assetto, who died in 1991. A hardy, shaven-headed Italian, Assetto could ''not stand modern music,'' Ms. Freeman said. But he loved to cook, so he stayed happily in the kitchen during the programs, slicing fruits and cheeses, baking Italian breads and preparing enormous bowls of pasta. With his death, the ambiance of the musicales changed, and Ms. Freeman ended them.</p>
        <p>Now her attention is focused on Mr. Mortier and Salzburg. She has been the sole supporter of a contemporary music series at the festival called ''Next Generation,'' which presents composers under 40 like the German Matthias Pintscher. She is also financing a series of three operas over the next three seasons by Mr. Pintscher, the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho and the British composer George Benjamin.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freeman calls Mr. Mortier ''the smartest man I ever met.'' The American composers who are dismayed by Ms. Freeman's loss of interest in American music (including two who admitted to writing private letters of protest but would not talk on the record) portray him as a Svengali who has stolen her away.</p>
        <p>''That's ridiculous,'' Mr. Mortier said recently in New York. ''Betty was always open to new things, especially people she has not known about before.'' And Mr. Mortier defends his festival as an international gathering. ''We have presented American composers as different as John Adams and Elliott Carter,'' he said. ''We just signed up Philip Glass for a great choral symphony.''</p>
        <p>What has distinguished Ms. Freeman's patronage, and kept it clear of politics and polemics, is its personal orientation: she supports what she likes. Her likes have now shifted.</p>
        <p>''I've done a lot for American composers,'' Ms. Freeman said. None of her new detractors can dispute that. Besides, they can always try to change her mind, which may be easier than petitioning a government arts panel or foundation. And once Betty Freeman and her kind are gone, panels and foundations are likely to be all there is.</p>
