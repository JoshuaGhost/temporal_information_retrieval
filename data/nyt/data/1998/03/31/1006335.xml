        <p>Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, was on his way to a news conference to criticize his party for blocking what he saw as true change in campaign finance rules.</p>
        <p>But only 10 minutes before he was to meet with reporters, standing alongside Democratic allies and spokesmen for various liberal interest groups, an aide brought Mr. Shays word that his party's leaders had put him in yet another bind: The main Republican bill had, at the last minute, been sweetened in a way that could force him back into the fold.</p>
        <p>His press secretary, Seth L. Amgott, proclaimed himself ''terrified.'' Mr. Shays was still not sure how he would vote, but he had promised House leaders that he would support the bill if it effectively banned soft money in Federal elections. But if he did vote for the bill, would the same editorial writers who had just proclaimed him a hero now cast him as a sellout?</p>
        <p>When the cameras rolled, Mr. Shays spoke out as planned against the process that his party's House leaders had used to limit the debate on campaign finance rules. They had kept the bipartisan bill he had sponsored with Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, from coming to a vote. And they had used fancy parliamentary moves to bring only Republican bills -- four of them -- to the floor in a way that his allies insisted would yield no real change even if they passed.</p>
        <p>In his shirt sleeves on an unusually warm spring day, Mr. Shays told reporters, ''I'm involved in a process where I don't know if I'm up at bat or on the field. But whoever wins or loses, it won't be the American people.''</p>
        <p>When asked whether he would support the comprehensive Republican bill, he said he had not seen it and so could not say. But, he said, he would not vote against a good bill just to make a point.</p>
        <p>A soft-spoken moderate who nonetheless says he has been one of Speaker Newt Gingrich's ''biggest fans,'' Mr. Shays seemed genuinely sad to speak out against his party's leaders. And he was still defending Mr. Gingrich to an extent, saying the Speaker was only doing what the Republican conference wanted.</p>
        <p>Walking away from the news conference, he said he would probably end up voting for all four Republican bills. But, almost to himself, he added, ''When the Republicans took over, we said things were going to be different, but I have not seen that to be the case.''</p>
        <p>Back in his office, a dozen staff members were waiting to talk through the issue. Mr. Amgott told Mr. Shays that he was scheduled to be on the evening's ''News Hour'' with Jim Lehrer in a long debate with Representative Bill Thomas of California, the sponsor of the Republican bill. Mr. Shays immediately asked his staff to schedule two hours of prep time.</p>
        <p>But after a few minutes, Mr. Amgott was back with a ''News Hour'' update: ''They don't know if they want you on as a great reformer if you're voting for'' the Republican bills.</p>
        <p>''But I'm going to be very critical of the process,'' Mr. Shays complained. Still, he was out.</p>
        <p>He also learned he would now have trouble getting time to speak on the House floor in the debate before the votes. His party did not want to give him time to oppose the leadership, and Democrats were suddenly hesitant to yield their time.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans had said you could have as much time as you wanted but that's changed,'' said an aide, Allison Clinton Rak. ''You can have one minute. The time is in high demand.''</p>
        <p>Mr Shays said: ''I don't want one minute. One minute is a joke. But the question is, Do I call Thomas'' to beg for time.</p>
        <p>About then, a representative of Common Cause dropped by with the latest on the bill, which Mr. Shays had still not seen. It would not, after all, ban all soft money for Federal elections, she told him, because it would not address the use of soft money for ''issues ads,'' which are one way parties have skirted limits on spending.</p>
        <p>With his feet propped up on the coffee table, Mr. Shays sighed and said, ''I'm keeping my options open, and this is why.''</p>
        <p>At 6 P.M., just as debate on the bills was to begin, Mr. Shays decided to grab what he called a late lunch in the member's dining room. There, he took a call from a Republican member still lobbying for his vote -- and received congratulations from a Democrat, Representative Barney Frank, who crossed the room to thank him for his efforts.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, he said, he could not be too annoyed with his party because he believed that its machinations would ultimately mobilize public support for an overhaul of campaign finance rules.</p>
        <p>''I'm not enraged'' at their tactics, he said of Republican leaders, smiling. ''I just think it's dumb.''</p>
        <p>Not long before the late-night vote, Mr. Shays finally made his decision: He was not comfortable that the main Republican bill would truly ban soft money. And he would oppose it after all.</p>
