        <p>World Wide Web has many sites for college basketball fans who cannot attend NCAA tournaments' semifinal and championship rounds (M)</p>

        <p>It is normally considered bad form for people to strip to the waist, paint their bodies in bright colors, wag their index fingers and scream ''We're No. 1'' in triple-digit decibels.</p>
        <p>And then there are the three weeks in March when such behavior is not only tolerated but often encouraged, especially in arenas where college basketball players put orange balls through metal hoops in search of a national championship. Those three weeks officially began last night, when 64 men's and 64 women's teams were given the maps they must follow to reach the Final Four -- in San Antonio for the men and in Kansas City, Mo., for the women.</p>

        <p>It is normally considered bad form for people to strip to the waist, paint their bodies in bright colors, wag their index fingers and scream ''We're No. 1'' in triple-digit decibels.</p>
        <p>And then there are the three weeks in March when such behavior is not only tolerated but often encouraged, especially in arenas where college basketball players put orange balls through metal hoops in search of a national championship. Those three weeks officially began last night, when 64 men's and 64 women's teams were given the maps they must follow to reach the Final Four -- in San Antonio for the men and in Kansas City, Mo., for the women.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, not every fan can pack the body paint and make the trip. For those left behind, whose appetites for three-point jump shots and backdoor layups aren't satisfied by television, radio and newspapers, there is always the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>While the real road to the Final Four begins this week in several cities, the Internet route might as well begin in Illinois, where March Madness got its start, according to the Illinois High School Association. The association says it coined the term as early as 1939 -- decades before it became synonymous with the National Collegiate Athletic Association's basketball tournament -- and received trademark status for the phrase in 1989. The high school association has a Web page devoted to the history to make its case.</p>
        <p>The N.C.A.A., of course, is not worrying about a cease-and-desist order. According to Angie Lovett, its director of licensing, the association has the rights to use March Madness in connection with college basketball, while the Illinois association has the rights for high school ball.</p>
        <p>The N.C.A.A. also has the rights to ''Final Four'' and ''Big Dance'' and shares ''Sweet Sixteen'' with the Kentucky High School Athletic Association, Ms. Lovett said.</p>
        <p>Whatever search term one uses, it is still basketball, and fans need action and statistics. The official N.C.A.A. page promises them in abundance, offering ''cybercasts'' of the men's and women's tournaments with play-by-play coverage accompanied by photos and audio. These, in real time, could prove vital to fans whose teams were shipped across the country to a hostile regional site by an unforgiving selection committee. In addition, the site carries all the basic information on brackets, venues and schedules, and includes Final Four records.</p>
        <p>Need more stops on the way to the big game? Try the Big Three of the on-line sports services: CBS Sportsline, CNN/SI and ESPN Sportszone. CBS will broadcast the men's games on television, and ESPN and ESPN2 will broadcast the later rounds of the women's tournament. The three services offer scores and news and statistics aplenty, and the CBS site, dubbed March Mayhem, offers a good history of the tournament. All three sites have forums for basketball fans. Users must first register or download software, but it is free.</p>
        <p>For fans who want to concentrate on X's and O's, the Coach's Edge site takes them inside the locker room and diagrams favorite plays.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it takes a basketball fan to know what others want. Ted Heffernan, a graduate student at the University of Cincinnati, created Web sites for the 1996 and 1997 tournaments and is back this year. His '98 site offers excellent links to other tournament-related sites and also has a tournament simulator program. Especially useful are links to the participating teams' home pages.</p>
        <p>Eventually, basketball vagabonds will end up in San Antonio or Kansas City. The San Antonio Express-News has set up a site that not only includes tournament news but also has information for the fans who make it to the games on March 28 and 30, like a seating chart for the Alamodome and lists of restaurants and attractions.</p>
        <p>Followers of the women's tournament can check out two sites from Kansas City, where games will be played on March 27 and 29. One contains a guide to the city and information on the tournament. The other, maintained by The Kansas City Star, will keep track of the action and has an interesting time line on the evolution of the women's game. It also has a clock that mirrors the anticipation of the true fan, counting down to the games -- by the second.</p>
