        <p>The lawyer for a man accused in the near-fatal beating of a man outside a Westhampton Beach nightclub two years ago called as the first defense witnesses yesterday two brothers who told the police that the attacker was a tall man with spiked blond hair.</p>
        <p>The man charged with attempted murder in the beating, Austin Offen, a 27-year-old landscaper from Floral Park, Queens, has black hair.</p>
        <p>The brothers, Tyrone and Timothy Booker, both friends of the victim, Shane Daniels, 23, were asked by Mr. Offen's lawyer to recall what they remembered about the attacker.</p>
        <p>They both testified that it was difficult to recall what they saw two years ago. The lawyer, Bruce A. Barket, then produced statements the two brothers gave to the police in which they both described the attacker as having spiked blond hair.</p>
        <p>In statements given to investigators after the brawl, three witnesses who have been called by the prosecution described the attacker as having light brown or blond hair.</p>
        <p>A co-defendant, Constantine Chronis, 36, who was a New York City narcotics detective at the time of the incident, is to be tried separately on charges of assault and official misconduct.</p>
