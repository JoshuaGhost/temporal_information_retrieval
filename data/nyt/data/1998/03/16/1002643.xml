        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview with Kathleen E. Willey by Ed Bradley on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes,'' which was broadcast last night. After Ms. Willey repeated her account of an encounter with President Clinton at the White House in 1993, in which she says that Mr. Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance, she went on to talk about her state of mind and about what has happened to her subsequently. A transcript of the interview was provided by CBS News.</p>
        <p>MR. BRADLEY: What were you thinking?</p>
        <p>MS. WILLEY:  Well, there were all kinds of things going through my mind. When I think back on it, it was kind of like I was watching it in slow motion and thinking surely this is not happening. And at the same time, I thought, ''Well, maybe I ought to just give him a good slap across the face.'' And then I thought, ''Well, I don't think you can slap the President of the United States like that.'' And I just decided it was just time to get out of there.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you say anything to him, or was there anything about your behavior that invited an advance?</p>
        <p>A. I have gone over this so many times, so very many times, because I think that your natural instinct is to wonder, ''Did I bring this on? Did I send the wrong signal?'' The only signals that I was sending that day were that I was very upset, very distraught, and I needed to help my husband.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you feel intimidated?</p>
        <p>A. I didn't feel intimidated. I just felt over-powered.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you ever say: ''Stop. No. Get away from me?''</p>
        <p>A. I just pushed him away. I pushed him away and I said, ''I think I'd better go.''</p>
        <p>Q. And what did he say?</p>
        <p>A. He kept looking at his watch, because he told me that he had a meeting and he said they could wait. And I said, ''Well.'' I said, ''Well, I'm leaving.''</p>
        <p>Q. When you walked out of there,  what were you thinking?</p>
        <p>A. I just could not believe that that had happened in that office. I just could not believe the recklessness of this act.</p>
        <p>Q. Recklessness? What do you mean, recklessness?</p>
        <p>A. Of his doing that in the, right outside the Oval Office. I mean, there are Secret Service people around, there are stewards around. There, his staff is around. I just thought it was extremely reckless. Later on, I think I was feeling angry. I was feeling that I had been taken advantage of. My circumstances had been taken advantage of.</p>
        <p>Q. You think he betrayed your friendship?</p>
        <p>A. Absolutely. Especially since he knew my husband also. I mean, he was my husband and he was in trouble. And I was there, asking a friend, who also happened to be the President of the United States, for help. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. Have you ever been pressured?</p>
        <p>A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. How? Tell me about it.</p>
        <p>A. I felt pressured by Mr. Bennett.</p>
        <p>Q. The President's attorney?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. We were together at some point before our court hearing, and he mentioned that he had just left, he had just been at the White House, and the President asked for me and told him that he just thought the world of me. And he said, ''Now this was not a sexual harassment was it?'' And I didn't answer him. And he said, ''Well it wasn't unwelcome, was it?'' And I said to him, ''It was unwelcome and unexpected.''</p>
        <p>Q. Did you feel intimidated by Mr. Bennett?</p>
        <p>A. I felt pressured. Especially when he threw in the business about ''Well, the President thinks the world of you,'' and I found that a little laughable.</p>
        <p>Q. Why?</p>
        <p>A. Well, because if the President thought the world of me, why did he do what he did? . . .</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley recounts that Ms. Willey said that Mr. Bennett had suggested she find herself a criminal lawyer.</p>
        <p>MS. WILLEY: The insinuation to me was that Mr. Bennett was implying that I was going to face some kind of a criminal charge for perjury or something else, and that I would need an inside Washington criminal lawyer and and I don't. . . .</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley mentions President Clinton's testimony about the encounter in his deposition in the Paula Jones case that the encounter with Ms. Willey was not a sexual advance.</p>
        <p>Q. If the President is saying that under oath, is he lying?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. . . .</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley describes a previous encounter between Ms. Willey and Mr. Clinton in 1992, when Mr. Clinton, who was running for President, made a campaign stop in Richmond.</p>
        <p>MS. WILLEY: I had seen him before at previous fund-raisers and he sent someone over to get my telephone number.</p>
        <p>MR. BRADLEY: Did he ever use it?</p>
        <p>A. He called me when he got to Williamsburg and when I got home he called me and asked me if I could -- he had lost his voice and he was worried about the debate the next evening. And he asked me how far I was from Williamsburg and I told him. And I kiddingly told him -- I just jokingly said, ''It sounds like you need some chicken soup.'' And, he said, ''Well, would you bring me some?'' . . .</p>
        <p>Q. You declined to go because----</p>
        <p>A. Because my instincts told me he wasn't interested in chicken soup. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. You were a reluctant witness. You didn't want your story to go public?</p>
        <p>A. No.</p>
        <p>Q. Why not?</p>
        <p>A. It was just a bad story. It was just horrible behavior on the part of the President. And I did not think it was my place to make it public knowledge.</p>
        <p>Q. You didn't walk away. You didn't lodge a complaint anywhere.</p>
        <p>A. No. That's right. That was the choice I made.</p>
        <p>Q. Because?</p>
        <p>A. That was the choice that I thought was the best one. I was embarrassed for the President's behavior. And I saw no benefit whatsoever, in filing a complaint. . . .</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley asks why she decided to go public.</p>
        <p>A. I just think that it's time to tell this story. I think that too many lies are being told. Too many lives are being ruined. And I think it's time for the truth to come out.</p>
