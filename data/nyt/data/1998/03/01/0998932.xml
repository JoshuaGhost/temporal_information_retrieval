        <p>AT one time, plastics were considered to be cheap substitutes for quality materials like wood or metal. Now, however, many craftsmen recognize that plastics can be an attractive and durable material to work with.</p>
        <p>Plastics can be divided into two broad categories: thermosetting plastics and thermoplastics. Thermosetting plastics can be molded only once, during the initial setting process. At that time, a chemical hardener is added that causes them to solidify. After that, they cannot be remolded or reshaped (except by mechanical means like sawing or grinding). Thermosetting plastics include epoxy cements and plastic laminates (used for countertops).</p>

        <p>AT one time, plastics were considered to be cheap substitutes for quality materials like wood or metal. Now, however, many craftsmen recognize that plastics can be an attractive and durable material to work with.</p>
        <p>Plastics can be divided into two broad categories: thermosetting plastics and thermoplastics. Thermosetting plastics can be molded only once, during the initial setting process. At that time, a chemical hardener is added that causes them to solidify. After that, they cannot be remolded or reshaped (except by mechanical means like sawing or grinding). Thermosetting plastics include epoxy cements and plastic laminates (used for countertops).</p>
        <p>In contrast to thermosetting plastics, thermoplastics can be reheated and remolded. Thermosetting plastics include acrylics and polycarbonates, vinyls and polystyrene.</p>
        <p>Thermosetting plastic laminates can be used for facing table and countertops. Epoxy cements are good for making repairs, and also for casting small parts. Thermoplastics can be used much like wood or metal for constructing boxes, shelves or even simple furniture. In tubular form, thermoplastics can be used in plumbing installations.</p>
        <p>The same safety rules for wood and metal working also apply to plastic working. Power tools should be properly grounded and in good working order. Don safety goggles and a good quality dust mask when cutting or drilling plastic, and secure all work pieces in a vise or with clamps. Some plastics, like resins, hardeners, sealants and adhesives, can irritate the skin and emit toxic fumes. Protect yourself by wearing a respirator with a charcoal filter. Also wear long sleeves, rubber gloves and a shop apron.</p>
        <p>Before drilling or cutting any plastic stock, it's necessary to mark the cutting lines and center points. This is easy enough if the stock is covered with a protective masking paper. If there is no masking paper you can improvise by gluing (use water soluble glue) a sheet of paper to the work. Draw your lines directly on the paper and cut or drill through it and the plastic. Another way to make cutting lines is by scratching them on the plastic with a metal scriber.</p>
        <p>Generally, the skills and tools used for woodworking or metal working are adequate for cutting and shaping thermoplastics, although in some cases they may have to be modified. High-speed twist drills, for example, can be used to drill holes in acrylic, but the tip of drill bit may chip the surface of the material. This can be avoided by rounding the sharp point at the tip and by blunting the cutting lip of the bit with a file.</p>
        <p>When boring into plastic, particularly hard acrylics, use a slow speed (500 to 1,000 revolutions per minute) and a moderate feed. Ease up on the pressure just before the drill breaks through the material. Whenever possible use a piece of scrap wood as a backing block behind the work piece.</p>
        <p>The friction between the drill bit and the material can generate enough heat to melt the plastic, so back the drill out of the hole periodically and allow it to cool.</p>
        <p>You can use ordinary hand or power saws to cut plastic, but it is important to use a saw with fine teeth, otherwise it will chip the material. A carpenter's crosscut saw (it should have 10 to 12 teeth per inch) is adequate for cutting sheet or tube stock, but hacksaw or a keyhole saw with a fine tooth blade will give a smoother cut.</p>
        <p>Ideally the best tool to cut plastics is a band saw fitted with a metal cutting blade. It has table and a fence to guide the work so you can make accurate cuts quickly. However, it is an expensive tool to buy and not the worth the investment if you only have a few simple projects in the works. An acceptable substitute is the sabre saw fitted with a fine-tooth, metal-cutting blade. For long straight cuts, you can improvise a rip fence by clamping (place small blocks of wood under the clamps to keep from marring the work piece) a straight board to the work.</p>
        <p>Any saw blade, no matter how fine, will leave a coarse edge on the work. For a professional appearance this edge should be filed, first with a double-cut then a single-cut file. If you intend to bond this edge to another piece, then it is unnecessary to smooth it further, but an exposed edge should be smoothed with sandpaper. Start with a medium grit paper (220) and progress to a super fine (600) grit. Finally, polish the edge with a cloth buffing wheel charged with white polishing rouge.</p>
