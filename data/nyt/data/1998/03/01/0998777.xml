        <p>In july 1945, a group of scientists huddled in the new Mexico dawn to witness the first nuclear explosion. They had created a terrible power, but one that nations have successfully controlled for more than 50 years. Now we have unleashed a very different but similarly awesome force, one capable of overthrowing governments and their policies almost overnight. And there are no systems in place for controlling it.</p>
        <p>This force is the global financial marketplace. Strengthening for years, the markets have emerged as the ruling international authority, more potent than any military or political power. When arrayed against any nation, including the United States, they can impose previously unthinkable changes.</p>
        <p>Such changes can sometimes be for the good. Indeed, the global markets have recently propelled many nations toward democracy. But there is a new and frightening downside, which we glimpsed in October but still haven't fully seen or understood. That is the risk of a chain reaction, a global market meltdown that could shatter confidence and plunge the world into recession or worse.</p>
        <p>Imagine, for example, that Brazil's currency collapsed, losing more than half its value in a week. The country's banking system would totter while its stock and bond markets plummeted. Big international investors would race for the door, but not before sustaining heavy losses. Fearing that the Brazilian crisis would quickly spread to other Latin American markets, they would bail out of those too, causing them to plunge. The International Monetary Fund could not react quickly enough.</p>
        <p>Now incurring wider losses, these same investors would try to protect themselves by pre-emptively selling in other foreign markets. This would trigger a stock market free fall in Asia and Europe, and then on Wall Street. Within a week, worldwide markets might lose an unprecedented quarter or more of their value. Stunned consumers and businesses would cut back their spending plans, fearing that the good times were over. This would be the financial shock that Alan Greenspan obliquely described as the one risk to the American economy today.</p>
        <p>This risk of a global meltdown reflects the law of unintended consequences. The worldwide elimination of barriers to trade and capital, and the rise of communications technology, have created the global financial marketplace, which informed observers hailed for bringing private capital to the developing world, encouraging economic growth and democracy.</p>
        <p>But in the past five years, as seamless 24-hour markets clicked in, the risks inherent in the new system became apparent. No one had envisioned such growth and the expansion of power that accompanied it. Average daily worldwide trading in financial instruments now may exceed</p>
        <p>$1 trillion. Yes, each day. This is largely carried out by huge financial institutions with short investment horizons.</p>
        <p>The result is like an extraterrestrial force: gigantic flows of money, directed electronically, which dominate world finance and can change direction in an hour. They are beyond the control of any government or regulator. And there is no method of directly communicating with them.</p>
        <p>Nations depend on stable currencies for facilitating imports and exports, for financing trade and budget deficits and for attracting investment capital. But their currencies are traded minute by minute around the world. As long as the markets look favorably on a nation's financial performance, there can be economic stability.</p>
        <p>But if they render a negative verdict, the results can be disastrous. This is what happened to Mexico in late 1994, when it effectively went bankrupt. The markets suddenly judged Mexico's Government to be borrowing too much foreign capital on a short-term basis. Foreign investors fled, the peso plunged and the country couldn't pay off its debts. Over subsequent months, its economy contracted and bitter times set in. Only a controversial $20 billion in emergency financing organized by the United States kept Mexico from complete collapse.</p>
        <p>Then last June, the global markets delivered a similarly harsh blow to Southeast Asia. It came out of the blue, and it followed years and years of celebrating the ''miracle'' economic rise of these ''Asian tigers.'' Like the Titanic, they had acquired an aura of invincibility.</p>
        <p>But that was shattered like a bullet exploding a glass. The markets judged that first Thailand, then Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea were presiding over rickety banking systems loaded with bad loans. One by one their currencies were battered, some losing up to 70 percent of their value. The national treasuries all ran out of money trying to stop the plunge, and weakened economies followed. This time it was the International Monetary Fund that organized nearly $120 billion of emergency loans for these four countries to keep them breathing and prevent a domino effect elsewhere.</p>
        <p>For the first time we saw what a worldwide collapse might look like. As the Asian financial crisis widened last October, the Hong Kong stock market, the region's biggest, began to fall. Then it plunged, down more than 10 percent in one day. This instantly triggered huge, same-day market declines across Europe and a shocking 554-point drop on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The next day, the world financial community held its breath, unsure whether the chain reaction would accelerate or abate. We were on the precipice. Luckily, markets stabilized, but those events may have been the tremor before the earthquake, and that was only four months ago.</p>
        <p>High anxiety among the world's central bankers and finance ministers over the Asian crisis continues. Yes, they want to avoid calamitous impacts on South Korea and Indonesia, both strategically important countries. But their real fear is that the Asian market collapse will suddenly go global. Privately they consider that a real possibility.</p>
        <p>What can be done to limit this risk of worldwide financial infection? There is only one bulwark, and it is the I.M.F., the world's emergency lender to nations in distress. But we need a vastly stronger and more alert I.M.F. to successfully contain those regional crises. Even now, global financial markets are unsure if the emergency I.M.F. financing for Indonesia is enough, or whether that nation will still default.</p>
        <p>The huge Asian financing package has depleted the I.M.F.'s resources to an alarming degree. It needs a capital infusion from its shareholders, with the U.S. share even bigger than the $18 billion President Clinton has requested. The congressional outlook is uncertain. But a rejection of increased U.S. commitments could, by itself, destabilize world markets.</p>
        <p>The managerial capabilities of the I.M.F. also require upgrading. Despite misgivings among finance ministers -- who fear self-fulfilling prophecies -- the fund must serve as an early-warning system for deteriorating national finances. Here at home, the major credit-rating agencies issue an alert if a corporation is faltering or if a city's debt load is getting too onerous. The I.M.F. should do the same.</p>
        <p>Today, the I.M.F. expresses its concerns privately to governments with shaky finances. But these warnings are usually ignored by national political leaders, who have no interest in administering tough medicine.</p>
        <p>Yet if the I.M.F. remained studiously apolitical, it could issue such warnings publicly, and financial markets would then apply the pressure for change. Yes, such admonitions could themselves trigger crises. But if the I.M.F. sounded the alarm early enough, it would more often move governments toward sounder finances and pull them back from the brink.</p>
        <p>World leaders have discussed this warning capability for some time, but it was hard to take such an important step to ward off a danger that seemed, in previous years, to be hypothetical. We no longer have that excuse.</p>
        <p>Anyone who thinks that the United States is immunized against all these risks is wrong. We may be in favor with these markets now, but that can change quickly. Indeed, the dollar set an all-time low against the yen only three years ago, causing much nervousness around the world. Should the markets move more strongly against our currency, even America's resources could not sustain its value. Like a long list of nations before us, we could be forced to raise interest rates drastically, which would probably throw the economy into a recession.</p>
        <p>We saw some of this in 1978, when the dollar came under pressure. President Carter, trying to placate the markets, promised to adopt a tighter budget. The markets judged his promise weak and smashed the dollar down. One week later, the President had no choice but to announce yet a smaller deficit, even though it upset his political priorities.</p>
        <p>We have entered an age of unprecedented financial power and risk. The strength of worldwide markets, already immeasurable, will only grow. Markets will be the dominant, worldwide force of the early 21st century, dwarfing that of the United States or any consortium of nations. And as with nuclear weapons, we are now permanently in their shadow.  Roger C. Altman, an investment banker, served in the United States Treasury Department under Presidents Carter and Clinton.</p>
