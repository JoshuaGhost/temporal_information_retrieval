        <p>Only one favorite fell as the Big East women's basketball tournament opened at Rutgers today with five first-round games. In the evening session, sixth-seeded Syracuse lost for the second time in a week to Georgetown, which had dropped seven of its last eight games.</p>
        <p>Fourth-seeded Villanova struggled, and fifth-seeded Notre Dame coasted in winning afternoon games at the Louis Brown Athletic Center,  while eighth-seeded West Virginia narrowly avoided an upset. In the other evening game, seventh-seeded Boston College defeated Providence.</p>
        <p>The three top-seeded teams -- No. 1 Connecticut (28-2), No. 2 Rutgers (18-8) and No. 3 Miami (18-8) -- were rewarded with first-round byes.</p>
        <p>The quarterfinals Sunday will start with Notre Dame against Villanova at noon and Connecticut against West Virginia at 2 P.M. Rutgers will play Boston College at 6 P.M., and Miami will meet Georgetown at 8 P.M.</p>
        <p>VILLANOVA 56, PITTSBURGH 51 At halftime, Pitt (6-21) led by 30-21, and had held Villanova (19-8) to zero offensive rebounds. But in the second half, Villanova kept moving the ball, forcing Pitt to become more aggressive on defense, and that allowed 5-foot-9-inch Jenn Beisel of Villanova to spin by Pitt's big post players for layups.</p>
        <p>''We have trouble getting good shots unless we move,'' Villanova Coach Harry Perretta said, ''and we finally started to move.'' Beisel finished with a game-high 19 points.</p>
        <p>NOTRE DAME 94, ST. JOHN'S 57 Notre Dame (19-8) ran off to a 14-0 lead and countered the zone defense of St. John's (6-21) with 3-point shots. Sheila McMillen's 8-of-12 shooting from 3-point range and her team's 13-of-20 shooting broke tournament records.</p>
        <p>The Irish, a Final Four team last year, led by 77-29 midway through the second half. St. John's made only 23.7 percent of its shots (14 of 59), but its coach, Charlene Thomas-Swinson, was positive. ''This game gave a young team like ours a chance to see what it needs in a tournament like this,'' she said.</p>
        <p>WEST VIRGINIA 67, SETON HALL 65 With little more than three minutes left, Seton Hall (8-19) led by 9 points, but West Virginia (12-15) started a man-to-man press and got turnovers. The Mountaineers won at the end when Rebecca Burbridge gunned a pass to Adrienne Beard under the basket, and Beard sank the game-deciding shot.</p>
        <p>As Phyllis Mangina, the Seton Hall coach, described it, ''We stopped their three, the ball was loose on the floor, they picked it up and fired it in, and that's our season.''</p>
        <p>GEORGETOWN 68, SYRACUSE 59 Kim Gallon and Sylita Thomas scored 20 points apiece to lead the 11th-seeded Hoyas (9-18). Georgetown, which had lost seven of its last eight games, beat sixth-seeded Syracuse for the second time in a week. Teakyta Barnes had 19 points and Paula Moore added 16 points and 10 rebounds for Syracuse (12-15).</p>
        <p>BOSTON COLLEGE 87, PROVIDENCE 77 Alissa Murphy and Allison Booth came off the bench and scored 19 points apiece to lead Boston College (17-10). The 19-point performances were a season high for Booth, a junior center, and a career high for Murphy, a sophomore guard. Dana Trippany came off the bench to lead Providence (10-17) with 17 points.</p>
