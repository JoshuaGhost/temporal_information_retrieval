        <p>Turnabout is fair play, the saying goes, so IVANA TRUMP organized a birthday party for the man who organized one for her last month, COUNT ROFFREDO GAETANI D'ARAGONA. They celebrated his turning 43 at Sofia Fabulous Pizza, a restaurant on Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, and later danced in the lounge at Moomba, on Seventh Avenue South. Seen in the crowd were GIUSEPPI CIPRIANI, who runs the SoHo restaurant Downtown, and Mrs. Trump's teen-age daughter, IVANKA. Not seen was DONALD J. TRUMP, who attended Mrs. Trump's party last month. . . . JAMES CAAN, the hotheaded Sonny Corleone in ''The Godfather,'' walked into at Tapika, on Eighth Avenue at 56th Street, at 3:30 P.M. ''I'm hungry,'' he said. Told that the restaurant would not begin serving dinner until 5, he left, without giving an incendiary performance. . . . While filming a scene for the HBO series ''Sex and the City,'' the crew blocked the sidewalk on Fifth Avenue between 80th and 81st Streets. Cameras focused on SARAH JESSICA PARKER, who strolled down the avenue in a tan coat. Some pedestrians focused on getting where they had to go. ''I'm a doctor,'' a woman said as she barged past. ''I have patients waiting.''</p>
