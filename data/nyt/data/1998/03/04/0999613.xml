        <p>As Germany's political titans squared off for national elections later this year, Wilfried Klumski and about 130,000 other municipal workers gave them a hint today of what the winner's prize -- or burden -- will be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klumski, 45, is a bus driver in Bonn with 20 years' experience. Today at 4 A.M., he and his colleagues went on strike for five hours to reinforce union demands in wage talks under way in Stuttgart, as did tens of thousands of German public service workers elsewhere.</p>
        <p>All told, Mr. Klumski said, 160 buses and 80 streetcars stayed in his depot in the Friesdorf district. In Berlin, union officials like Mr. Klumski reckoned, a million commuters got snarled in traffic. Elsewhere, streetcars stopped, clerks refused to type, schools did not open and flights were canceled or delayed.</p>
        <p>The timing of the strikes -- which started on Monday, the day Germany's opposition Social Democrats nominated Gerhard Schroder to run against Chancellor Helmut Kohl in September -- was a coincidence.</p>
        <p>But the question, however unintentional, was equally clear for both contenders. Both Mr. Kohl and Mr. Schroder talk of reform of the economic system that provides people like Mr. Klumski with benefits that are the envy of many in Europe. And so, as Germany faces pressure to cut back on its welfare state, how much pain will workers accept?</p>
        <p>''We know that things can't be like in the past, what with globalization and the pressure from Europe,'' Mr. Klumski said. ''But we don't want things to go too far.''</p>
        <p>Sensing growing pressure on his union, which represents public service and city transit workers, Mr. Klumski saw a broader point, too.  ''We saw what happened in Britain under Margaret Thatcher when the unions were smashed, he said. ''Now they want to achieve that here.''</p>
        <p>Indeed there is a broader point. Germany, Europe's ponderous economic powerhouse, is facing the rigors of global competition just as pressure increases to cut public spending in the name of the planned single currency in Europe.</p>
        <p>Employers and others maintain that unless the high cost of hiring people is cut, Germany will not be flexible enough to meet those challenges and still reduce its record unemployment level of 12 percent of the workforce, or 4.8 million people.</p>
        <p>In current negotiations with his union, the Government side is pressing for a reduction in sick pay and the phasing out of a program that provides 3.2 million municipal workers with free pensions.</p>
        <p>The union, by contrast, wants a package of pay hikes and job security that it estimates would raise overall labor costs by 4.5 percent.</p>
        <p>What is really at issue, though, is the costly social guarantees that Germans take for granted.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, a bus driver with 16 years' service, Mr. Klumski said: Gross pay before stoppages, 4,067 marks ($2,260) a month (plus a 13th month's salary paid as a bonus); six weeks' paid vacation, and 10 days as paid public holidays.</p>
        <p>But the real value of the bus-driver's job lies in sums withheld that are matched 100 percent by the employer. That combined amount finances the health care, schooling, social security, sick pay, old-age care and unemployment benefits at the core of what modern Germans call the ''social market economy.''</p>
        <p>The sense that history's tide may be running against all that makes people like Mr. Klumski uneasy. ''They have been trying to cut our benefits for 20 years,'' he said. ''Now the pressure is more difficult to resist.''</p>
