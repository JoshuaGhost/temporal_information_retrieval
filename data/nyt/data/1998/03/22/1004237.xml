        <p>''CHAPTER ONE: He adored New York City. He idolized it all out of proportion. Uh, no. Make that: He romanticized it all out of proportion. Yeah. To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin. Uh, no. Let me start this over again.</p>
        <p>''Chapter One: He was too romantic about Manhattan. . . .''</p>
        <p>Like Woody Allen's tentative writer in his 1979 film, ''Manhattan,'' movie makers have struggled to grasp New York. Though many have tried, relatively few of their films have won Academy Awards. Since 1929, only 20 movies set in New York have captured at least one of the top six Oscars, for best picture, director and actors. They range from the breathless sophistication of ''All About Eve'' to the breathtaking brutality of ''Raging Bull,'' from the poignant ''Marty'' to the whimsical ''Annie Hall.''</p>
        <p>This year, the Oscar nominees include only one movie set in New York, ''As Good As It Gets'' (nominated for best picture; best actor, Jack Nicholson; best actress, Helen Hunt; and best supporting actor, Greg Kinnear). But the city seems incidental. ''It's not a New York movie,'' scoffed Edward I. Koch, former Mayor of New York and a part-time movie reviewer. ''It's an apartment movie.''</p>
        <p>The movie critic Andrew Sarris, a Columbia University professor and author of a forthcoming history of talkies called ''You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet,'' said Hollywood's view of New York has varied, in part because until the 1950's, most movies were shot on sound stages. ''To shoot on the streets of New York,'' Mr. Sarris said, ''meant you had to have a harsher New York than, say, 'Swing Time,' '' the 1936 Astaire-Rogers musical.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarris also said that New York movies shot in Manhattan were different from those shot in the other boroughs. ''Shoot in the Bronx or Brooklyn or Queens and you might as well shoot in Santa Monica,'' he said. ''Because the boroughs are spread out like Los Angeles. You need concentration to show that you're in the city and not in the country. You need a city to hide secrets, create certain kinds of conflict, provide drama.''</p>
        <p>One reason fewer movies are using New York as a central element is the expense and complexity of shooting in the city. But another reason, Mr. Sarris said, is that ''New York has become its own set of cliches; the sophisticate, the criminal, the Master of the Universe.''</p>
        <p>New York's problem may be that it has grown larger than cinematic life, or at least larger than movie characters. Bruce Feirstein, the screenwriter for the James Bond movie, ''Tomorrow Never Dies,'' considered setting some scenes in Manhattan. But he and the producers realized, he said, that ''New York was bigger than James Bond.''</p>
        <p>''Bond can show up in Prague, snap his fingers and everyone is impressed. But can you really see Bond showing up in Manhattan and owning the town?''</p>
