        <p>Dr Benjamin Spock's advice on baby and child care evolved in many ways over the years; excerpts from original 1946 edition of his book and more recent editions on the questions of diet, teeth, entertainment, aggression, spanking, sexism, work and fathers (M)</p>

        <p>DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK died last week at 94, just as his publisher, Pocket Books, was putting the final touches on a new edition of ''Baby and Child Care,'' the how-to manual whose phenomenal success placed him in the pantheon of one-name global icons like Einstein and Elvis. Like the 1946 original and the revisions of 1957, 1968, 1976, 1985 and 1992, the seventh edition, due out May 2 and co-written by Dr. Steven J. Parker, tries to keep up with the times, discussing pornographic Web sites, gay parents and bonded resin to fight tooth decay. But the book's optimistic credo (''Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.'') has not changed, and a comparison of the oldest and newest editions shows that many passages have passed through the generations virtually intact.</p>

        <p>DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK died last week at 94, just as his publisher, Pocket Books, was putting the final touches on a new edition of ''Baby and Child Care,'' the how-to manual whose phenomenal success placed him in the pantheon of one-name global icons like Einstein and Elvis. Like the 1946 original and the revisions of 1957, 1968, 1976, 1985 and 1992, the seventh edition, due out May 2 and co-written by Dr. Steven J. Parker, tries to keep up with the times, discussing pornographic Web sites, gay parents and bonded resin to fight tooth decay. But the book's optimistic credo (''Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.'') has not changed, and a comparison of the oldest and newest editions shows that many passages have passed through the generations virtually intact.</p>
        <p>Still, a half-century is a long time. The world babies are born into today is quite a different place from the one President Truman knew. Newer editions of the book are politically charged, even moralistic, a reflection of Dr. Spock's liberal activism and ambitions. Where the 1946 edition helped parents cope with children's fears of ''the dark, of dogs, of fire engines, of death, of cripples,'' the 1998 edition adds the fear of nuclear war. ''Parents can give their children partial reassurance if they can say, 'Yes, there is a danger but it need not happen if we all work politically for peace,' '' he writes. Other contrasts follow.</p>
        <p>LAWRENCE DOWNES</p>
        <p>Diet</p>
        <p>1946: Pork, veal, and ham have not been as frequently recommended for small children as beef, lamb, chicken, liver. However, you can give roast veal cautiously beginning at a year if you are serving it for the rest of the family. Roast pork can also be given cautiously at a year if the fat is cut off. . . . Better wait until 3 before beginning small amounts of ham (not fried), beef frankfurters and duck.</p>
        <p>1998: Children who grow up without developing a taste for meat, poultry or fish will carry a tremendous advantage through life. Their tastes will not be oriented toward these products, all of which contain fat and cholesterol that can contribute to weight problems, heart disease and some cancers. They will also be at much less risk of infection with the bacteria that often taint meat products.</p>
        <p>Teeth</p>
        <p>1946: The main purpose of brushing the teeth is to remove the lumps of food from around the teeth. The logical time is after meals, three times a day. . . . There is no proof that the green film which forms on some children's teeth is harmful.</p>
        <p>1998: I recommend that a child's teeth be carefully brushed after breakfast and before bedtime, with a daily flossing between adjoining teeth usually before the evening brushing.</p>
        <p>Entertainment</p>
        <p>1946: The comics are serious business. Conscientious parents often dread the comic strips and  comic books, thinking that they ruin their children's taste for good reading, fill their minds with morbid ideas, keep them indoors, interfere with homework and waste good money. All these accusations have a bit of truth in them. But when children show a universal craving for something, whether it's comics or candy or jazz, we've got to assume that it has a positive, constructive value for them. It may be wise to try to give them what they want in a better form, but it does no good for us to cluck like nervous hens.</p>
        <p>1998: There is a darker side to the world of computers. I'm speaking about the majority of computer games. Most of these are variations on the theme of kill (shoot, laser, karate kick, maim, beat up) the bad guys. The best that can be said of them is that they may help promote eye-hand coordination in children. The worst that can be said is that they sanction, and even promote, aggression and violent responses to conflict.</p>
        <p>Aggression</p>
        <p>1946: When your child at 2 bangs another over the head, or at 4 plays at shooting, or at 9 enjoys blood-and-thunder comic books, he is just passing through the necessary stages in the taming of his aggressive instincts that will make him a worthwhile citizen in the end. Let him be his age all along the way.</p>
        <p>1998: Is gun play good or bad for children? For many years I emphasized its harmlessness. When thoughtful parents expressed doubt about letting their children have pistols and other warlike toys . . . I'd explain that playing at war is a natural step in the disciplining of the aggression of young children. . . . But nowadays I'd give parents much more encouragement in their inclination to guide their child away from violence.</p>
        <p>Spanking</p>
        <p>1946: In the olden days children were spanked plenty, and nobody thought much about it. Then a reaction set in, and parents were taught that it was shameful. But that didn't settle everything. If an angry parent keeps himself from spanking, he may show his irritation in other ways, for instance, by nagging the child for half the day, or trying to make him feel deeply guilty. I'm not advocating spanking, but I think it is less poisonous than lengthy disapproval, because it clears the air for parent and child. You sometimes hear it recommended that you never spank a child in anger but wait until you have cooled off. That seems unnatural. It takes a pretty grim parent to whip a child when the anger is gone.</p>
        <p>1998: In the olden days, most children were spanked, on the assumption that this was necessary to make them behave. In the 20th century, as parents and professionals have studied children here and in other countries, they have come to realize that children can be well behaved, cooperative and polite without ever having been punished physically or in any other way.</p>
        <p>Sexism</p>
        <p>1946: I want to apologize to half the fathers and mothers who are going to read this book. I mean the parents whose baby is a girl. Everywhere I've called the baby him. I think girl babies are as wonderful as boy babies. But in every sentence I can't say her or him. . . . Why can't I call the baby her in at least half the book? I need her to refer to the mother. I hope the parents of girls will understand and forgive me.</p>
        <p>1976 (a change applied to all subsequent editions): The main reason for this third revision (fourth edition) of ''Baby and Child Care'' is to eliminate the sexist biases of the sort that help to create and perpetuate discrimination against girls and women. Earlier editions referred to the child of indeterminate sex as he. Though this in one sense is only a literary tradition, it, like many other traditions, implies that the masculine sex has some kind of priority.</p>
        <p>Work</p>
        <p>1946: To work or not to work? Some mothers have  to work to make a living. Usually their children turn out all right, because some reasonably good arrangement is made for their care. But others grow up neglected and maladjusted. It would save money in the end if the government paid a comfortable allowance to all mothers (of young children) who would otherwise be compelled to work.</p>
        <p>1998: Who will provide children with the affection, the firm guidance, and the responsiveness to their questions and achievements that good parents naturally give? The best situation is one in which the mother's and father's work schedules can be arranged so that both can work a reasonably full shift and yet one or the other can be at home for most of the day. . . . Another solution is for one or both parents to cut down to part-time jobs for two or three years until the child is mature enough to attend preschool or a day-care center. This is becoming more and more difficult, however, as families require two breadwinners to met the family expenses.</p>
        <p>Fathers</p>
        <p>1946: Some fathers have been brought up to think that the care of babies and children is the mother's job entirely. This is the wrong idea. You can be a warm father and a real man at the same time. . . . Of course, I don't mean that the father has to give just as many bottles or change just as many diapers as the mother. But it's fine for him to do these things occasionally. He might make the formula on Sunday.</p>
        <p>1998: Men, especially the husbands of women with outside jobs, have been participating increasingly in all aspects of home and child care. There is no reason why fathers shouldn't be able to do these jobs as well as mothers. . . . But the benefit may be lost if this work is done as a favor to the wife, since that implies that raising the child is not really the father's work but that he's merely being extraordinarily generous.</p>
