        <p>THIN as a pencil or thick as a cigar, asparagus is now at the height of its season. It can be steamed, boiled, grilled or roasted, and it can be cut up for pasta, sauteed and stir-fried.</p>
        <p>To prepare asparagus for cooking, snap off the stalks at the natural point where they break. It is not necessary to peel the stalks unless they are large and thick skinned. The tips cook more quickly than the stalks, so if you are stir-frying chopped asparagus, for example, the tips should be added toward the end.</p>
        <p>The condition of the bud is the key to choosing the best asparagus. It should be tightly furled, not wilted or going to seed. The stalks should be firm and straight and not dry at the cut end -- an indicator that it is not freshly harvested. The color should be a rich green, the scales bright green or tinged with purple. Choose spears that are the same size so they will cook evenly.</p>
        <p>The sulphur in asparagus affects the taste of wine, making it seem sweeter. A full-bodied white wine like gewurztraminer holds up well to it.</p>
        <p>Risotto With Asparagus And Ricotta Salata  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>2shallots, finely chopped</p>
        <p>2cups arborio rice</p>
        <p>1cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>About 7 cups hot chicken stock</p>
        <p>1pound asparagus</p>
        <p>1cup fresh green peas, shelled</p>
        <p>1tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan (plus more for passing at the table)</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/2pound ricotta salata cheese.</p>
        <p>1. In a heavy skillet, heat three tablespoons butter and add the shallots. Cook until soft. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until the grains become opaque and are thoroughly coated with the butter.</p>
        <p>2. Turn up heat and add white wine, stirring continuously. When evaporated, add hot chicken stock a ladle at a time and keep rice at a gentle simmer, stirring all the time.</p>
        <p>3. Cut the asparagus into one-inch slices on the diagonal. When the rice is still slightly hard in the middle (after about 15 minutes), stir in the asparagus and continue cooking, ladling in more stock, until the rice is al dente. It should be creamy, a little chewy but firm to the bite. Add the peas to the mixture about three minutes before the end of cooking.</p>
        <p>4. Off heat, stir in remaining tablespoon of butter, a tablespoon of Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle risotto with crumbled ricotta salata. Freshly grated Parmesan may be passed at the table.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Asparagus and Prosciutto Gratin of Fettuccine  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1pound medium asparagus</p>
        <p>3tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>2shallots, minced</p>
        <p>1/4pound prosciutto, diced</p>
        <p>3/4cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>1tablespoon fresh tarragon leaves, chopped</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1pound fettuccine</p>
        <p>About  3/4 cup toasted bread  crumbs</p>
        <p>2tablespoons grated Parmesan.</p>
        <p>1. Trim the tough ends of the stalks from the asparagus. With a vegetable peeler, pare away any tough skin from the lower half of the stalk. Cut the asparagus into inch-and-a-half pieces on the diagonal.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, bring six quarts salted water to boil for the fettuccine. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Steam the asparagus until barely tender. Set aside and keep warm.</p>
        <p>3. Melt the butter in a saute pan. Add the shallots and the prosciutto and saute until the shallots are soft. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Add the tarragon and cook five minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Add the asparagus and keep warm until the fettuccine is cooked.</p>
        <p>4. Cook the fettuccine until al dente. Add it to the sauce and toss. Drain and transfer to a buttered baking dish and sprinkle with bread crumbs and cheese. Bake about 15 minutes or until the top is golden brown.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
