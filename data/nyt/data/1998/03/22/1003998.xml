        <p>About a month ago, a raised traffic triangle at the confusing intersection of Jane Street, Eighth Avenue and West Fourth Street suddenly appeared, surrounded by two layers of S-shaped bicycle racks to prevent anyone from standing on it. Some residents found it to be a strange and hostile construction (photo at right).</p>
        <p>After a chorus of complaints, the Department of Transportation announced that the triangle was a work in progress. Then the bike racks were removed and replaced with a temporary fence (photo below), to protect passers-by from falling into a pit where a tree would be planted.</p>

        <p>About a month ago, a raised traffic triangle at the confusing intersection of Jane Street, Eighth Avenue and West Fourth Street suddenly appeared, surrounded by two layers of S-shaped bicycle racks to prevent anyone from standing on it. Some residents found it to be a strange and hostile construction (photo at right).</p>
        <p>After a chorus of complaints, the Department of Transportation announced that the triangle was a work in progress. Then the bike racks were removed and replaced with a temporary fence (photo below), to protect passers-by from falling into a pit where a tree would be planted.</p>
        <p>Last week, at an informal meeting with Community Board 2's traffic committee, the department unveiled a preliminary plan for an extended, more pedestrian-friendly triangle, which might be expanded north and east, with more greenery and additional crosswalks added (rendering at bottom). Northbound traffic might be rerouted from West Fourth Street to Eighth Avenue.</p>
        <p>The plan was greeted enthusiastically. ''It's a welcome development,'' said Arthur Strickler, district manager of Board 2.</p>
