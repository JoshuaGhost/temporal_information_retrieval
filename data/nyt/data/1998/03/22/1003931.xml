        <p>THE ''whoop'' nine days ago that thundered out of Rice Hall, a residential dormitory on Iona College's campus here, sounded as if the movie ''Animal House'' was being remade.

The Gaels had not been tournament bound since 1985,  which explained why Rice Hall and the bars on North Avenue here were crowded with Iona fans glued to television sets.</p>

        <p>THE ''whoop'' nine days ago that thundered out of Rice Hall, a residential dormitory on Iona College's campus here, sounded as if the movie ''Animal House'' was being remade. But inside, at midday, no toga party raged. Instead, more than 200 Iona students, faculty members and workers cheered, stomped and groaned to the big-screen image of their team playing Syracuse University in the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in Lexington, Ky.</p>
        <p>Two days before The Ionian, the campus paper, ran the headline  ''We're In.'' One of only 64 teams in the country to make the tournament, Iona's team, the Gaels, had qualified a week earlier by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament in Albany. The Gaels had not been tournament bound since 1985,  which explained why Rice Hall and the bars on North Avenue here were crowded with Iona fans glued to television sets.</p>
        <p>In the Gael Club in Rice Hall, every Iona basket or close-up of an Iona player was greeted with roars and clapping. Even as their team fell behind midway in the first half by 10 points, no one admitted doubting their classmates' chances of stealing a victory over the bigger and higher-ranked Orangemen of Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Chris Gomes, 19, a sophomore from Mahopac majoring in economics and political science, like many of his fellow students, was already looking past Syracuse to a prospective, Sweet-16 matchup with Duke University.</p>
        <p>''How many chances does a small school like this have of making a name for itself?'' he said. ''It'd be great for the school to play Duke.''</p>
        <p>Dave Graham, a security guard, liked Iona's chances even as they trailed 30-20. ''We've got a good bunch of kids,'' he said. ''They don't panic. They all walk around the campus together. They're a family. Syracuse will falter.''</p>
        <p>A few dynamic minutes later, Iona forged into the lead, and the Rice Hall crowd rose to its feet, stomping and chanting and seemingly making more noise than the Iona fans being televised from Lexington, Ky.</p>
        <p>The Iona surge added more gusto to the students' bold predictions for their team. Pierina Biundo, 19, a sophomore majoring in economics, said: ''This is extremely exciting. I can't wait to see them make it all the way to the Final Four.''</p>
        <p>Pete Montanez, 21, a senior sociology major, waved a March 3 issue of The Daily News and pointed to his picture on the back page where he was shown as one of the many Gael fans swarming the Iona players after they won the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament. ''If I can get on the back page of The Daily News,'' he said, ''we can win the championship.''</p>
        <p>Vinny DiNota, 20, a sophomore and an international decision technology major, said: ''This team has a lot more heart than any team I know. I think it's fate that they make it to the Final Four.''</p>
        <p>Louis Barbier, 21, a senior also majoring in international decision technology, said, ''We've got nothing to lose.''</p>
        <p>Nearby in the Mulcahy Center, the college athletics building, a group of staff members sat somewhat more calmly in the offices of the basketball coach, Tim Welsh, watching the game on television. It was Welsh, 36, who took over for his father, Jerry, three and a half years ago and turned Iona into a winner again. Primarily a commuter school of 3,500 undergraduate students, Iona was first put on the national basketball map by the legendary coach Jim Valvano in 1978 when he snatched the Gaels' current assistant coach, Jeff Ruland, away from the University of Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Iona amassed a 53-13 record over the next two seasons and its first and only victory in an National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament game in three attempts. So as the Gaels edged in front of Syracuse by 3 points in the second half of their fourth tournament game in the school's 46th basketball season, Dr. J. Morrow, a psychology professor and the psychologist for the athletics department, said with a sigh, ''I don't think I can survive 13 more minutes.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Van Meter, the school's public address announcer at Mulcahy for the last 29 years, paced the office,  announcing the names of the Iona players who scored as if it were a home game and he was behind the microphone. With Iona leading 61-60 and 24 seconds remaining, Dr. Morrow said, ''I think this is the most nervous I've been in some time.''</p>
        <p>Welsh had said a few days before the game that the N.C.A.A. tournament had grown into a national sporting frenzy because of the impact of television and ''the excitement of the upsets.'' Now his team was on the verge of pulling off one of the tournament's biggest upsets. March Madness, one of the tournament's many nicknames, had gripped Iona and out on the main quadrangle only a handful of students could be seen milling about.</p>
        <p>But at the finish, Marius Janeulis of Syracuse nailed a 3-point shot with a second remaining to squash Iona's Cinderella dreams. Tim Brando, announcing the game on CBS-TV, said of the contest's 15 lead changes, ''It's been Heartbreak Hotel to euphoria.''</p>
        <p>Iona clearly dwelled in Heartbreak Hotel. The pain sketched on the faces of Iona players on television was mirrored by staff members in the office. Dr. Morrow said quietly, ''I feel sick.''</p>
        <p>Outside, Tarance Rose, 25, a senior who played for the Iona team last year, called out to a friend across campus: ''Did you see the game? That was a heartbreaker.'' His friend, walking with his head down like so many other students on the suddenly silent campus, did not even look up to answer.</p>
