        <p>Alexander (Sandy) Rower, a grandson of Alexander Calder, takes a photograph off his corkboard. It's of three young men in a vaulted hall of the Miro Foundation in Barcelona, Spain. At Mr. Rower's elbow are Joan Punyet Miro and Manus Sweeney, one the grandson of the artist, the other the grandson of the eminent critic and curator James Johnson Sweeney.</p>
        <p>''We have a secret club of famous artists' grandchildren,'' Mr. Rower says, counting in his brother, Holton, and cousin, Shawn Davidson. ''The problems are the same.''</p>
        <p>And what problems are those?</p>
        <p>''They're secret,'' he says slyly.</p>
        <p>But not really. A glance around Mr. Rower's orderly offices vividly evokes the unbearable clutter of remembrance. Against the back wall of this low-ceilinged Colonial attic in the heart of town, bookshelves and cardboard boxes disgorge letters, notes, catalogues, photographs and memorabilia of one of the really famous grandfathers of modern art. A table holds a slew of stray documents.</p>
        <p>In adjacent rooms, fireproof filing cabinets secure a neatly catalogued, cross-referenced mountain of memories. Within manila folders, Alexander Calder, James Johnson Sweeney and Joan Miro smile at the camera in long-vanished friendship.</p>
        <p>''We're Calder Central, and we have 100,000 pieces of paper,'' says Mr. Rower.</p>
        <p>''Here, look at this.'' He holds up a sheet of paper covered with hasty blue-pen drawings of a spiral staircase. A corner is torn off as though the artist, after illustrating a favorite bit of architecture at lunch, had scribbled his telephone number for a friend. ''Now I have to figure out what this is,'' says Mr. Rower, ''and I have no idea.''</p>
        <p>It's a burden Mr. Rower has willingly assumed. Since 1987, when he was 24, he has been the sole editor of the Alexander Calder catalogue raisonne and head of the Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation, which was created to produce it. In effect, he is the final arbiter on issues of authenticity.</p>
        <p>The exhibition ''Alexander Calder: 1898-1976,'' which contains 250 works and opens at the National Gallery of Art in Washington next Sunday, the centennial of the artist's birth, has been shaped by its association with the Calder archives.</p>
        <p>The show's curator, Marla Prather, made extended forays to Woodstock and with Mr. Rower pored through the 16,000 works in the archives. The exhibition, which begins with pieces from 1909 when Calder was 11 years old, will be especially rich in the work of the 30's and 40's, emphasizing the flush of enthusiasm that inspired the ethereal wire sculptures, the witty circus figures and those gaily soaring mobiles. ''I want to make things that are fun to look at, that have no propaganda value whatsoever,'' Calder declared, and he make good on it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Prather says she is grateful for Mr. Rower's research: ''One thing that Sandy has that most art historians don't have is this intimate contact with the objects themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rower takes that intimacy for granted. His earliest memory, at age 2, places him at Lincoln Center, watching Calder direct the installation of the stabile ''Le Guichet.'' The two stood side by side: big bear, little bear. ''He was my grandfather,'' Mr. Rower says. ''I lived my life with him, until he died when I was 13.''</p>
        <p>He pulls out pictures of the kitchen in the Calder house in Roxbury, Conn. It's a large, warm room jammed with Calder handcrafts: a cupboard fashioned from art crates, a tray hammered from a flattened olive-oil can, a rack of spiraling wire grills. Half a dozen friends share the table with the Calder clan.</p>
        <p>The feast moved whenever Calder and his wife Louisa did. In New York, the Calders stayed with the Rowers: Mary Calder Rower and her husband, Howard, a real-estate developer, and their sons.</p>
        <p>Calder had begun his career in Paris in the 20's and later kept a house in Sache, in the Loire valley, a magnet for the Rowers, who bunked with Calder's other daughter, Sandra, her husband, Jean Davidson, and Shawn. A short dirt path led through vineyards to the Calder house and studio and a yard bristling with spiky stabiles.</p>
        <p>''We'd have meals together every day,'' Mr. Rower remembers. ''I'd go to the studio. That's what we did in the summer.''</p>
        <p>In the studio, Mr. Rower says, the prankster with a great sense of humor turned serious and methodical. ''My grandfather hated people visiting him when he was at work, but he loved having his grandkids there. My brother Holton and I would go in and make stuff. We had a weapons stage and made swords and a mask. My grandfather would observe us working and would come over and show us how to use a tool. He wanted us to know how he made things. That's one of the great assets I have in studying his work.''</p>
        <p>So why did Mr. Rower assume the monumental task of cataloguing his grandfather's life? ''I resonate with his work tremendously,'' he says. ''I love the 20's and 30's. I love Miro, Leger, Arp, Mondrian,'' his grandfather's friends. And, Mr. Rower adds, ''I haven't met anyone in my life as generous as he was.''</p>
        <p>In a film on Calder, created by Roger Sherman for the ''American Masters'' series on PBS (to be shown on June 17), Ellsworth Kelly talks about finding a $50 rent check on his table after a studio visit by Calder. In rare footage borrowed from the archive, the artist does a two-step with his wire sculpture of the dancer Josephine Baker. His former dealer Klaus Perls says, ''He never changed. He was always a child. And a very happy child.''</p>
        <p>When paradise is lost, its absence can fill a life. After his grandfather's death, Mr. Rower chose not to enter college. Instead, he set up his own photography studio in New York, partly to document Calder works for exhibition catalogues. With his brother, he began restoring Calder sculptures and consulting for conservators, something they had been doing informally since they were teen-agers.</p>
        <p>Creating the archive galvanized Mr. Rower. He and Holton (who has since left the project and gone back to his own painting) ransacked their mother's Rolodex for the names of family friends who might have letters, papers or art. They wrote to museums and dealers. And they searched all the houses and studios, digging in attics and filing cabinets.</p>
        <p>Pulling out a French cookie tin stamped Punchs, Mr. Rower points to the pile of letters in it. ''I have dozens of these tins,'' he says. ''I don't even know what's in this one. Those papers are from the end of my grandfather's life, when he was eating these cookies. They are much less important for me than the earliest papers,'' which he has already filed.</p>
        <p>THE harder job was to sort out the snarl in Calder's studio in the Rue de la Colonie in Paris. A photograph, which Mr. Rower has dated 1931, presents the 33-year-old artist beneath a shelf that holds a hopeless jumble of wire. Mr. Rower says he has identified every wire sculpture in the tangle. ''In some cases we don't know what the work is, but I have made a drawing of it.''</p>
        <p>Tending his grandfather's memory, he has discovered his calling. ''I feel extremely rich when I have taken a box of papers and classified them,'' he says. ''As a box of papers, they don't exist. As classified documents, they are an extremely valuable resource.''</p>
        <p>There are wrongs to be righted: wrong titles, wrong dates, wrong attributions. The urgency is hard to explain to strangers. ''I felt that someone had to dedicate some energy to my grandfather's memory and his work,'' Mr. Rower says. ''I'm very frustrated that in the last 20 years his work has been minimized by people who think he's an artist of the 60's. Calder is not a contemporary of Warhol and Johns. Calder is an artist of the 30's. It's very important to me that my grandfather's work is understood within its context and also its original intentions.''</p>
        <p>And there is magic: the right piece of information that falls into his hands at just the right moment. ''I'm not a religious person, but it's like he's guiding me,'' Mr. Rower says. ''It's really strange. I don't know how to explain it. I certainly feel his energy in his papers and his work, and it's greatly rewarding to me.''</p>
        <p>The bonds among grandchildren have helped bring Miro's and Sweeney's papers into the archive. ''Each generation of famous artists' families has particular issues in common,'' Mr. Rower explains.</p>
        <p>''My relationship with both my grandparents was extremely dear, but I didn't have the complexities of being a son. I could just completely adore them. It's that kind of devotion that makes me able to persist through the muck and stress.''</p>
        <p>Yet stress is not what his face shows; rather, guarded strength and perhaps a flicker of steely defender's resolve.  ART</p>
