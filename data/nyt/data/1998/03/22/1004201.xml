        <p>President Clinton's lawyers and public relations staff spent the week fighting back against the legal team seeking to prove he sexually harassed Paula Jones at an Arkansas hotel in 1991.</p>
        <p>After Kathleen E. Willey appeared on  ''60 Minutes'' and haltingly described an alleged effort by the President to force himself on her sexually in 1993, the President's staff quickly released cordial correspondence from her to Mr. Clinton in the years after the meeting, in which she  revealed not a hint of anger.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the matter of Ms. Jones retook center stage when the President's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, submitted his  detailed court argument asking the judge to dismiss the case as baseless.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he retreated from a tactic he had threatened to pursue: introducing evidence about Ms. Jones's own sex life as part of the defense. The White House has shrunk from that course, which could offend women. But Mr. Bennett pointedly did not foreswear it forever.</p>
