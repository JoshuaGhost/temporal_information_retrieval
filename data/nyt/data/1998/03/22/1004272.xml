        <p>THE MAN WHO STOLE</p>
        <p>THE MONA LISA</p>
        <p>By Robert Noah.</p>
        <p>St. Martin's, $22.95.</p>
        <p>The television producer Robert Noah's second novel is based on the real-life theft of the ''Mona Lisa'' in 1911. In his version of the story, Leonardo's famous portrait is spirited away by a group of swindlers led by an Edwardian dandy known as the Marquis de Valfierno, a Uruguayan whose title of nobility is his own invention. This picaresque fraternity makes its living by selling copies of great paintings to wealthy clients, mostly Americans, who believe they are buying stolen originals. In order to pull off these transactions, Valfierno must convince the buyers that the ravaged museums, silenced by ignorance or embarrassment, are now exhibiting fakes as if they were real. Luckily for him, credulity seems to increase in direct proportion to wealth, and none of his customers ever complain. The crowning achievement of Valfierno's career is to steal and then sell the ''Mona Lisa'' -- or, more precisely, its counterfeited sisters -- not just once but five times over. The fate of the original, and the story of how it finds its way back to the Louvre, is the comic high point of the book. Unfortunately, ''The Man Who Stole the Mona Lisa'' is stylistically awkward (''As may well be imagined, the mention of this distinguished clientele had stirred responsive ripples in Mme. Valency''); it also suffers from having followed the ''known facts of the theft'' instead of elaborating fictional devices that might have given it a more satisfying form.</p>
