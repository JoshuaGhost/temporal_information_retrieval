        <p>For one brief shining moment, Lake Champlain reigned as one of the Great Lakes. Never mind that the sliver of fresh water between Vermont and New York was just one-fifteenth the size of Lake Ontario, the smallest of the five true Great Lakes. A bit of legislative legerdemain by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont -- approved by Congress and signed March 6 by the President -- magically conferred Greatness so that Vermont could get some Federal research money.</p>

        <p>But the Five Big Ones didn't want the pond in their exclusive club, and last week, Mr. Leahy made a peace offering. Congress could snatch back the ''Great'' label but would still allow Vermont to compete for the money. The Senate unanimously voted to revoke the title. The House is to vote soon.</p>
