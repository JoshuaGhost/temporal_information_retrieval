        <p>A lot of my fellow road warriors join me in saying thank you for noticing the life style of some of us (''Business Class as a Way of Life,'' A Special Issue, March 8). It is a difficult life style, but one that is getting easier with E-mail and cellular phones that can follow you. In the early 80's, when businessmen like myself would go into mainland China or Russia or even Mexico, it was as if we were going into outer space. No one could find us.

        <p>The untold story, though, of people on the road is the loss of marriages, the loneliness and the feeling of being virtual that comes when E-mail is your only connection to family and friends. Thank you for this great issue that lets others into our world.</p>
