        <p>ON the streets of Paris in 1950, two dreamy people, among oblivious strangers, stopped for one stolen kiss, an instinctual response to the impulse of love. It took a great photographer, Robert Doisneau, to implant that kiss in time and memory. Virtually everyone has seen the picture -- on posters, on postcards, on calendars, even on pillow cases.</p>
        <p>But is it truly the representation of a seized moment, spontaneously caught by a swift on-the-spot photographer? Or is it an inspired artifice, set up by a shrewd and visionary artist who just happened to engage two perfect models as pretend lovers? There is an answer, legally speaking, from an actual 1993 court case in Paris, if anyone wants to hear it. Clearly, the playwright Joe DiPietro doesn't want us to. For the picture is a thing of beauty, forever to induce a sigh, never to be questioned.</p>

        <p>ON the streets of Paris in 1950, two dreamy people, among oblivious strangers, stopped for one stolen kiss, an instinctual response to the impulse of love. It took a great photographer, Robert Doisneau, to implant that kiss in time and memory. Virtually everyone has seen the picture -- on posters, on postcards, on calendars, even on pillow cases.</p>
        <p>But is it truly the representation of a seized moment, spontaneously caught by a swift on-the-spot photographer? Or is it an inspired artifice, set up by a shrewd and visionary artist who just happened to engage two perfect models as pretend lovers? There is an answer, legally speaking, from an actual 1993 court case in Paris, if anyone wants to hear it. Clearly, the playwright Joe DiPietro doesn't want us to. For the picture is a thing of beauty, forever to induce a sigh, never to be questioned.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. DiPietro, a native of  Oradell, is presenting all possibilities in ''The Kiss at City Hall.''  The play is having its premiere at American Stage Company, where a copy of the picture hangs in the lobby.</p>
        <p>No courtroom drama and no exercise in dialectics, the play uses the picture as a device, or one could say as a frame, for a romantic comedy filled with contemporary angst. Mr. DiPietro cleverly intersperses imagined court testimony about the picture's authenticity by four characters navigating the perils of commitment. In the process, they speak for a generation hooked on analysis, both psychiatric and intellectual, at the expense of experience.</p>
        <p>Tony, a carpenter who broods, and Dave, a joker who makes a living appearing in television commercials and likes it, are roommates. (''How come I'm not more embarrassed by what I do?'' Dave wonders.) Julie, a high-powered marketing executive, wants to marry Tony. Phoenix, a junior high school teacher, wants to marry Dave. Neither man can say yes.</p>
        <p>''I've been single all my life and totally happy, except for my entire childhood,'' Dave says. Between bedroom, living room and kitchen scenes, Julie and Tony and Dave and Phoenix take turns defending or denouncing the picture, depending on the state of their relationships at the moment. ''Your honor, this kiss is real,'' Julies says one moment, ''it is a fake'' the next. ''Don't look at the picture; listen to it,'' Tony testifies when he is enraptured. Phoenix insists when she has withdrawn her proposal: ''These people are acting. It is a cruel, cruel lie.''</p>
        <p>But the play's anchor is Mrs. Valentini, an Italian cleaning woman who speaks only two unexpected and unfunny English words. They are also unrelated to the plight of Tom and Dave, who unload their problems on her.  Tellingly, she doesn't understand a word. More tellingly, what she understands is beyond words.</p>
        <p>Beneath the play's audience-wowing comedy, some of it on the level of a pretty good sitcom, and the frivolous air successfully imparted by the director, Joel Bishoff, the author is asking questions, from the obvious but valid (why is the truth never as simple as a picture?) to the implied but obvious (yes, art is better and truer than life). And he establishes a warm and genuine friendship between two men. This is a welcome, sensitive novelty in theater.</p>
        <p>In an amiable cast, Jim Bracchitta glides right into the standout role of Dave, an entertaining, manic and quick-witted jerk who is lucky enough to have a breakthrough before a breakdown. ''Reality is much more entertaining if you make it up,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Although one would rather be spared some of the lovers' squabbles, ''The Kiss at City Hall'' flows glibly, encompassing essential illusions and unreal aspirations. Call it an easy winner.</p>
