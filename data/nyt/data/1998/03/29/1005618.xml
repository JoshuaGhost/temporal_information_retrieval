        <p>SINCE last September, Gayle King has added to her celebrity as co-anchor of WFSB's 5:30 P.M. news and Oprah Winfrey's best friend. That's because Ms. King, 43 years old, is also  seen weekdays on 205 television stations as the host of ''The Gayle King Show,'' a half-hour production by Eyemark Entertainment done as a companion to the ''Martha Stewart Living'' show.</p>
        <p>After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in psychology, Ms. King began her television news career as a production assistant in Washington, D.C., and met Ms. Winfrey, then a news anchor, in Baltimore in 1976. In 1981, Ms. King arrived in Hartford at WFSB, the local CBS affiliate, leaving only briefly to co-host a short-lived daytime talk show called ''Cover to Cover'' with Maury Povich on NBC.</p>

        <p>SINCE last September, Gayle King has added to her celebrity as co-anchor of WFSB's 5:30 P.M. news and Oprah Winfrey's best friend. That's because Ms. King, 43 years old, is also  seen weekdays on 205 television stations as the host of ''The Gayle King Show,'' a half-hour production by Eyemark Entertainment done as a companion to the ''Martha Stewart Living'' show.</p>
        <p>After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in psychology, Ms. King began her television news career as a production assistant in Washington, D.C., and met Ms. Winfrey, then a news anchor, in Baltimore in 1976. In 1981, Ms. King arrived in Hartford at WFSB, the local CBS affiliate, leaving only briefly to co-host a short-lived daytime talk show called ''Cover to Cover'' with Maury Povich on NBC.</p>
        <p>A divorced mother of two children -- Kirby, 11, and William, 10 -- Ms. King has days that are a blur of activity.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview at her WFSB office -- just 169 steps from ''The Gayle King Show'' studio, as measured by her son -- Ms. King opened a bottle of apple juice and discussed how her life and work have changed. Following are excerpts from that conversation.</p>
        <p>Q.  Why would you want to start a second job when you already have an established career and you had tried a talk show before?</p>
        <p>A. I'm still happy doing the news, minding my own business and taking care of me and the kids. But when they came to me and presented this proposal for a companion show with Martha Stewart, there was something very intriguing about that.</p>
        <p>I said I'd like to try it but I have to stay in Hartford, which I really thought would be the beginning and the end of the conversation. Not only did they say yes, but they built the studio right here. They made it as convenient as possible.</p>
        <p>You're right. I had tried it in New York and it didn't work. But I believe in life you have to take a risk. I don't think you ever take a foolish risk. If they had said, ''If it doesn't work in 13 weeks you're outta here,'' I wouldn't have done it. But I was led to believe we're going to be on for at least a year.</p>
        <p>Q.  There are those who would say you can't, or shouldn't, be both a journalist and a talk show host.</p>
        <p>A. It would bother me if I was doing something I call spectacle television -- I slept with my sister's husband, you fathered my baby, or my favorite, he's not my grandson, he's my lover. If I was doing those kind of things and then coming on to say, ''Good Evening, Governor Rowland . . . blah blah blah,'' that would be a problem. But because of the kind of show we're doing, I don't feel any conflict.</p>
        <p>Q. What criticism of television being more entertainment than news?</p>
        <p>A. I think that's the reality. The days of just give me the news -- just the facts -- is not what TV news is anymore. People keep thinking that's what it is, or what it's supposed to be. But that's not what people are watching. TV always responds to what the people want.  Some people blame the media, but we take our cues from you. And you let us know what you want by the ratings. It's very simple to me.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you approach this talk show differently than the last time?</p>
        <p>A. This show has my name on it. I feel a lot more pressure because nobody wants to fail when it's your name and your face. I wasn't happy ''Cover To Cover'' was canceled. But I know that's how this business goes.</p>
        <p>But I also know if it doesn't work for me, it is not the end of the world.  This job is not the end all, be all for me. It really isn't. I like what I do very much. I also know that one day, sad but true, I'm going to be a trivia question -- ''What was the name of that black girl? Carol King?'' I never intend to be a trivia question to my children, so everything I do is based on how I can make it work. Do we have a basketball game tonight? Do I have to go to the school play?</p>
        <p>I have a thing with the children that I like to be the first thing they see in the morning and the last thing they see at night. I'm working longer hours, so they get to stay up half an hour later. They think that's kind of cool.</p>
        <p>Q. Is the balancing act the hardest part of what you're doing now or is it adjusting to do two different jobs?</p>
        <p>A. I don't feel I have to make this big transition. Honest, when I get done over here, I just schlep over there, get my news copy and start writing. The person that I am doesn't change. Am I doing much more balancing? Absolutely. I feel like I'm juggling balls. I've left the house wearing two different shoes. Or I'm at the airport when I realize I forgot something. So I'm on the plane calling. I never did stuff like that before.  I'm now writing down stuff a whole lot more.</p>
        <p>Q.  You're now responsible for coming up with more than 230 ideas for shows. How much are you driving what your staff is doing, from ideas to visual presentation?</p>
        <p>A. I like to think it's a team effort. I couldn't do this by myself. It doesn't matter how good you are if you don't have a good, strong support system right down to the camera person, the director, the producers. I'm the front person that you see. But I'm not this creative person that comes up with ideas. If you give me an idea and I like it, I can execute it.</p>
        <p>I come to work like a shlub. I get here, my hair's still wet. I'm wearing a little house dress and flippy flops. They wave a little magic wand and I look like the girl on the cover of the magazine. It's fabulous.</p>
        <p>Q. Being on television in Hartford is one thing. Being on a nationally syndicated program is another. Does it feel different?</p>
        <p>A. It doesn't because I'm still going to the grocery store, I'm still pumping the gas and I'm still driving the kids to school every day. I can't say that I feel differently as a person.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there anything different with your children as a result of all this?</p>
        <p>A. No. Their whole lives all I've done is be on TV. That's what mom does. It's not a big deal to them.</p>
        <p>Q. You were a psychology major in college. Do you use any of that training as an interviewer?</p>
        <p>A. No, even though you run into a lot of wacko people in this business. I think one of my biggest assets is that from the time I was a little kid, I asked a lot of questions. They used to call it being nosy. I prefer to call it inquisitive. It's not psychology, it's  natural curiosity. I'm fascinated with what people do, why they do it and how they do it.</p>
        <p>Q. The talk show format can get out there in terms of sensationalism. You've said that you don't want to embarrass anyone. How are you doing on that?</p>
        <p>A. There are some places I will not go, even though I see the ratings shooting through the roof. I'm not going to do something I'm uncomfortable with just to get a number. I'm not doing that.</p>
        <p>Q.  What's been the hardest part of doing the talk show format?</p>
        <p>A. It's a lot more grueling than I thought. You can have a good show, but you can't even savor or relish it because you know you better come up with something else tomorrow. Today is forgotten.</p>
        <p>Q. How long do you think you can keep going at this pace?</p>
        <p>A. I don't know. That's not something I think about. It's bearable because I really like it.</p>
        <p>Q. You've said your goals for the show are to entertain, inform and enlighten. Are you doing that?</p>
        <p>A. I try to have fun every day. I love to laugh. The thing that seems to work best for us is when people feel they've gotten some type of information. It's such a kick to me to go out on the street and people come up to me and say, ''I saw your show and I learned something.'' I look forward to the day when it's common that people say, ''Hey did you see Gayle today?'' That's my ultimate goal -- a show that people talk about and tell their friends you've got to watch.</p>
        <p>It takes time. Other shows, most of them didn't really click until their third or fourth season. Unfortunately, today, they don't let you go three or four seasons. You've got to click right away or you're in trouble.</p>
        <p>Q. If you weren't doing television, what would you do?</p>
        <p>A. I would love to sing. I'd love to be on stage and people knowing my song. But I have a terrible voice and I know that.</p>
        <p>If I weren't doing this, it would have to be something that would allow me to work with people. No matter what I would do, I would be decent at it. I don't like doing things halfway. I don't like being mediocre.</p>
        <p>Q.  Does it bother you still being so connected to Oprah?</p>
        <p>A. No! Who doesn't want to be her best friend? If I didn't think I brought something to the table, or if I wasn't secure enough with myself then maybe it would bother me. But you know, I've been anchoring the news for a long time. I won three Emmys. I've proven that I can do that. I never feel I'm in her shadow. I feel I'm in her light, that's how I look at it.</p>
