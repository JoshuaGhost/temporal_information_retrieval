        <p>While other teenagers might devote their Wednesday evenings to watching ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' on television, or eating pizza with friends, Heather Snook, 17, would much rather sit in a darkened auditorium at a medical school here, listening to a doctor expound on such topics as ''Vogelstein's Genetic Model for Colorectal Tumorigenesis.''</p>

        <p>While other teenagers might devote their Wednesday evenings to watching ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' on television, or eating pizza with friends, Heather Snook, 17, would much rather sit in a darkened auditorium at a medical school here, listening to a doctor expound on such topics as ''Vogelstein's Genetic Model for Colorectal Tumorigenesis.''</p>
        <p>''I love this stuff,'' said Heather, who plans to go to medical school and was carrying her high school human biology textbook with her.</p>
        <p>Heather isn't alone. When the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School here advertised that it would offer an eight-week ''mini-medical school,'' some 300 people applied for the 150 slots. One woman called after the deadline and pleaded to be let into this class instead of waiting for the one planned next fall because ''I'm 76 and I might not be around next year,'' an official of the medical school said.</p>
        <p>Some of those enrolled are high school students like Heather, who plan to go to medical school. A couple are as young as 11 and 12. Many are older people with an interest in learning more about their own health.</p>
        <p>''We're a school, so our primary mission is to teach,'' said Dr. Harold L. Paz, dean of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, which is part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. ''I don't see that ending with the medical students or the residents and interns. There's no reason why we shouldn't educate lay people too.''</p>
        <p>In the eight-week course here, the ''students'' hear lectures from the same doctors who teach at the school. Such exposure, Dr. Paz said, will make people better partners with their doctors when they are ill. ''When you educate patients,'' he said, ''they're going to be better prepared to participate in the care they receive, and that makes for a better doctor-patient relationship.''</p>
        <p>The curriculum includes such topics as ''The Heart: Prevention and Treatment of Disease,'' ''Women's Health'' and ''New Approaches in Surgery.'' Last week the theme  was ''Cancer, a Treatable Disease.''</p>
        <p>Someone asked about the value of using shark cartilage to treat cancer. ''Shark cartilage was has not shown to be effective in clinical trials,'' said Dr. Mary Todd, a faculty member at the school and the deputy director of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. But she told the audience that researchers have conducted controlled clinical trials on a variety of possible cancer cures found in the rain forest, or used by other cultures.</p>
        <p>''We're all trying to find ways to help people who are very sick,'' said Dr. Eric Rubin, the director of clinical pharmacology at the Cancer Institute. ''We'll try anything. There is no conspiracy or attempt to ignore holistic approaches or anything.''</p>
        <p>Some of the discussions, such as on the genetic qualities of cancer cells, left some of those in the audience overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately a lot of this is over my head,'' said Arthur Albohn, a chemical engineer who is 76 years old and was attending the lectures with his wife. But he said that he still enjoyed the classes, adding, ''It's not often that you get the chance, once you are out of college, to listen to people who are so knowledgeable about a subject.''</p>
        <p>Bill Morgan, who will be 68 in a few months, lost a son to bone marrow cancer 18 years ago. Then, he lost his first wife to breast cancer. He himself had prostate cancer, but doctors say he is clear of it now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgan and his current wife Barbara, who live in Avenel, have more than a passing interest in medical research. ''You want to know what's the latest,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''I have these cancers floating around in me. You want to protect yourself, live one more day. It may not help, but it's certainly not going to do any harm.''</p>
        <p>Even though Heather said she attends the sessions for the love of science, she is also thinking ahead to the competitive process of getting into medical school. ''It's going to look really good on my pre-med application that I'm interested now,'' she said.</p>
