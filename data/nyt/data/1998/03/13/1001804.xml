        <p>In a setback for the White House, a Presidential advisory commission declined today to endorse the use of legislation to define and enforce the rights of patients who have been improperly denied health care benefits promised by insurance companies and employers.</p>
        <p>The panel agreed without dissent on the need for a renewed commitment to improving the quality of health care in America. But it left open the possibility that voluntary efforts could achieve that goal without new Federal laws.</p>
        <p>At its final meeting today, the 34-member panel sidestepped the politically explosive question of whether to authorize compensation or create  additional legal remedies for patients who suffer at the hands of insurance companies and health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>The panel, headed by the Secretaries of Labor and of Health and Human Services, included representatives of the insurance industry, as well as consumer advocates, doctors, nurses, lawyers, business executives and labor union leaders.</p>
        <p>The panel worked by consensus, requiring virtual unanimity for any major recommendation, and there was nothing approaching unanimity on the issue of enforcement.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, a White House aide, welcomed the commission's report, but said its recommendations should be enacted into law.</p>
        <p>''The commission recommended that consumer protections be provided to all Americans,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''The President believes that cannot be achieved without Federal legislation.''</p>
        <p>The battle now shifts to Congress, where Democrats and some Republicans insist that new laws are needed to define and enforce patients' rights.</p>
        <p>The proposed bill of rights would provide patients with access to medical specialists and emergency room services, protect the confidentiality of medical records and establish procedures for patients to appeal the denial of health benefits.</p>
        <p>President Clinton plans to intensify his push for legislation when he accepts the commission's report at a White House ceremony on Friday, his aides said. Three days ago, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Congress would probably pass ''some kind of patient protection bill'' this year.</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates, doctors and some labor leaders on the commission argued that the Federal Government must regulate health insurance, as it regulates television or the securities industry in the public interest. Insurance executives and employers of all sizes opposed new regulation, saying it would raise the cost of coverage so that more people would be uninsured.</p>
        <p>But the Congressional Budget Office said compliance with the bill of rights would raise employers' health insurance premiums by just three-fourths of 1 percent, on the average. The budget office estimated that employers will spend $288 billion on health benefits this year.</p>
        <p>In its final report, the commission watered down earlier language that called for new laws to deter ''egregious behavior by health plan sponsors and administrators.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the panel said ''policy makers should engage in a national dialogue regarding the state of existing remedies for individuals in public or private plans who are injured as a result of inappropriate health care decisions.''</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, put the best face on the outcome, saying the panel had fostered ''civilized discussion'' on issues of importance to consumers.</p>
        <p>But Kathleen Sebelius, the insurance commissioner for Kansas, said the panel reached a ''roadblock, there was no consensus'' on how to enforce the patient's bill of rights.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader, said the panel, ''unlike the President who appointed its members, did not call on Congress to enact the patient's bill of rights into law.''</p>
        <p>Donald A. Danner, vice president of the National Federation of Independent Business, seized on the impasse as evidence that Government ''mandates are the wrong prescription for America's health care system.'' But his judgment that Mr. Clinton's push for legislation to enforce the bill of rights had come to ''a screeching halt'' seemed premature.</p>
        <p>The panel's report said that ''licensing, accreditation and certification organizations have experience'' in monitoring compliance with health care standards. So, it said, it is reasonable to expect them to assess compliance with the bill of rights. as well.</p>
        <p>A separate advisory panel, studying ways to save the Medicare program, met last week for the first time. The head of that panel, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, has said that Congress should defer action this year on Mr. Clinton's proposal to open Medicare to people 55 to 64 years old. But White House officials continue pressing Congress to approve the change.</p>
