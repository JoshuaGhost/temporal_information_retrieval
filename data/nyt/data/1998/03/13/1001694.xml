        <p>You can find fast food on almost any block in New York City: a burger, a street hot dog, a sandwich from a deli display case. Why settle for these? Here are a dozen alternatives that serve food fast and tasty. (These summaries, written by Eric Asimov, are from Ruth Reichl's and Mr. Asimov's dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times.)</p>
        <p>1. Cosi Sandwich Bar  +  (212) 949-7400  38 East 45th Street  Manhattan  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>Cosi, one of four branches in Manhattan, is a sleek, stylish assembly line for building sandwiches to your personal specifications. As you line up at the sandwich counter, you can stare into the flame of a towering metal oven where Cosi's crisp Roman flatbread is baked. The bread, tasting of olive oil and salt and wonderful by itself, is the constant: you can choose one, two or three fillings, like tandoori chicken, coriander-roasted tomatoes or sun-dried tomato spread. Cosi's other branches are at 11 West 42d Street, 165 East 52d Street and 60 East 56th Street.</p>

        <p>2. Elvie's Turo-Turo  +  (212) 473-7785  214 First Avenue, near 13th Street  East Village  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>At Elvie's, a tiny storefront Filipino restaurant near Beth Israel Hospital, the day's selections are set out on a steam table buffet style. The name Turo-Turo is a traditional restaurant term in the Philippines meaning ''point, point,'' and that's exactly what you do. This is not light cuisine, with more than a dozen selections, primarily beef and pork with occasional chicken and fish dishes. Adobo, tender chunks of marinated pork, is the national dish of the Philippines and always good, as are pancit, stir-fried egg or rice noodles served with bits of chicken and shrimp, and diced spareribs. For dessert, point to sweet cassava cake.</p>
        <p>3. Fresco Tortilla Grill  +  (212) 475-7380  36 Lexington Avenue, near 24th Street  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>The soft tacos are remarkably good at this tiny storefront takeout shop, and the prices are remarkably low. The taco al carbon, tender sliced steak wrapped in a soft tortilla, is simple and delicious, as are the tacos with ground chorizo, black beans and chili con carne. Quesadillas, fajitas and sincronizadas, which are like sandwiches made with two tortillas held together by melted Monterey Jack cheese and various fillings, are also good. Fresco has been so successful that it has a legion of branches and imitators too numerous to list, all named Fresco Tortilla, Fresco Taco, Fresh Tortilla or some other variant.</p>
        <p>4. Lola Bowla  +  (212) 675-6700  30 West 22d Street  Chelsea  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>Lola Bowla, an offshoot of the restaurant Lola, is open only weekdays at lunch and is that rare gimmicky restaurant that works. Simply put, everything from salad to sweets is served in bowls. It's fast and stylish, and the menu includes plenty of noodle dishes, like thin egg noodles with clams, roast pork and black bean sauce, and vermicelli noodles in a spicy shrimp soup with crab-meat dumplings. You can be in and out in under an hour.</p>
        <p>5. Mama's Food Shop  +  (212) 777-4425  200 East Third Street, at Avenue B  East Village  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>Mama's is a simple place with home-style American cooking and room for no more than 20 people. You go to the counter and point at what you want, and it is dished up. The main courses are mostly meat dishes, and they are fine, like moist, savory meatloaf, flavorful grilled salmon and fried chicken. But the vegetable side dishes really shine. Brussels sprouts have rarely tasted so good, split and charred and flavored with garlic. Carrots and beets are sliced thin and roasted until they are bursting with sweetness. And Mama's mashed potatoes are ethereal. Portions of the homey desserts are gargantuan, like apple cobbler, rich chocolate-banana-bread pudding and orange bundt.</p>
        <p>6. Mee Noodle Shop and Grill  +  (212) 888-0027  922 Second Avenue, at 49th Street  Manhattan  $ American Express</p>
        <p>This branch of Mee, one of three in Manhattan, shows how good simple Chinese food can be when prepared with care and attention. Mee excels with noodles, offering seven kinds. Two of the best are lo mein noodles with paper-thin slices of red-edged roast pork, and chicken mee fun, a cloud of rice noodles served with chicken breast and soy sauce. Warning: portions are huge. The other branches are at 795 Ninth Avenue, at 53d Street in Clinton, and at 219 First Avenue, at 13th Street in the East Village.</p>
        <p>7. Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too  +  (212) 865-6744  366 Cathedral Parkway  Morningside Heights  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>Miss Mamie's offers simple down-home Southern food based on recipes from the book ''Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine,'' written by the owner, Norma Jean Darden, and Carole Darden Lloyd, her sister. While Miss Mamie's is largely a takeout operation, you are welcome to sit with your food at one of the room's pleasant yellow tables as long as you don't mind plastic utensils and plastic foam containers. This is rich, hearty food, and as in most Southern restaurants, you get plenty of it; each entree comes with two large side dishes. The best selections are the meat dishes, like wonderfully tender short ribs of beef and sweet yet peppery North Carolina pork ribs. Side dishes are all fine as well.</p>
        <p>8. Naples 45  +++  (212) 972-7001  200 Park Avenue (entrance on 45th Street between Lexington and Vanderbilt Avenues)  Manhattan  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>Naples 45, at the north end of Grand Central Terminal, is large, loud and reasonably priced. The food is cooked with imagination and presented with heart, just as you'd want to see in a fast-paced Italian spot. The menu includes a wide selection of pizzas, sized for individuals or for groups, and little bites, like calamari salad; vegetable croquettes with goat cheese; grilled octopus salad, and grilled sausage with peppers. Naples 45 also serves pastas and main courses and offers an extensive list of wines by the glass.</p>
        <p>9. Republic  ++  (212) 579-5959  2290 Broadway, near 83d Street  Manhattan  $ All major cards</p>
        <p>Republic, which specializes in Asian noodles, makes no claims to authenticity, but the food is fresh and well conceived, and the ethnic antecedents of most dishes are clear. Among the best noodle choices are slices of grilled beef marinated with galanga and mint and served on rice noodles, thin slices of pork marinated in garlic and soy and served on cold vermicelli, and strips of spicy chicken served in a rich Thai-style broth laced with coconut milk. Food is served quickly, and the backless benches, comfortable enough for a fast meal, don't encourage lingering. This is the  less crowded of Republic's two Manhattan branches; the other is at 37 Union Square West, near 16th Street.</p>
        <p>10. Ruben's Empanadas  +  (212) 334-3351  505 Broome Street, near West  Broadway  SoHo  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>From Cornish pasties to Jamaican meat patties, meat-filled pastries are found the world over. Empanadas are the South American version. Ruben's, a trim, clean storefront, is just right for grabbing a quick meal. A couple of empanadas, perfectly turned crusts that are crisp around the edges and plump with spicy chicken, savory Argentine sausage or other fillings, make a fine fast lunch.</p>
        <p>11. Soul Fixins'  +  (212) 736-1345  371 West 34th Street  Manhattan  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>If you like, you can pull up a chair at Soul Fixins' if any of the dozen or so seats are available in this small storefront near Ninth Avenue. But this kind of Southern food travels well, and it's nice to be able to spread out in comfort at home, especially with a dish like meaty barbecued spareribs bathed in a gloriously smoky sauce that requires you to towel down afterward. The crisp fried chicken is superior to chicken smothered in an oniony brown sauce. Side dishes (two come with each main course) are uniformly good, from the collard greens and green beans, both in tangy vinegar sauces, to the candied yams, fragrant with clove and nutmeg.</p>
        <p>12. Urban Hero  +  (212) 719-0665  245 West 38th Street  Manhattan  $ Cash only</p>
        <p>Urban Hero, a bare-bones, largely takeout spot in the garment district, specializes in inventive low-fat sausages. Sausages are all made with fresh chicken breast or turkey breast, many blended with fruit to preserve the sausage's juicy snap, usually provided by fat. The homey Vermont sausage is made with cranberries and maple syrup, while the zesty baha is made with chilies, cilantro and lime juice. Urban Hero also makes low-fat adaptations of traditional varieties, like chorizo and andouille, and offers a half-dozen terrific soups each day.</p>
        <p>Summaries of reviews use the star system; others are culled from articles (indicated by +), the $25 and Under column (++) and Diner's Journal (+++).</p>
