        <p>Transderm Scop, a seasickness treatment in the form of a patch worn behind the ear, is again available. Production difficulties kept it off the market from 1994 until January. Studies reported by the Journal of Travel Medicine have found the patches to be as effective as antihistamine pills.</p>
        <p>A patch is worn for up to three days; a box of four is $20 to $22 and requires a prescription. Novartis, the manufacturer, says that the patches should not be used by children or anyone with glaucoma, urination problems or an allergy to scopolamine or other belladonna alkaloids. Alcohol should be avoided while the patch is worn. Two-thirds of users experience dryness of mouth.</p>
