        <p>My luggage was left uncovered on the tarmac during a torrential rainstorm. The contents got soaked. And my husband and I were repeatedly refused advance seat assignments for a return trip. Each of the four agents we encountered gave us a different reason. None made sense.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Speaking of ''How to Argue With Airlines'' (Practical Traveler, Feb. 8), I had two unpleasant airline experiences that took perseverance to resolve:</p>
        <p>My luggage was left uncovered on the tarmac during a torrential rainstorm. The contents got soaked. And my husband and I were repeatedly refused advance seat assignments for a return trip. Each of the four agents we encountered gave us a different reason. None made sense.</p>
        <p>My prompt, courteous letters to Customer Service brought no results. So I took my complaints directly to the presidents of the two carriers.</p>
        <p>Guess what? We got air travel vouchers by return mail. Not as generous as I think we deserved, but evidence that somebody up there cares about the customer.</p>
