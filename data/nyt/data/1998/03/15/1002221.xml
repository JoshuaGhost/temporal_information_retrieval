        <p>The shuttered American Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn., which introduced tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the Northeast to Shakespeare, is being resurrected after years of dormancy and decline.</p>
        <p>Officials from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection are expected to announce tomorrow the sale of the theater's 14-acre site, on the Housatonic River in the heart of Stratford's historic district, to a nonprofit organization, Stratford Festival Theater Inc. The group will pay $1.5 million in several installments, said its secretary-treasurer, Louis D. Pieteg.</p>
        <p>''It will be a boon for tourism and a cultural opportunity for Stratford, the state of Connecticut and the Northeast,'' Mr. Pieteg said.</p>
        <p>The overall project includes renovating the existing theater and building two smaller theaters, and is to include an academy and a museum. Costs could reach $180 million, a state official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pieteg said fund-raising would begin almost immediately. Financing is also being provided by Starcom, a company controlled by three Philadelphia businessmen. A structural and mechanical assessment of the existing theater will determine how much renovation is required. As a result, no firm date can be set for the first performance.</p>
        <p>''We would love to do something this summer,'' said Louis S. Burke, a South African theater producer with Broadway experience who will be artistic director of the new theater company.</p>
        <p>Built in 1955 and designed to resemble Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London, the 1,500-seat theater offered only midyear performances until its financial collapse forced it to close in 1982. It reopened only once, for a brief, failed summer run in 1989. The State of Connecticut bought the theater out of bankruptcy several years ago but never reopened it.</p>
        <p>In 1995, State Senator George (Doc) Gunther, a Stratford Republican, prepared a law to sell the theater and surrounding land to a private developer.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gunther said the law's strict requirements also delayed the purchase. The law required that the theater offer at least one production of Shakespeare every year for 20 years.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want a glitzy shopping center with hotels and motels,'' Mr. Gunther said. ''This is a beautiful location.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke said the new regional theater would operate year-round. Having moved to Stratford from New York in 1993, Mr. Burke directed a production of ''Murder in the Cathedral'' that opened Friday night at a Stratford church.</p>
        <p>Within 60 to 90 days, Mr. Burke's group must present a design and development plan to the state. A priority, Mr. Pieteg said, will be to determine the condition of the electrical, heating and plumbing systems in the theater. Mr. Burke recalled having noticed mushrooms sprouting in the foyer.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pieteg said the theater ''is in surprisingly good shape considering the length of time it has been closed.'' Built with teak, the theater was a vibrant cultural center for decades. Schoolchildren from Connecticut and other Northeastern states were often brought in buses to see their first performance of Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke began trying to buy the theater in 1990. The state selected his nonprofit group as its preferred developer in 1995, but negotiations to complete the sale lasted three years.</p>
        <p>''I think Shakespeare said it best,'' Mr. Burke said. ''He said, 'Perseverance, dear my Lord, keeps honor bright.' ''</p>
