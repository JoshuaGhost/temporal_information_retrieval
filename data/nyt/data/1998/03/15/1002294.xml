      <abstract>
        <p>John Barounis describes his new lounge, Exile, on New York's Upper West Side (S)</p>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>On a recent trip to Czechoslovakia, John Barounis was impressed by the rolling hills outside Prague, by the city's grungy but picturesque lounges, and by the city of Brno, which he described as a giant's playground of concrete blocks.</p>
        <p>He says he has fused these qualities into his new lounge, Exile, which he opened in February at 117 West 70th Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenues. One side is bordered by what he calls a ''rolling concrete wall,'' uniting Prague's curves with Brno's stark look.</p>

        <p>''Exile is an industrial lounge with a warm feel,'' said Mr. Barounis, who goes by Johnny B. and also owns the lounges the Musical Box at 219 Avenue B, at 13th Street, and the Auction House at 300 East 89th Street.</p>
        <p>Explosive-proof steel factory lights contrast with plush velour curtains; love seats jut up against walls with fake tobacco stains.</p>
        <p>NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.  Correction:  March 29, 1998, Sunday  A brief report on March 15 about Exile, a lounge, misstated the name of the country where the owner, John Barounis, said he found his inspiration on a recent visit. It was the Czech Republic, not Czechoslovakia.</p>
