        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Any writer whose book has as many opinions as my own ''Always in Pursuit'' expects to encounter disagreement, some of it very intense. But Walter Goodman's attempt to narrow my concerns and distort my meanings was quite surprising (Feb. 8). He cites long essays about Duke Ellington, William Faulkner and John Ford but never assesses them. He also fails to address the self-imposed adventures in essay form noted in the introduction, which are central to the shape, pace and sequencing of the book.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Any writer whose book has as many opinions as my own ''Always in Pursuit'' expects to encounter disagreement, some of it very intense. But Walter Goodman's attempt to narrow my concerns and distort my meanings was quite surprising (Feb. 8). He cites long essays about Duke Ellington, William Faulkner and John Ford but never assesses them. He also fails to address the self-imposed adventures in essay form noted in the introduction, which are central to the shape, pace and sequencing of the book.</p>
        <p>Goodman wants the reader to believe that all I do in the book is attack black nationalists and critics of America, but fails to make clear the range of my targets of disdain. In the long last essay, my paddling of Louis Farrakhan appears just before, to use one of Goodman's hand-me-down terms, my ''bashing'' of Patrick Buchanan. He distorts my take on affirmative action, which is that while I theoretically disagree with the idea of set-asides, I observe that none of its critics have come up with a solution that faces the documented, hard-core facts of racist hiring practices. What I have to say about the 1963 Birmingham bombing foreshadowing the horror of Oklahoma City, about popular culture, about race and film, about sex in the military, World War II, Colin Powell, pedophilia, the media, Anatole Broyard, contemporary slavery in West Africa, Benny Goodman, American writers choosing to segregate themselves while some of our most popular television shows and some of our best filmmakers have not, the relationship of anonymity to civility and a number of other subjects seems to have just whizzed by Goodman.</p>
        <p>His greatest obsessions -- nearly half of his review -- are the pieces on the O. J. Simpson trial and Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, which he calls ''rhapsodies'' to Johnnie Cochran and Brown, rather than acknowledging the complexity of my readings. If it were true that ''what Crouch most deeply admires and celebrates is black success, the American way,'' Eddie Murphy, Michael Jackson, Tupac Shakur and Russell Simmons would have been ''rhapsodized'' as well. Were Goodman to think of my central term, ''tragic optimism,'' he might get closer to my actual conception. Yet he finds the Simpson and Brown pieces ''less rewarding but more revealing'' than other essays. (They are also, the reader should know, much shorter than the big essays.) What Goodman means is that, faced with a complex vision that favors neither black nor white, neither male nor female, nor any class from the top to the bottom, and that acknowledges the tragedies of America as well as its triumphs, he would prefer to impose a talk-show level of revelation.</p>
