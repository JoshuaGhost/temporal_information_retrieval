        <p>MICHAEL LONDON returned to Brooklyn last year after an absence of 31 years, he said, ''to find the place I always wanted to live in New York more beautiful than I remembered it.'' For Mr. London, a native of Crown Heights who had spent his recent years in Lexington, Mass., that place was Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>Relocating to New York for a new job in the clothing industry, as a merchandise manager with the Rainbow Shops, Mr. London could have chosen a home anywhere in the city. But recalling the memories of his childhood, ''the first place I thought of was Brooklyn Heights,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But his wife wasn't so certain, particularly after they drove the length of Atlantic Avenue from Long Island and passed through several neighborhoods that appeared less than desirable.</p>
        <p>''I was very apprehensive, to say the least,'' said Berta London, Mr. London's wife of 16 years, who is originally from Denver and is the creator of Mrs. London's confections, which are made just outside Boston.</p>
        <p>Mrs. London found her feelings changing, however, as they made a right turn from Atlantic onto Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights. ''I said I could live here,'' she recalled. ''It was an instant knowledge that it was going to be O.K.''</p>
        <p>Mr. London had been leaning toward finding a home in a small elevator building. He credits his real estate agent, Elizabeth Celano of the William B. May agency, with opening up other possibilities.</p>
        <p>She showed them a little bit of everything, from high-rise buildings to garden apartments. They looked at nearly a dozen places before they bid on a duplex in St. George Tower, a converted high-rise hotel. ''We thought we bought it,'' said Mr. London.</p>
        <p>But after stepping out of the market for about three weeks they learned that the duplex had gone to a couple living in the building.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, the Londons said, it was clear that the loss of the duplex was meant to be. Mrs. London fell and fractured her hip on moving day at their former home in Lexington. Had they bought the duplex, moving in would have been problematic because she would have been unable to go upstairs for several weeks.</p>
        <p>It didn't hurt that they found something they liked even better: a garden floor-through apartment in a 153-year-old brownstone at 154 Clinton Street. With two wood-burning fireplaces, kitchen and dining room conducive to entertaining and a shared backyard, the two-bedroom, two-bath co-op captured their hearts. They bought it for $317,000, $8,000 less than the asking price.</p>
        <p>''It was the right space, the right configuration, with a lot of charm,'' said Mr. London.</p>
        <p>Although the apartment had been stripped of much of its original woodwork, the owner renovated the building using antique moldings, pocket doors and mantelpieces.</p>
        <p>For Mrs. London, the Old World charm of the house and the landmarked neighborhood were captivating. ''I love the fact that my lamp in the living room tilts,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The only negative was the rigor of buying a co-op. The idea of laying out their finances and being scrutinized by the other owners in their five-unit building was, they said, traumatic.</p>
        <p>''Buying a co-op in New York is worse than divorce,'' said Mr. London. ''Just the logistics of getting the work done.''</p>
        <p>But their apprehensions were quickly put to rest as they met their neighbors. These days, they look forward to meetings that Mr. London said ''are more fun than being at Comedy Central.''</p>
        <p>FOR the Londons, who love to entertain, the apartment is perfect, with a breakfast bar that separates the kitchen from the dining room but still leaves the two rooms open.</p>
        <p>The only problem with the apartment -- which has about 80 percent of the space of the condominium they had in Lexington -- was lack of storage space.</p>
        <p>To address the problem, they called on the husband of Mr. London's ex-wife, Richard Neves, a Long Island general contractor and cabinetmaker.</p>
        <p>He installed a large pantry and wine rack at the end of the kitchen, built narrow storage racks into the breakfast bar and turned a shallow nook (where doors once were) into deep bookshelves in the hallway.</p>
        <p>As much as they love their home, the couple seem even more enchanted with the neighborhood. From their first evening out, when they were greeted with free appetizers and desserts, they said, they have been welcomed with friendly gestures into shops and restaurants.</p>
        <p>In Lexington, just outside Boston, the couple's condo was one of 150 units set on 75 wooded acres. It was a more anonymous existence.</p>
        <p>''I went to the same supermarket for 10 years,'' said Mr. London. ''If I had died in the checkout line, they would have had to look in my wallet to see who I was. Here I go to the same place three times and they know my name. It feels like Brooklyn in the 50's. I feel comfortable and confident, like I'm coming home rather than coming into a strange land.''</p>
        <p>''It's just the most amazing place,'' Mrs. London said.</p>
        <p>In fact, its a place they intend to call home for many years. Mrs. London is already looking into an arrangement in which her candies would be made by students at an alternative high school, with part of the proceeds going to the school.</p>
        <p>''I just feel like maybe I lived here in a past life,'' Mrs. London said. ''There's something so familiar.''</p>
