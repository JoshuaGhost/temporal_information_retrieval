        <p>Few Serbs announce any qualms in the first moments of conversation, but not far beneath the surface outrage over the turmoil in Kosovo lurks opposition to any notion of fighting to keep the southern province.</p>
        <p>If President Slobodan Milosevic wanted to rally the Serbs to fight against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians -- as he did against the Croats and then the Bosnians -- he would be unable to do so, Serbian nationalists and political analysts said.</p>
        <p>Struggling to stay afloat in an economy crippled by war, sanctions and pervasive government corruption, many Serbs say they feel betrayed by Mr. Milosevic's failed promise of a greater Serbia. They want no part of an effort to hang on to the last morsel of it.</p>
        <p>''I personally feel apathetic even though I can understand the issue intellectually,'' said Ljubomir Tadic, 73, a professor of philosophy at the Academy of Sciences and a Serbian  nationalist who is angered that ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs so dramatically in Kosovo. ''People don't have pensions. The Americans have frozen our money. It is hard to get passionate about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tadic said Mr. Milosevic should start ''immediate'' negotiations with the Albanians in Kosovo and work toward granting the province more autonomy. Mr. Tadic -- like the American policy makers he says he despises -- is opposed to the ethnic Albanian demands for independence.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the Serbian Government made an appeal for a dialogue with the Kosovo Albanians, but many Albanians said they were not taking the gesture seriously.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the repression of Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces is a last chapter in the conflicts that Mr. Milosevic used to try and create a greater Serbia but which only tore the former Yugoslavia apart.</p>
        <p>But seven years after the start of those wars, Mr. Milosevic, now the isolated leader of an economic backwater, has spent the good will of his people.</p>
        <p>A poll published today in the independent newspaper Nedeljeni Telegraf showed that more than 70 percent of those asked said they were against close relatives' being sent to fight in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>To many here, Kosovo, where fewer than 200,000 Serbs live, seems a historical outpost. It hardly seems worth the expensive upkeep, they say. Unlike most civil servants in Serbia, the police who are stationed in Kosovo to control the Albanians  are paid their salaries by the Milosevic Government on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>A Serbian writer referred to Kosovo today as ''dead history,'' a place where beautiful Orthodox monasteries were revered but were not worth spilling blood over.</p>
        <p>''What is important is how to live better,'' said the writer, Slobodan Reljic. ''Our biggest problem is the threat of sanctions. Only a few people have relatives there.''</p>
        <p>Rather than seeing the chance for greater glory in Kosovo, many Serbs now see a lost cause, said Bratislav Grubavic, the editor of an influential newsletter VIP, which is distributed  in diplomatic circles.</p>
        <p>''Emotionally they care about it, but not to the extent of fighting for it,'' said Mr. Grubavic. ''They are sad that it is a lost cause and it can't be under Serb control. Consciously or subconsciously they know Serbs have lost wars, and they know Kosovo will be a final act in this show.''</p>
        <p>But such realism does not mean that Mr. Milosevic will respond to popular feeling or give in quickly to Western demands for serious negotiations, Mr. Grubavic said.</p>
        <p>Serbian police action against the Albanians will probably not end any time soon, he said. Part of Mr. Milosevic's strategy in using the police to pummel the Albanians in Kosovo, he said, was to weaken Ibrahim Rugova, their leader, whom Washington has encouraged to open talks with Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>While many Serbs said they were prepared to grant Kosovo autonomy, some Serbian nationalists have said that in order to maintain the ''purest'' Serbia, Kosovo should be allowed to secede.</p>
        <p>This theory was put forward a year ago by members of the Serbian  Academy of Sciences who argued that because of the high birth rate among Albanians in Kosovo, Serbs would be outnumbered by other groups in Serbia within a decade.</p>
        <p>At present, demographers estimate that Serbs make up about 62 percent of the 11 million population of Serbia and that non-Serbs, including Albanians, Hungarians and Bulgarians, make up 38 percent.</p>
        <p>Even in Mr. Milosevic's hometown of Pozarevac, 50 miles south of Belgrade, the passion for war has long evaporated, said Dragoslav Cvetic, an editor at Radio Bum, an independent station there.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Milosevic is so unpopular that he can no longer resort to the nationalist argument to resurrect his image. ''People don't have money, and they are very concerned about that,'' Mr. Cvetic said. ''Milosevic is very afraid that the Americans are like demons. He doesn't have the courage to defy them, and he wouldn't have any support from the Serbs if he did.''</p>
        <p>Contrasting the atmosphere in the early 1990's, when Mr. Milosevic whipped the Serbs into a frenzy of war and the fatigue today, Milorad Tadic, a Belgrade truck driver, said: ''Then we were fighting for Serbia. Now we would be fighting for Milosevic's throne. I wouldn't give one hair for Kosovo or for Milosevic.''</p>
