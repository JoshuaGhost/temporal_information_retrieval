        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Lewis (column, March 9) rails against the independent counsel law. I agree that it is ill conceived and dangerous. However, I believed this when it was enacted and each time the Democratic Party forced its renewal. Mr. Lewis now opposes the law when President Clinton is its target. Yet where was Mr. Lewis when the independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was conducting his campaign against Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush (''Accounting for Power,'' column, June 19, 1987)?</p>
