        <p>After a session that illuminated sharp disagreements, Senator John McCain, the pivotal Senator on the tobacco issue, said today that he could now separate the central questions from the more secondary ones.</p>
        <p>In the first category, issues that must be resolved before legislation can go forward, Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, listed these topics:</p>
        <p>*The extent of tobacco companies' protection from lawsuits.</p>
        <p>*How the Food and Drug Administration would regulate tobacco.</p>
        <p>*The goals for the reduction in youth smoking and the fines that would be imposed on cigarette manufacturers if the goals were not met.</p>
        <p>*How much the price of a pack of cigarettes would be increased.</p>
        <p>On the more peripheral issues, Mr. McCain listed such questions as the size of lawyers' fees, the future of the Government's tobacco-price support program and the way the money raised from cigarette manufacturers would be distributed and spent.</p>
        <p>There are major disputes over these secondary matters, Mr. McCain said in an interview after a hearing of the Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, but the fate of the legislation does not hinge on their resolution.</p>
        <p>While the senators debated tobacco issues today, new figures showed that tobacco interests have been spending an extraordinary amount, more than $75 million over the last two years, lobbying Congress and the Federal agencies.</p>
        <p>House Democrats led by Representatives Vic Fazio and Henry A. Waxman, both of California, offered tough anti-smoking legislation that included a big price increase on cigarettes and no industry protection against lawsuits except for those filed by Federal, state and local governments. The bill is a companion to legislation proposed by Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement that tobacco companies reached last June with 40 state attorneys general, the industry would be given immunity from further government lawsuits and private class-action suits and considerable protection against other legal claims.</p>
        <p>In return, the cigarette makers would restrain their advertising and marketing and pay a large sum to settle punitive damage claims based on past industry practices.</p>
