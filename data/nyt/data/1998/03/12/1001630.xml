        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your March 8 news article on adjunct professors in the City University of New York: As a recent Ph.D. who has taught at CUNY for 15 years, I earn about $18,000 dollars a year for three classes a semester. A beginning assistant professor, with exactly the same qualifications, receives $40,000 to $45,000, plus benefits.</p>

        <p>Some departments practice reverse seniority: administrators threaten longstanding adjuncts who have climbed up the pay scale by pointing to the even lower cost of new graduate students. While adjuncts can form 60 percent or more of a department's faculty, they usually have no say in department governance.</p>

        <p>The writer is an adjunct assistant professor at Queens College.</p>
