        <p>India's main Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata, edged closer to forming a new government today as key regional parties began rallying to the nationalists, bringing them closer to a majority in the newly elected Parliament.</p>
        <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party has governed in several northern and western Indian states but only once in New Delhi, in an abortive administration that lasted 13 days in 1996.</p>
        <p>But the party's years of frustration appear to be nearly over as several parties in widely separated regions declared their backing for a government led by the B.J.P. or offered hints that they would set aside traditional antipathies for Hindu nationalism and offer parliamentary support.</p>
        <p>The Hindu nationalists' prospects brightened as final election results were announced for all but a handful of the parliamentary seats.</p>
        <p>The results show that Bharatiya Janata and its allies won 250 of the 543 seats under contest. That showing is by far the Hindu nationalists' best in nearly 50 years of campaigning, and it leaves them only 22 seats short of the majority of 272 that they need to form a governing coalition when Parliament meets later this month.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Congress Party, the Hindu nationalists' traditional foe, said they would try to block the nationalists by forging a ''secular front'' with the third major political bloc, the United Front.</p>
        <p>The results gave the Congress Party and its electoral allies 166 seats and the United Front 98 seats, for a combined total of 264, 8 seats short of a majority.</p>
        <p>In Indian politics, the word secular denotes opposition to politics based on ethnic or religious bias, a charge opponents have leveled against the Hindu nationalists.</p>
        <p>A further 21 seats were won by an array of splinter parties and independent candidates; 10 seats are to be filled later, 8 by elections and 2 by appointment. But in the fast-eddying politics that developed in the aftermath of the results, the focus was on regional groups that entered the election as ''poll allies'' of one of the three main power blocs, only to find that the inconclusive outcome left them as potential kingmakers.</p>
        <p>The key group appears to be a 12-member regional party in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. That group, the Telugu Desam Party, was aligned in the election with the United Front, an alliance of 13 regional and leftist parties. But the party appears to be mulling a switch to the B.J.P. alliance.</p>
        <p>In Hyderabad, the state capital, the party's leader, Chandrababu Naidu, who is the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, said he would meet with other United Front leaders in New Delhi on Thursday. ''There we will discuss everything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naidu's maneuvering was a surprise, since Mr. Naidu, 46, had been touted as a potential Prime Minister in a United Front-led government. But his calculations appear to be driven by local politics in Andhra Pradesh. There, the ''first enemy'' for the Telugu Desam Party, in Mr. Naidu's words, is not the B.J.P. but the Congress Party, which will face the Telugu Desam in a state election in the next 20 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naidu's dilemma captures the new realities of Indian politics. After decades of domination by parties with national bases, principally the Congress Party, power has shifted increasingly to sectional groups that reflect India's mosaic of ethnic groups, languages and regions. The power base of these groups is in the states, and their alignments in New Delhi tend to follow calculations of political advantage at home.</p>
        <p>Similar considerations appear to have driven two other regional groups. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, leader of a breakaway Congress Party group allied with the Hindu nationalists in the elections, pledged her seven parliamentary seats in ''conditional support'' of a B.J.P. government. In the face of rumors that Ms. Banerjee might defect back to Congress, this came as a major relief to the nationalists.</p>
        <p>In Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha Jayaram, a former movie actress who scored a stunning comeback after a corruption scandal that drove her from power in the state two years ago, said she would pledge her 18 seats to the Hindu nationalists, although her party would not join the government.</p>
        <p>Most Congress leaders credited the campaign of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister who was assassinated in 1991, with saving the party from an even worse result.</p>
        <p>But as they reviewed the party's performance in states where Mrs. Gandhi drew huge crowds, those leaders concluded that the party had done well where it had strong regional alliances or a strong local organization of its own, and badly where it had no alliance or a local organization that had atrophied.</p>
        <p>There was evident frustration with Sitaram Kesri, 82, the Congress Party's president. Mani Shankar Aiyar, a former Congress member of Parliament from Tamil Nadu, said Mr. Kesri had turned him down when he had suggested an electoral alliance with Ms. Jayaram, who then turned to Bharatiya Janata.</p>
        <p>''If the B.J.P. has been successful, it is because it is a bad party with a good leader,'' Mr. Shankar Aiyar said. ''If the Congress Party has done badly, it is because it is a good party with a bad leader.''</p>
        <p>The pacts with Ms. Banerjee and Ms. Jayaram were among a dozen regional alliances that underpinned Bharatiya Janata's strong showing. A breakdown of voting patterns showed that the B.J.P.'s share of the 344 million votes cast was 25 per cent, up 5 per cent from the last election in 1996. But its choice of regional allies added another 12 per cent of the popular vote and 72 seats to the party's own total of 178.</p>
        <p>The Congress Party won 26 per cent of the vote, but its regional allies added only 4 per cent of the popular vote and 26 seats to its 140 seats.</p>
        <p>The difference is apparent in six states -- Punjab, West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu -- where the B.J.P. won a total of only six seats in 1996. Through their regional allies, the Hindu nationalists turned this into a haul of 85 seats. In two key states where the Hindu nationalists control state governments and relied on candidates of their own, they lost 16 seats, mostly to the Congress Party.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Bharatiya Janata leaders -- stung by their humiliation in 1996, when their minority government collapsed within two weeks for lack of parliamentary support -- said they would wait for firm pledges of majority support before trying to form a government.</p>
        <p>But Pramod Mahajan, the party's general secretary, indicated that their stand had changed as they reviewed the returns. ''I think that we can consider 260 seats a working majority, as long as other parties don't vote against us,'' he said.</p>
